\section{Actors Identification and Use Cases}

\subsection{Identification of Actors}
This section identifies the primary and secondary actors who interact with the MindCare-IA system. An actor represents a role that a user or system plays when interacting with the application.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{10cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Actor} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
Patient & End user seeking mental health support. Patients can schedule appointments, communicate with therapists, track their mood, maintain a personal journal, and interact with the AI chatbot. They represent the primary users who utilize the platform to manage their mental health journey and receive therapeutic support. \\
\hline
Therapist & Mental health professional providing care. Therapists manage patient relationships, conduct therapy sessions, view patient mood data, maintain session notes, and manage their availability calendar. They bring clinical expertise to the platform and serve as the primary care providers. \\
\hline
Admin & System administrator responsible for platform configuration, user verification, monitoring system health, and managing technical aspects of the platform. Admins ensure the proper functioning of the system and handle exceptional cases. \\
\hline
AI Engine & Core system component that provides intelligent processing capabilities including therapeutic recommendations, mood analysis, journal analysis, and crisis detection. It enhances therapeutic interactions through natural language processing and machine learning. \\
\hline
Chatbot & Conversational interface that interacts directly with patients, providing immediate support, therapeutic conversations, and guided activities using the AI Engine's capabilities. \\
\hline
Notification System & System component responsible for delivering alerts, reminders, and messages to users across various channels including in-app notifications and email. \\
\hline
Media Handler & System component that manages the secure upload, storage, and retrieval of media files including profile pictures, session documents, and shared resources. \\
