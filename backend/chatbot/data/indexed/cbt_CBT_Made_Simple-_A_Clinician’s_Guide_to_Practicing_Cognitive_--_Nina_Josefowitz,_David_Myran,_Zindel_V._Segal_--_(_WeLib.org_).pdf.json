Some of these changes, such as moving from a five-column to a seven-column\nthought record, have been triggered by internal innovations and have helped extend CBT\u2019s relevance\nto disorders falling outside the orbit of its initial validation for depression and anxiety. Other modifications, such as focusing on strengths and balancing acceptance and change, have come in response to\nexternal challenges from other therapy models. With all this movement in the field it can be difficult\nfor therapists to return to the basic elements of this approach in a way that is shorn of trends and niche\napplications. On this point, in fact, I am frequently approached by trainees who are interested in learning about mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. When I ask them about their CBT background, they\nsay it is minimal and they don\u2019t see much need for it. The impression I have is that they are eager to\nleapfrog past the CBT essentials in order to get to the work they find more interesting. They tend to be\nsurprised at my response, which often runs counter to their wishes and stresses that one can\u2019t get very\nfar in learning new CBT variants when the basic model is only weakly understood.\nCBT Made Simple does an enviable job in providing just this type of clinically pragmatic and skillbased grounding in CBT theory and interventions. Stemming from Nina Josefowitz and David Myran\u2019s\ntwo-decade-long careers as cognitive therapists, teachers, supervisors, and academics, this book exemplifies the best qualities of user-friendly, explicit guidance that offers valuable insights into the nuts and\nbolts of CBT to all levels of learners.\nFor example, the decision to write this book with a structure that coheres to an actual therapy\nsession is highly innovative. Agendas are set, homework is assigned and reviewed, and learning covers\nspecific skill sets that are relevant to the material being covered. Here we see CBT at its finest. Rather\nthan imparting this information in a purely theoretical manner, CBT Made Simple invites the reader to\nlearn through doing.\nNina and David rightly argue that it is only through the experiential immersion in CBT principles\nand interventions that the reader will optimize their book\u2019s value. How much more can be learned from\ngiving yourself a homework assignment and monitoring its performance or even nonperformance? Or\nscheduling your activities in a typical day and noticing whether life permits them to be achieved in\ntheir predetermined order? This approach, to my mind, is what separates CBT Made Simple from many\nother books touching on the same theme. It also shows how one of the metaconcepts in CBT, guided\ndiscovery, can be brought to bear on all aspects of therapeutic learning, whether inside or outside the\nactual therapy session. Readers who agree to take the plunge and work with the book in this manner\nwill not be disappointed.\nCBT Made Simple is divided into parts that follow the different phases of CBT work and emphasize\nimportant formulation principles along with ongoing assessment in order to ensure that the most\nappropriate techniques are being employed. The early chapters focus on identifying client strengths\n[Page 11]\nviii CBT Made Simple\nand problem complaints as well as setting therapy goals. The reader then moves on to unpacking and\nhelping clients regulate emotionally evocative situations through seeing the interplay of thoughts, feelings, physical sensations, and behavior. Problem solving and action plans follow, along with the specific\napplication of exposure and activation exercises. The writing is very accessible and the numerous\ngraphics and interactive forms used ensure that the reader is engaged, present, and invited to use these\nempirically supported interventions to enhance emotional and cognitive well-being. This may be a tall\norder for any book to fill, but CBT Made Simple has filled it in an exemplary manner.\n\u2014 Zindel Segal\nProfessor of Psychology, University of Toronto\nCo-founder, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy\n[Page 12]\nIntroduction\nHello, I am Nina Josefowitz. I have been a psychologist, cognitive behavioral therapist, and teacher for\nover twenty-five years. My partner in writing this book is David Myran, a psychiatrist who has also\npracticed and taught cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for over twenty-five years. We hope this book\nwill help you start to use CBT in your own therapy practice as well as your own life. While we have\nwritten the book together, we decided to mainly use my writing style, and therefore the book is written\nfrom the singular first person point of view.\nLet\u2019s begin with defining CBT. CBT is an evidence-based approach to understanding and treating\npsychological problems. It is a structured, active form of therapy in which the client\u2019s goals are set in\nthe beginning and are addressed throughout therapy. CBT is based on four fundamental principles:\n1. How people understand the world, or how they think, influences how they feel, their physical\nreactions, and how they behave. This means that clients\u2019 problems can be understood in terms\nof how their thoughts, feelings, physical reactions, and behavior interact and maintain their\nproblems.\n2. Clients can learn to become aware of their thoughts, and CBT interventions can help clients\nchange their thoughts.\n3. When clients change how they think, their feelings, physical reactions, and behaviors will also\nchange.\n4. Because thoughts, feelings, physical reactions, and behaviors are interrelated, when clients\nchange their behaviors, this will also impact their thoughts, feelings, and physical reactions.\nCBT was first developed in the 1970s as a treatment for depression (Beck, 1970; Beck, Rush, Shaw,\n& Emery, 1979). At the time, I was a young graduate student at the University of Toronto, just learning\nhow to be a therapist. The dominant therapeutic orientations were Rogerian, gestalt, and psychodynamic. The focused structure of CBT, combined with actively addressing thoughts, was a completely\nnovel and very exciting approach.\nI can remember the moment I became a committed CBT therapist. I was about to apply for my first\npracticum in graduate school. Try to imagine: I am sitting on the bus on the way to the interview,\nfeeling anxious. For some reason, the bus stops for twenty minutes. I realize that I am going to be late\nand that there is absolutely nothing I can do (at that time there were no cell phones). My anxiety rises.\nThen\u2026I remember my CBT class from the previous day. I take a deep breath and ask myself, What am\nI thinking? Well, my thoughts are I will be late; my career is ruined! I will never get a practicum placement,\n[Page 13]\n2 CBT Made Simple\nand I will fail graduate school. I start to laugh at myself. Even in my highly anxious state, I knew I was\ncatastrophizing. That was the moment I became a CBT therapist.\nIn the past fifty years, hundreds of studies have examined both the underlying theory as well as the\neffectiveness of CBT for children and adults of all ages (Beck & Dozois, 2011). Let me give you an idea\nof the extensiveness of the research. Hofmann, Asnaani, Vonk, Sawyer, and Fang (2012) examined\nmeta-analyses of the effectiveness of CBT. They found that while the research is stronger for some\ndisorders than others, generally CBT has been found to be an effective therapy compared with a placebo\nor waiting list control group for a great variety of problems, including depression, bipolar disorder,\nanxiety disorders, abuse of alcohol and drugs, schizophrenia, eating disorders, insomnia, personality\ndisorders, anger and aggression, criminal behaviors, general stress, distress due to a variety of medical\nconditions, and chronic pain.\nHow This Book Is Organized\nYou can think of therapy as similar to constructing a building; you need to start with a solid foundation. In part 1 we are going to learn how to lay the foundation of CBT. A good foundation consists of\nobtaining a clear sense of your client\u2019s problems and goals, explaining CBT to your client, and starting\nto use a structured format. You want a foundation that is waterproof, that will stand up to storms and\nsupport a heavy building, which means that even if your client is very distressed and goes through hard\ntimes, the early work you do in laying down the foundation will serve you and your client well.\nThe next step is putting up the scaffolding. Without a good framework, you can\u2019t put up the walls\nand windows. In part 2 you will learn to identify your clients\u2019 feelings, physical reactions, behaviors, and\nthoughts and create a four-factor model that will provide the framework for understanding your clients\u2019\nproblems.\nThe final stage in building a house involves putting up the walls, windows, and doors. Good contractors take their time; they know that the building needs a solid structure. The same is true in CBT.\nPart 3 covers cognitive and behavioral interventions. We will focus on a variety of cognitive interventions, including examining the evidence for negative thoughts, helping clients take a new perspective,\nand developing balanced or alternative thoughts. We will also cover three behavioral interventions:\nproblem solving, behavioral activation, and exposure therapy.\nFinally, in part 4 we look at the complete house. We bring CBT to life with an overview of CBT for\ntwo hypothetical clients we will follow throughout the book, Suzanne and Raoul. This final section\nalso delves into core beliefs and their importance in CBT. As you work through the book and start to\nmaster CBT concepts and skills, you will be laying a solid foundation you can draw upon to help your\nclients achieve their goals and solve the problems that brought them into therapy.\nCBT theory and interventions are relevant to people of all ethnic backgrounds, sexual orientations, cultures, and religions. Throughout the book I have tried to refer to \u201cpartners\u201d rather than\nspecify the gender of the partner to ensure that heterosexuality is not assumed. In my own practice I\nnever assume a client\u2019s sexual orientation without first checking. Also, when I refer to hypothetical\nclients in the book, I alternate the client\u2019s gender with each chapter. For simplicity\u2019s sake, the therapist\nis always female.\nCBT sessions follow a specific structure, so I thought it would be helpful if the structure of each\nchapter in this book mimicked the structure of an actual therapy session. Each chapter begins with a\n[Page 14]\nIntroduction 3\ncheck-in and review of the homework from the previous chapter and then sets the agenda, which outlines the main focus of the chapter. We then work through the agenda, learning the specific skills\ncovered in the chapter. At the end of each chapter I assign homework, and you are given an opportunity to review what you have learned. My hope is that the structure of the chapters will give you a sense\nof what a structured CBT session is like.\nHow People Learn\nThe research is clear: to learn a new skill, you not only need new information, but you also need\nactive strategies to help you remember and practice the material you learn (O\u2019Brien et al., 2001). The\nchallenge is how to incorporate active learning into a book.\nFirst, if you want to remember something, you need to regularly review. The review can be quick;\neven spending a minute or two will make a difference. At the end of every chapter is a review section,\nwhere you will have a chance to think about what was important to you. In addition, I start every\nchapter with a quick review of the preceding chapter.\nSecond, research also indicates that actively answering questions and testing yourself helps you\nremember (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006). At the end of each chapter is a list of the main topics we have\ncovered, and after each topic is a question. Try to answer the questions. If you are unsure of the\nanswers, then go back to that section of the chapter.\nThird, it is hard to remember what you learned unless you apply the material and practice. The\ndata is very clear: the more you practice, the better you get. There is simply no getting around it\u2014if you\nwant to learn a new therapy skill, you need to practice. Throughout the text I have included exercises\nthat I call YOUR TURN! They are an opportunity for you to practice the concept we have just covered.\nThe answers to the YOUR TURN! exercises are in the appendix. You can download additional exercises at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501 (see below). Finally, at the end of each chapter I have\nsuggested homework for you to complete before moving on to the next chapter. This is an opportunity\nfor you to bring CBT into your own therapy practice. I think you will enjoy doing the various\nexercises.\nCBT and You\nOver the years I have found that applying CBT to my own life has not only helped me cope better\nwith various situations, but has also enhanced my CBT skills. Recent research supports my experience\nthat when we apply CBT to ourselves, we become better CBT therapists (Bennett-Levy & Lee, 2014).\nThroughout the book I have exercises where I ask you to apply CBT to your own life. Try them; I think\nyou will find them helpful.\nOnline Materials\nIn addition to all of the content in this book, there is a wealth of reproducible supplemental material available for you to download at New Harbinger\u2019s companion website, http://www.newharbinger\n.com/38501.\n[Page 15]\n4 CBT Made Simple\nHandouts. On the website, you will find handouts that you can use with your clients, including worksheets and lists of helpful questions.\n\uf09d\nExercises. These are opportunities for extra practice and for delving into concepts at a more complex\nlevel. These exercises are clearly marked in the book with the icon shown here.\n\uf0b2\nAudio files. You can find audio files, including the YOUR TURN! Practice in Your Imagination exercises, which are marked with the icon shown here.\n\uf0be\nVideo clips. Starting in chapter 2, I have short video clips where I demonstrate the skill we have just\ncovered. They are marked with the icon shown here. We will follow two clients, Charlotte and John,\nwho are a combination of many of my clients over the years. Before watching the video clips, please go\nto http://www.newharbinger.com/38501 and download the short written overview, Charlotte\u2019s and\nJohn\u2019s Psychosocial Histories and Presenting Problems.\nConclusion\nThroughout our careers, David and I have remained enthusiastic about CBT\u2019s capacity to help clients\nmake practical, helpful changes in their lives. We have found that practicing CBT is often fun and\nengaging as clients start to make real changes. If you are new to CBT, we think this book will give you\na solid start; if you have been practicing CBT for a while, we think this book will help you increase your\neffectiveness. This book demonstrates how David and I do therapy. All therapists have their own style,\nand there is clearly no one right way to practice CBT. As you read over the sample dialogues, see if\nthere are ways that we practice that you would like to incorporate into your own therapy style.\nOne last word before you start reading the first chapter: do try the exercises. The reality is if you\nwant to learn something new, you have to practice!\n[Page 16]\nPART 1\nCBT Foundation [Page 17]\nCHAPTER 1\nUse CBT Theory to\nUnderstand Your Clients\nLet\u2019s get started with laying our foundation. In this chapter, you\u2019ll learn the basics of CBT and will have\nthe opportunity to put your knowledge into practice with hypothetical clients, your own clients, and\nyourself.\nAt the beginning of each chapter, we will do a check-in and review. This is also the first step in a\nCBT session. It is an opportunity for you to reflect on how you have used CBT in your clinical practice\nand in your own life, as well as to think about the previous chapter\u2019s homework. Since this is the first\nchapter, there is no homework to review. However, before you start reading the next section, take a\nmoment and pay attention to your thoughts and feelings about starting to learn CBT. Try to separate\nyour thoughts from your feelings. Did you learn anything from this simple exercise?\nSet the Agenda\nThe second step in a CBT session is to set the agenda for the session, or specify the topics you will be\naddressing. In this chapter, we are going to start to use CBT to understand clients\u2019 problems. I have four\nagenda items that are related to learning basic CBT theory.\nAgenda Item #1: CBT building blocks: thoughts, feelings, physical reactions, and behavior\nAgenda Item #2: How thoughts maintain problems\nAgenda Item #3: How behaviors maintain problems\nAgenda Item #4: How core beliefs influence thoughts\nWork the Agenda\nThe third step in a CBT session is to work the agenda, or address your clients\u2019 problems; in our case,\nthis means learning the information and skills related to each agenda item.\n[Page 18]\nUse CBT Theory to Understand Your Clients 7\nClients come to you with a variety of problems. They may be depressed; they may be using drugs\nor drinking too much; they may be feeling anxious; or they may be unhappy for a variety of reasons and\nwant to find a way to make their lives better. When a client first comes into my office, two main questions go through my mind. First, how can I help my client understand his problems in a way that makes\nsense to him and helps him feel hopeful? Second, how can I understand my client\u2019s problems in a way\nthat leads to helpful interventions? To answer these questions, you need a good theory\u2014one that is\nextremely practical and helps both you and your client understand the factors that caused his problems,\nand that are currently maintaining his problems. A good theory also leads to effective interventions\nthat make sense to the client. So, before we start with how to \u201cdo\u201d CBT, it is important to understand\nthe underlying theory of CBT.\nAgenda Item #1: CBT Building Blocks: Thoughts, Feelings,\nPhysical Reactions, and Behavior\nWhen we are upset, our reactions can feel overwhelming. It can be hard to figure out what is\nmaking us upset, and we often blame the situation. Imagine a client named Rose. She is twenty-five\nyears old, lives at home, and has just finished college. She is trying to find a job and has applied for a\nnumber of different positions. Yesterday Rose received another rejection letter. She sat in her room all\nnight, feeling very depressed, surfing the Internet, and crying. The next day, Rose tells her therapist\nthat she is depressed because she didn\u2019t get the job. It is natural that Rose is upset and, of course, if she\nhad gotten the job she would be feeling differently. You can think of Rose\u2019s reaction to the rejection\nletter as a big jumble of thoughts, feelings, physical reactions, and behaviors, all crammed into a heavy\nbackpack that she lugs around. You are going to help her unpack the backpack. She will open the backpack and sort out her thoughts, feelings, physical reactions, and behaviors separately. I call this the\nfour-factor model. The four-factor model provides a structure that you and your clients can use to\nunderstand the factors that are maintaining their problems. When clients have a structure for understanding their reactions, they often start to feel less overwhelmed and believe change is more possible.\nOnce unpacked, the backpack is lighter. When her feelings, physical reactions, behaviors, and\nthoughts are on the floor in neat piles, Rose can start to think about what she wants to keep for the\njourney, what she wants to change, and what she no longer needs to lug around. I can almost hear her\nsay, \u201cWhew\u2014what a relief!\u201d\nLet\u2019s see what happens when we unpack her backpack and sort Rose\u2019s reaction into the four factors.\nSituation: Another rejection letter\nRose\u2019s Thoughts: I will never get a job, I am such a failure.\nRose\u2019s Feelings: Depressed and hopeless.\nRose\u2019s Physical Reactions: Stomach hurts and is exhausted.\nRose\u2019s Behavior: She stayed in her bedroom, surfed the Internet, and cried. Rose skipped her gym\nclass the next morning because she slept in. She did not bother applying for another job that was\nadvertised in the paper the next day.\n[Page 19]\n8 CBT Made Simple\nAs you and Rose sort out her reaction using the four-factor model, her reaction begins to make\nmore sense to her and is less of an overwhelming jumble.\nPadesky and Mooney (1990) include a fifth factor\u2014the environment\u2014in their model of how the\nfactors influence each other, as shown in figure 1.1.\nENVIRONMENT\nThoughts\nPhysical\nMoods\nReactions\nBehaviors\nFigure reprinted from Mind Over Mood with permission of the copyright holder. Copyright 1986 Christine A. Padesky,\nhttp://www.mindovermood.com.\nFigure 1.1. Five-part model to understand life experiences.\nWhen you look at figure 1.1, you see how change in one of the four factors influences change in the\nother three areas. Once we have a model for understanding our clients\u2019 reactions, we can start to think\nabout how to change their reactions so that they are less upset and can cope better. The four-factor\nmodel also makes sense to clients; they can start to use it immediately to understand their distress.\nWHAT IS A SITUATION?\nThe four-factor model separates thoughts, feelings, physical reactions, and behavior from the situation. The situation is what actually occurred, or the objective reality without any interpretation. For\nexample, an upcoming test is a situation; a \u201chard\u201d upcoming test is a situation and an interpretation\u2014\nthe interpretation is that the test will be hard. Let\u2019s take another example of a situation: your client tells\nyou that a kid at school approached him in the hallway and said, \u201cYou\u2019re ugly.\u201d This is a situation. If\nyour client adds, \u201cThat kid is mean and trying to show off,\u201d this is your client\u2019s interpretation.\n[Page 20]\nUse CBT Theory to Understand Your Clients 9\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FEELINGS AND THOUGHTS?\nIn the four-factor model, you want to separate feelings from thoughts. This seems like a fairly easy\ntask, but in our everyday language, we tend to confuse thoughts and feelings. For example, we say, \u201cI\nfeel like he doesn\u2019t like me,\u201d when what we really mean is, \u201cI think he doesn\u2019t like me.\u201d Because of our\ntendency to confuse thoughts and feelings, one of the hardest skills to learn in CBT is differentiating\nthe two. For starters, feelings are usually one word, such as sad, mad, happy, worried, embarrassed,\nanxious, and excited, whereas thoughts generally come in the form of sentences or phrases.\nIn CBT we refer to the thoughts we have in specific situations as automatic thoughts. Our automatic thoughts happen very quickly and are just below a conscious level of awareness. Thoughts are\nbased on what a situation means to us, or our interpretation. For example, a man approaches you on\nthe street and asks for directions. If your initial thought is He is part of a pickpocket scam, you will also\nthink, He\u2019s dangerous; I want to get away. However, if your initial thought is He\u2019s a tourist, you may also\nthink, How can I help him? I want to be friendly.\nAutomatic thoughts are words or images that go through our head. Many of our automatic thoughts\nare about very ordinary things, such as I wonder if it will rain today? or, as you leave the house, Do I have\nmy shopping list? We don\u2019t have strong emotional reactions to these kinds of thoughts, and in CBT we\nusually don\u2019t pay much attention to them. In CBT, we are more interested in thoughts that are connected to strong negative feelings as well as those that are judgments about ourselves, others, or the\nfuture. For example, a thought about oneself might be I am stupid, while a thought about others might\nbe My mother is inconsiderate, and a thought about the future might be Everyone will laugh at me. These\nthoughts are usually just below your awareness, but if you ask yourself, What was I thinking? you can\nusually identify them.\nAutomatic thoughts are spontaneous and rapid; we have a lot of them, and they come and go so\nquickly that we often don\u2019t notice them. However, once we notice our thoughts, we can start to examine\nthem, and in the process begin to change them. Once we change our thoughts, our feelings and behaviors also change.\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FEELINGS AND\nPHYSICAL REACTIONS?\nPhysical reactions are changes in your body (e.g., sweating, tingling, or tension). Strong feelings are\naccompanied by physical reactions, and it is often hard to separate out a feeling from how your body is\nreacting. For instance, when you feel anxious your body may become tense, your heart may beat more\nquickly, and you may sweat. People can have the same feelings but different physical reactions.\nIndividuals also differ in the intensity of their physical reactions. It can be very helpful to ask about your\nclient\u2019s specific physical reactions and their intensity. Some people are aware of their physical reactions\nbut are unaware of how they are feeling. For these clients, identifying physical reactions can be a good\nplace to start understanding feelings.\nPeople can also have thoughts about their physical reactions. For example, if you blush, does this\njust mean your cheeks are flushed or does blushing mean you are making a fool of yourself and that\nothers will make fun of you?\n[Page 21]\n10 CBT Made Simple\nWHAT ABOUT BEHAVIOR?\nBehavior is what we do (e.g., sit, talk to a child, give a presentation). It is helpful to identify behavior\nas a separate factor so you can start to explore how the other three factors influence your client\u2019s behavior and also look at the consequences of your client\u2019s behavior. When we look at symptom maintenance\ncycles later in the chapter, we will focus on how a client\u2019s behavior can maintain his symptoms.\nYOUR TURN!\nIdentify Situations, Thoughts, Feelings,\nPhysical Reactions, and Behavior\nThroughout this book you will come across YOUR TURN! exercises. This is an opportunity to practice what you just learned. I think you will find them interesting! Try this first one.\nLook over the following examples and see if you can identify whether they are situations, thoughts,\nfeelings, physical reactions, or behaviors. You can find my answers in the appendix.\nIdentify Situations, Thoughts, Feelings,\nPhysical Reactions, and Behavior\nSituation, Thought, Feeling, Physical\nReaction, or Behavior?\nStaying up late and studying\nNo matter what I do, no one likes me.\nI feel tense all over.\nEven if I study hard, I will still fail.\nI am so happy.\n[Page 22]\nUse CBT Theory to Understand Your Clients 11\nMy boss hates my work.\nI am late for work.\nAgenda Item #2: How Thoughts Maintain Problems\nWe\u2019ve talked about the importance of sorting out your client\u2019s reactions using the four factors:\nthoughts, feelings, physical reactions, and behavior. We now want to use the four-factor model to\nunderstand what is maintaining your clients\u2019 problems. Let\u2019s start with understanding the role of\nthoughts.\nOur thoughts, or our interpretation of the situation, lead to our feelings, physical reactions, and\nbehavior. For example, when Rose received the rejection letter, she thought, I will never get a job, I am\nsuch a failure. If these are her thoughts, it makes sense that she feels depressed and hopeless. However,\nif she had thought I will try again, something else will come along, she would have felt neutral or mildly\nhopeful. Different thoughts lead to very different feelings, physical reactions, and behavior. Look at\nfigure 1.2. We start with a specific situation; our immediate understanding of the situation leads to our\nthoughts, which lead to our feelings, physical reactions, and behavior. For the moment we are going to\nput feelings and physical reactions in the same box, as they are so closely related.\nFeelings\nSituation Thoughts Behavior\nPhysical Reactions\nFigure 1.2. Our thoughts influence our feelings, physical reactions, and behavior.\nLet\u2019s start with looking at an example of how thoughts influence feelings, physical reactions, and\nbehavior in everyday life. I have a very cute, little black dog called Shadey. Despite my best efforts, he\n[Page 23]\n12 CBT Made Simple\nbarks furiously every time I come home. I don\u2019t pay much attention to his barking; I think, He\u2019ll stop in\na minute. He is so cute. Even though he barks, I am happy to see him and give him a pat. Meanwhile,\nAlicia, a good friend of mine, has started coming over for a morning walk. Alicia rings the bell, Shadey\nbarks, and Alicia thinks, He\u2019ll jump on me and get me dirty. Dogs are unpredictable. Alicia feels slightly\nanxious, a bit physically tense, and not very happy to see Shadey. As a result, she tries to avoid Shadey.\nFigure 1.3 shows how Alicia\u2019s and my different thoughts can lead to very different feelings and\nbehavior.\nFeelings\nNina's Thoughts Behavior\nHappy\nShadey will Pats Shadey\nstop barking.\nPhysical Reactions\nHe is so cute.\nSituation Mildly excited\nShadey barks.\nFeelings\nAlicia's Thoughts Behavior\nAnxious and\nunhappy\nShadey will jump Tries to avoid\non me.

Shadey the dog barks.\nYOUR TURN!\nHow Thoughts Influence Feelings and Behavior\nTwo friends, Maria and Jane, work in the same company. They are both going to a conference, where\nthey won\u2019t know anyone. Maria is anxious and dreading the conference. When she imagines going, she\nthinks, This will be awful. No one will talk to me. Everyone will think I\u2019m stupid, and she gets a sick feeling\nin her stomach. Jane meanwhile thinks, This is a good opportunity to network and meet new people. It will\nbe fun to have something different to do. She is excited, full of energy, and can\u2019t wait for the conference to\nbegin. When we examine their thoughts, we can begin to understand why their reactions are so\ndifferent.\nWhen they get to the conference, Maria sits down in a corner of the room by herself, while Jane\nmingles with the other attendees. Complete figure 1.4 to see how Maria\u2019s and Jane\u2019s different thoughts\nin the same situation led to very different paths with different feelings, physical reactions, and behavior.\nYou can check your answers in the appendix.\n[Page 24]\nUse CBT Theory to Understand Your Clients 13\nsgnileeF\nroivaheB\nsthguohT\ns'airaM\nsnoitcaeR\nlacisyhP\nnoitautiS\nenaJ\ndna\nairaM\na\ndnetta\nsgnileeF\n.ecnerefnoc\nroivaheB\nsthguohT\ns'enaJ\nsnoitcaeR\nlacisyhP\n.ecnerefnoc\na\ndnetta\nenaJ\ndna\nairaM\n.4.1\nerugiF\n[Page 25]\n14 CBT Made Simple\nThis is the first additional practice exercise you will find at http://www.newharbinger.com\n/38501. You will find many more throughout the book.\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 1.1: What Is This Person Thinking?\nPractice understanding how thoughts can influence feelings.\nWhat do my dog Shadey and two colleagues attending a conference have to do with therapy?\nClients usually start therapy feeling overwhelmed and hopeless, with little understanding of the factors\nthat are causing and maintaining their difficulties. Separating thoughts from feelings, physical reactions, and behavior provides clients with a framework for understanding their problems. When clients\nunderstand their problems, they feel more in control and less hopeless. This is the first step in starting\nto change. Let\u2019s see how helping a client of mine, Alfred, identify the way his feelings are related to his\nthoughts, physical reactions, and behavior can help him understand his problems.\nAlfred is a seventeen-year-old boy who wants to be a car mechanic. He hates school but needs the\nhigh school credits to get into a car mechanic training program. He is in therapy because he is depressed\nand failing two of his subjects. He has an average IQ and no learning disabilities. He starts the session\nwith a big sigh and says, \u201cI am so down and depressed. I have a really hard math test tomorrow. It\u2019s too\nhard for me. I\u2019ve had a splitting headache all day. I\u2019m really anxious about this test. I haven\u2019t started\nstudying. I\u2019m going to fail anyhow. I\u2019m just going to go home and play computer games. I don\u2019t know\nwhat\u2019s wrong with me. Why don\u2019t I study?\u201d\nLet\u2019s look at figure 1.5 and see how using the four-factor model can help us understand Alfred\u2019s\nproblems. Imagine that his therapist says to him, \u201cSounds like you\u2019re having a tough time; let\u2019s make\nsure we understand what\u2019s going on for you. I want to start with separating out your thoughts from your\nfeelings, physical reactions, and behavior. Let\u2019s see if once we understand your reaction, we can understand why it\u2019s so hard for you to study.\u201d\nFeelings\nSituation Thoughts Behavior\nDown, depressed\nanxious\nTest is too hard\nMath test Does not study;\nfor me; I'm going\ntomorrow plays computer\nto fail anyhow\ngames\nPhysical Reaction\nHeadache\nFigure 1.5. Alfred has a math test tomorrow.\nWas it helpful to look at Alfred\u2019s reaction in terms of the four factors? Did identifying Alfred\u2019s\nthoughts help explain his feelings and behavior?\n[Page 26]\nUse CBT Theory to Understand Your Clients 15\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 1.2: Sharon Is Invited for Coffee\nPractice identifying the four factors.\nYOUR TURN!\nIdentify Clients\u2019 Thoughts, Feelings,\nPhysical Reactions, and Behavior\nSara is in therapy because she is not sure whether she wants to break up with her long-term boyfriend.\nShe complains that he does not respect her and takes her for granted. She starts the therapy session by\ntelling her therapist that she is very upset. Last night her boyfriend was thirty minutes late picking her\nup for dinner and had not bothered to let her know he would be late. When he finally arrived, he\nexplained casually he had been caught at work. Look at the following dialogue with a non-CBT therapist and see if you can identify the four factors in Sara\u2019s reaction.\nTherapist: W hat\u2019s it like for you when your boyfriend comes half an hour late without contacting you?\nSara: I am just so depressed at how he is treating me.\nTherapist: H ow did you react?\nSara: I gave him dirty looks and was cold all evening. What else can I do? I just feel so\nirritated and tense all the time.\nTherapist: I t is hard for you to know what else you could do.\nSara: That\u2019s right.\nTherapist: W hat is that like for you?\nSara: I hate it. He treats me as if he doesn\u2019t care about me. He takes me for granted.\nIt makes me feel worthless.\nIn this type of dialogue the client\u2019s thoughts, feelings, physical reactions, and behavior are a jumble;\nit is hard to know how best to continue therapy. Let\u2019s see what happens if you take the information\nfrom the above example and use the four-factor model as a structure to understand how Sara\u2019s thoughts\ninfluenced her feelings, physical reactions, and behavior. Complete the exercise below, then turn to the\nappendix to see how I completed the model.\nSituation:\nSara\u2019s Thoughts:\n[Page 27]\n16 CBT Made Simple\nSara\u2019s Feelings:\nSara\u2019s Physical Reactions:\nSara\u2019s Behavior:\nHow did identifying Sara\u2019s thoughts, feelings, physical reactions, and behavior help you understand\nher experience differently from when you read the therapy dialogue? Did writing make a difference?\nOften, helping clients identify their thoughts and feelings separately starts a process of self-reflection,\nwhich is the first step to change.\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 1.3: Roger Doesn\u2019t Want to Go to the Doctor\nPractice identifying the four factors from a therapy dialogue.\nAgenda Item #3: How Behaviors Maintain Problems\nTo understand how your clients\u2019 behaviors maintain their problems, you want to understand how\ntheir behavior influences their thoughts, feelings, and physical reactions. Start by looking at the consequences of your client\u2019s behavior. Let\u2019s examine first how the consequences of a behavior can reinforce\nyour client\u2019s thoughts, and second, how the consequences of a behavior can influence the situation so\nas to reinforce the client\u2019s original thoughts or interpretation.\nLet\u2019s go back to Alfred, my seventeen-year-old client in the earlier example with the math test.\nHere is a summary of Alfred\u2019s reaction using the four-factor model. Alfred thinks, The test is too hard\nfor me and I\u2019m going to fail anyhow. He feels anxious and he gets a headache. His behavior is to go home\nand play computer games.\nHow do the consequences of Alfred\u2019s behavior reinforce his thoughts and the situation? Alfred did\nnot study, he failed the test. When Alfred failed the test he thought, The test really was too hard for me\nsince I failed, and I was going to fail anyhow. Failing the test becomes evidence that the test is \u201ctoo hard.\u201d\nThus, the consequences of the behavior reinforce his original thoughts. Does this make sense so far? In\naddition, Alfred never gets a chance to test out his prediction, I\u2019m going to fail anyhow. Perhaps if Alfred\nhad studied, he would have passed, but he will never know. He will take his failure as evidence that he\nwould \u201cfail anyhow.\u201d\nNow, let\u2019s now look at how the consequences of Alfred\u2019s behavior impact the situation. Since\nAlfred failed the test, he probably does not understand the material. Since math concepts tend to build\non each other, this makes it more probable that he will fail, or do poorly, on the next test. Thus, his\nbehavior changes the actual situations in his life so that his negative thoughts are more likely to be true.\nFigure 1.6 shows how Alfred\u2019s behavior can reinforce his thoughts and influence the situation. Alfred\nis caught in what CBT therapists call a symptom maintenance cycle.\n[Page 28]\nUse CBT Theory to Understand Your Clients 17\nFeelings\nSituation Thoughts Down, depressed Behavior\nanxious\nTest is too hard Plays computer\nDifficult math test\nfor me; I'm going games\nto fail anyhow\nPhysical Reaction\nHeadache\nWhen fails, next test When fails, thoughts\nis harder are confirmed Consequences\nFails test\nFigure 1.6. Alfred\u2019s symptom maintenance cycle.\nYOUR TURN!\nMaria\u2019s Symptom Maintenance Cycle\nLet\u2019s return to the example of Maria, who had to attend a conference where she would not know\nanyone. Let\u2019s see how her behavior is maintaining her difficulties. I will fill in the first part for you. You\ncan see how I completed her symptom maintenance cycle in the appendix.\nMaria\u2019s Situation: Attending a conference where she does not know anyone\nMaria\u2019s Thoughts: This will be awful. No one will talk to me. Everyone will think I am stupid.\nMaria\u2019s Feelings: Anxious\nMaria\u2019s Physical Reaction: Sick stomach\nMaria\u2019s Behavior: Sits by herself in a corner\nConsequences:\nWhat are the consequences of Maria\u2019s behavior? Ask yourself: If she is sitting by herself, will people\ntalk to her? Do you think she will enjoy herself?\nHow do the consequences of her behavior reinforce her thoughts? (Hint: If she is sitting alone, what\nis the likelihood that people will talk to her? If she does not talk with the other people, will they have\na chance to see that she is not stupid?)\nHow do the consequences of her behavior influence the situation? (Hint: Maria started the conference not knowing anyone. If she sits in a corner, how many people will she know at the end of the\nconference?)\n[Page 29]\n18 CBT Made Simple\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 1.4: Lee Learns to Ask a Question\nPractice using a symptom maintenance cycle.\nAgenda Item #4: How Core Beliefs Influence Thoughts\nIn this book, we are going to focus on automatic thoughts, but I want you to understand core beliefs\ntoo, which underlie automatic thoughts. Core beliefs are stable, deeply held beliefs that cut across situations and influence automatic thoughts. (Some CBT books use the term schema; core beliefs and\nschemas are virtually identical.)\nThere are generally three types of core beliefs (Clark, Beck, & Alford, 1999):\nSimple rules about life. These are rules about how to manage in life or how the world works. They\nusually have very little influence on your client\u2019s emotional well-being. Examples might be:\n\u2022 Be polite to strangers.\n\u2022 To succeed in life, get a good education.\n\u2022 Always wear a life jacket in a boat.\nIntermediary beliefs and assumptions. These are rules for living that often take the form of if\u2026then\nstatements or unless I\u2026 statements. These rules play an important role in determining feelings and\nbehaviors. Examples might be:\n\u2022 Unless I am perfect, I will fail.\n\u2022 If I yell, then people will listen to me.\n\u2022 If people see the real me, then they will reject me.\nCore beliefs. These are deeply held beliefs about self, others, or the world that affect how people feel\nand behave in many different situations. They are absolute and general statements that are felt at a very\ndeep level and can be captured in a few words. Core beliefs can be adaptive or maladaptive, and, unlike\nautomatic thoughts, they can be hard to identify and modify. Examples might be:\n\u2022 Core beliefs about self: I am smart, I am lovable, I am selfish, I am incompetent, I am\nunlovable.\n\u2022 Core beliefs about others: Others are kind, others will take care of me, others are mean, others\nwill take advantage of me.\n\u2022 Core beliefs about the world: The world is just, the world is stable, the world is dangerous, the\nworld is unjust.\nAlthough an individual\u2019s core beliefs are influenced by his innate temperament, they tend to be\nformed mainly by early life experiences and are modified by the individual\u2019s later life experiences\n(Young, Klosko, & Weishaar, 2006). For example, do you remember Maria from the first YOUR TURN!\n[Page 30]\nUse CBT Theory to Understand Your Clients 19\nexercise? She was anxious about attending the conference. When Maria was in grade four, she had\nsome trouble in math and was badly bullied by a group of girls. Her classmates regularly called her\n\u201cstupid.\u201d All of the girls she previously played with refused to play with her, and school became a nightmare. She did not tell her parents until late in the year, and had no support from her parents or teachers. Let\u2019s look at how this experience affected her core beliefs.\nMaria\u2019s Core Beliefs:\n\u2022 Self: I am stupid and unlikable.\n\u2022 Others: People will be critical and mean to me.\n\u2022 World: The world is unpredictable.\nThe power of core beliefs is their capacity to influence how you react to a variety of different situations. For example, when Maria meets a new neighbor, she will likely think, We will not get along.\nWhen her supervisor does not comment on her last report, she thinks, He probably thought it was terrible. Her automatic thoughts in these situations are all influenced by her core beliefs. Now imagine\nthat Maria receives an email from the human relations department of her firm asking for a meeting.\nWhat are her likely thoughts? (a) I did something wrong, I will be punished, this is terrible, or (b) I wonder\nwhat they want, it will probably be fine, if there is a problem I can explain myself to them. Figure 1.7 is a\ndiagram of how core beliefs influence automatic thoughts.\nCore Beliefs\nSelf: I am stupid and unlikable.\nOthers: People will be critical and mean to me.\nWorld: The world is unpredictable.\nMeet new neighbor. Supervisor does not HR department asks\nThought: We will not comment on report. for meeting. Thought:\nget along; she will not Thought: He probably I did something wrong,\nlike me. thought it was terrible. I will be punished, this\nis terrible.\nFigure 1.7. Maria\u2019s core beliefs influence her automatic thoughts.\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 1.5: Understand Janice\u2019s Reactions\nPractice understanding the relationship between core beliefs and automatic thoughts.\n[Page 31]\n20 CBT Made Simple\nLet\u2019s look at the situation where Maria meets her new neighbor in more detail. When Maria thinks,\nWe will not get along; she will not like me, she is hesitant to reach out to her neighbor and tends to avoid\nany contact with her. Consequently, her neighbor thinks Maria is unfriendly and also avoids Maria.\nThe consequences of Maria\u2019s behavior reinforce her thoughts, which confirm her core beliefs. Figure\n1.8 shows how Maria is caught in a vicious cycle where the consequences of her behavior reinforce not\nonly her thoughts but also her core beliefs.\nCore Beliefs\nSelf: I am stupid and unlikable.\nOthers: People will be critical and mean to me.\nWorld: The world is unpredictable.\nConsequences reinforce\nthoughts and core belief Meets new neighbor. Thought: We\nwill not get along; she will not like me.\nConsequences Behavior\nMaria\u2019s neighbor thinks Maria avoids\nshe is unfriendly and her neighbor.\navoids Maria.\nFigure 1.8. Maria\u2019s vicious cycle also influences her core beliefs.\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 1.6: Understand Janice\u2019s Vicious Cycle and Core Beliefs\nPractice understanding how vicious cycles can involve core beliefs.\nClinical Implications. CBT therapists usually start with focusing on clients\u2019 automatic thoughts and\nbehavior as this teaches clients basic CBT skills and can lead to fairly rapid improvement in clients\u2019\nbehaviors and moods. Because core beliefs are connected to automatic thoughts, often as clients change\ntheir automatic thoughts and behavior, their core beliefs also start to change.\nIt is helpful to start hypothesizing about your client\u2019s core beliefs from the beginning of therapy.\nNoticing the type of situations that cause difficulty for your client together with noticing the pattern of\nyour client\u2019s automatic thoughts provides clues to his core beliefs.\n[Page 32]\nUse CBT Theory to Understand Your Clients 21\nClients either don\u2019t notice information that contradicts their core beliefs, or they minimize the\ninformation. How would you expect Maria to react when her neighbor says, \u201cI am so happy to see you\u201d?\nWould she think, She\u2019s just saying that to make me feel good, or would she think, She really likes me?\nHypothesizing about your client\u2019s core beliefs can help you notice what types of information your client\nis likely to ignore or minimize.\nHomework: Practice CBT\nAt the end of each chapter I list the additional exercises that are mentioned in the chapter and available on the website (http://www.newharbinger.com/38501). I also suggest exercises for homework that\nfocus on applying what you learned to your own life and therapy practice. When you learn a new\napproach, it is important to practice; otherwise, it never becomes part of your own therapy style. Doing\nthe homework is a key component to learning CBT.\nApply What You Learned to Clinical Examples\nComplete the following exercises.\nExercise 1.1: What Is This Person Thinking?\nExercise 1.2: Sharon Is Invited for Coffee\n\uf09d\nExercise 1.3: Roger Doesn\u2019t Want to Go to the Doctor\nExercise 1.4: Lee Learns to Ask a Question\nExercise 1.5: Understand Janice\u2019s Reactions\nExercise 1.6: Understand Janice\u2019s Vicious Cycle and Core Beliefs\nApply What You Learned to Your Own Life\nIt takes practice to become aware of our thoughts, feelings, physical reactions, and behavior. This\ncoming week, when you are having a strong negative emotional reaction, notice your thoughts and\nwrite them down. Then ask yourself if noticing your thoughts as separate from your feelings changed\nanything. What was it like to write down your thoughts and feelings?\nHomework Assignment #1\nUse the Four-Factor Model to Understand Your Own Situation\nOnce you have had some practice noticing your thoughts and feelings, try to use the whole four-factor\nmodel. Complete the four-factor model below for one situation in which you had a strong negative\n[Page 33]\n22 CBT Made Simple\nreaction. Write out your answers; it makes a difference. How did using the four-factor model affect your\nunderstanding or your own reaction?\nSituation:\nThoughts:\nFeelings:\nPhysical Reactions:\nBehavior:\nApply What You Learned to Your Therapy Practice\nLet\u2019s see if applying the four-factor model to your own clients can help you understand their problems differently.\nHomework Assignment #2\nUse the Four-Factor Model to Understand a Client\u2019s Situation\nThink of a situation involving a current client. Try to complete the four-factor model below using the\nsituation you selected. Don\u2019t gather additional information; use what you already know. Notice if you\nare missing information for one of the factors. How did using the four-factor model help you understand\nyour client differently?\nSituation:\nThoughts:\nFeelings:\nPhysical Reactions:\nBehavior:\n[Page 34]\nUse CBT Theory to Understand Your Clients 23\nLet\u2019s Review\nAt the end of a CBT session, the therapist and client spend a few moments reviewing what was covered\nin the session. Similarly, let\u2019s take a moment to review what we just covered. For each agenda item, try\nto answer the questions. If you are unsure of an answer, you can find it in that section of the chapter.\nAgenda Item #1: CBT building blocks: thoughts, feelings, physical reactions, and behavior\n\u2022 Why is it helpful to divide your client\u2019s reactions into thoughts, feelings, physical reactions, and\nbehavior?\nAgenda Item #2: How thoughts maintain problems\n\u2022 How do thoughts lead to feelings, physical reactions, and behavior?\nAgenda Item #3: How behaviors maintain problems\n\u2022 What do we mean by symptom maintenance cycles?\nAgenda Item #4: How core beliefs influence thoughts\n\u2022 What are core beliefs?\nWhat Was Important to You?\nThe more you can relate the material you have just read to your own life, the more you will\nremember. Take a moment to answer the following questions. They are an opportunity for you\nto reflect on the chapter and how it is relevant to your own practice.\nWhat idea(s) or concepts would you like to remember?\nWhat idea(s) or skill(s) would you like to apply to your own life?\nWhat would you like to try this coming week with a client? (Choose a specific client.)\nWhat was it like to review? Did it help consolidate what you learned?\n[Page 35]\nCHAPTER 2\nFocus on Your Clients\u2019\nProblems and Strengths\nLet\u2019s start with a check-in and review. In the last chapter we covered basic CBT theory, and we started\nusing the four-factor model. Remember, the four-factor model involves exploring your client\u2019s reaction\nto a situation by identifying thoughts, feelings, physical reactions, and behaviors. We also looked at how\nthoughts and behaviors can maintain problems. Did you try using the four-factor model? What did you\nnotice when you differentiated thoughts from feelings?\nIf you did not have a chance to use the four-factor model, try this exercise. Think of a situation in\nthe past few days where you had a strong negative emotional reaction. Imagine yourself back in that\nsituation. Now, try to identify your thoughts, feelings, physical reactions, and behavior. Afterwards,\ntake a moment to reflect on the experience. Did you learn anything about yourself?\nSet the Agenda\nIn this chapter, I want to focus on forming a good therapy relationship, understanding your clients\u2019\npresenting problems and strengths, and explaining CBT to your clients.\nAgenda Item #1: Develop a good therapeutic relationship.\nAgenda Item #2: Understand your client\u2019s presenting problems.\nAgenda Item #3: Meet Suzanne.\nAgenda Item #4: Understand your client\u2019s stressors and strengths.\nAgenda Item #5: Meet Raoul.\nAgenda Item #6: Understand your client\u2019s psychosocial history.\nAgenda Item #7: Explain CBT.\n[Page 36]\nFocus on Your Clients\u2019 Problems and Strengths 25\nWork the Agenda\nShortly, I\u2019ll introduce you to two clients, Suzanne and Raoul, whom we will work with throughout the\nbook as we learn and practice CBT skills. But first, let\u2019s start where all good therapy starts\u2014with the\ntherapeutic relationship.\nAgenda Item #1: Develop a Good Therapeutic Relationship\nFor all types of therapy, including CBT, a good therapeutic relationship predicts a positive outcome\n(Martin, Garske, & Davis, 2000; Norcross & Wampold, 2011). Effective therapy happens in the context\nof a supportive relationship where your client feels understood and accepted. As with any form of\ntherapy, when practicing CBT, it is important to be warm and nonjudgmental. You want to develop a\ncollaborative relationship with your client, working together to solve her problems. You bring your\nknowledge about psychology and CBT, and your client brings her knowledge about her own life and\nexperience.\nMultiple studies have demonstrated that empathy is a central component of any effective therapy\n(Norcross & Wampold, 2011). I would guess that you agree, but take a moment to think about how you\ndefine empathy. Usually, when I ask my students this question they answer, \u201cwalking in someone else\u2019s\nshoes\u201d or \u201cunderstanding someone else\u2019s feelings.\u201d My students always mention feelings; almost no one\nmentions thoughts. Understanding feelings is important, but understanding thoughts is just as important (Elliott, Bohart, Watson, & Greenberg, 2011).\nLet\u2019s consider an example. Sorena, your client, tells you that she feels sad and tired. She also tells\nyou that she thinks she is an inadequate parent and that her children don\u2019t respect or love her. If you\nwanted to be truly empathic, would you focus just on Sorena\u2019s feelings or also on her thoughts? It seems\nto me that using the four-factor model and asking about both feelings and thoughts increases an\nempathic connection.\nOver the years, some therapists have told me that they think CBT is a cold type of therapy because\nwe pay attention to thoughts. If you look at the previous example, what do you think? It seems to me\nthat thoughts are as private and emotional as feelings. It is important to remember that when you ask\nclients what they \u201cthink,\u201d you are asking them to reveal a very private part of themselves. In this book\nwe will focus on how to be a warm, empathic therapist while also using structured CBT interventions\n(Josefowitz & Myran, 2005).\nAgenda Item #2: Understand Your Client\u2019s\nPresenting Problems\nThere is an order to CBT therapy. While there is some flexibility, typically the following order is\nimplemented:\n\u2022 Explore your client\u2019s presenting problem and obtain an overview of her current life situation,\nincluding difficulties and strengths.\n\u2022 Take a psychosocial history.\n[Page 37]\n26 CBT Made Simple\n\u2022 Explain CBT in general and in particular the four-factor model.\n\u2022 Set goals for therapy.\n\u2022 Focus on helping your client change.\nIn the initial phase of therapy, you start to form a good relationship and at the same time get an\noverview of your client\u2019s problems and how they are affecting her life. You also want to obtain a sense\nof your client\u2019s strengths and how she has coped in the past.\nThere are three main steps to obtaining an initial understanding of your client\u2019s problems or why\nshe came to therapy:\n1. Ask your client about her problems and make a list.\n2. Explore how your client\u2019s problems are affecting her life and how she is coping.\n3. Collaboratively decide which problem(s) your client wants to start working on in therapy.\nAsk your client about her problems and make a list. CBT therapists usually start with \u201cHow can I\nhelp you?\u201d or \u201cTell me, what brings you to therapy?\u201d It is important for your client to explain her problems in her own words. Initially, I focus on listening, using summary statements to be sure I have understood, and then ask open questions. Open questions encourage exploration and are not answered with\njust one word. For example, \u201cDo you have a problem?\u201d is a closed question. The answer is yes or no.\n\u201cWhat kind of problem do you have?\u201d is an open question. One way to think about this stage is that\nwhen your client starts therapy, the picture is blurry. Good questions help you gradually focus and\nsharpen the picture so that it is crisp and bright, or at least clearer.\nAfter you have a general sense of your client\u2019s problems, it is helpful to make a list so that you can\nexplore her problems more fully, one at a time. Writing out a list gives the message that therapy will\naddress specific problems and not just be a place where she comes and talks in general terms. Making\na list also starts to give direction to therapy.\nI usually say, \u201cI am starting to have an idea of some of your concerns. I would like to make a list of\nyour problems to be sure we have covered everything.\u201d Most non-CBT therapists are not used to writing\nas part of therapy. Next time you have a new client, try writing out your client\u2019s problems and share the\nlist with your client. Pay attention to how making a written list affects therapy.\nExplore how your client\u2019s problems are affecting her life and how she is coping. Often clients\ndescribe general problems, such as difficulty with their marriage or feeling anxious. To understand how\na problem is affecting your client\u2019s life, you need to explore further. You will find the following list of\nquestions helpful. (You can download them in handout format at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.)\nQuestions to Explore Your Client\u2019s Problems\nQuestion 1: What are some examples of situations where this problem arises? When you have this\nproblem, what are your main thoughts, feelings, physical reactions, and behavior?\nI usually start with this question. Once you have examples of specific situations, the problem usually\nbecomes much more defined.\n[Page 38]\nFocus on Your Clients\u2019 Problems and Strengths 27\nQuestion 2: What is the worst part of the problem?\nIt is important to ask this question and not just assume that you know the answer. I am often surprised\nby my client\u2019s answer.\nQuestion 3: How is this problem affecting your life? What are some of the difficulties this problem has\ncreated for you? In particular, are there activities you have stopped doing or are avoiding because of the\nproblem? Are there activities you have started doing or are doing more of because of the problem?\nIf my client is avoiding specific activities, I follow up by asking what she thinks would happen if she did\nnot avoid them.\nQuestion 4: What have you done to try and cope with the problem? Have any of your coping methods\nhelped?\nYou want to know whether anything has helped, even a little, so that you can expand upon this coping\nstrategy later. In addition, you want to acknowledge and support any active attempt to cope with the\nproblem.\nQuestion 5: When did this problem start?\nSometimes a client can immediately identify a triggering situation. Sometimes she has not thought about\nwhether her difficulties were related to specific changes or events in her life. A series of relatively minor\nchanges, over a short period of time, can equal a lot of stress.\nYOUR TURN!\n\uf0b2\nPractice in Your Imagination: Use One of the Five Questions\nI want you to imagine using the questions we just covered. Sports psychologists have known for years\nthat imagining practicing a new skill significantly enhances skill development (Weinberg, 2008). It\nseems to me that if athletes can use imagery to practice, why not therapists?\nYou can do the exercise by reading along, but I think you will find the exercise more meaningful if\nyou listen to the guided audio file available at the website for this book.\nLook at Questions to Explore Your Client\u2019s Problems. Choose a question which you rarely or\nnever use. Now, choose a client with whom you want to try asking this question. Imagine yourself back in your office. Take a moment to look around; notice the sounds and smells of your\noffice. Now imagine yourself asking this question with your client. Now, imagine asking this\nquestion with a different client. Each time, imagine that your client responds positively.\nWrite down the question you choose, and try it with two clients this coming week.\n[Page 39]\n28 CBT Made Simple\nAgenda Item #3: Meet Suzanne\nThroughout this book we are going to follow two clients, Suzanne and Raoul. They are based on a\nnumber of my clients and the clients of students I have supervised or taught. I want to start with introducing you to Suzanne. We will meet Raoul later in the chapter.\nSuzanne is thirty-four and is married with two young children, Jennifer, age six, and Andrew, age\nfour. She is a fourth-grade teacher and her husband works in a local hardware store. Her husband was\nher high-school sweetheart, and she is still in love with him. They live in the suburbs of a medium-size\ncity. Her parents and her in-laws live nearby; she sees them regularly and they have a good\nrelationship.\nSuzanne\u2019s doctor referred her for therapy because she is always tired and feels chronically overwhelmed by the children, her job, and her other responsibilities. Her physical exam was normal, and\nher doctor thought it would be helpful for her to \u201ctalk to someone.\u201d Suzanne calls the therapist\u2019s office\nand makes an appointment.\nSuzanne is a small, thin woman who smiles timidly when she walks into her therapist\u2019s office for\nthe first time. She perches on the edge of the couch and looks nervously around. When Suzanne\u2019s\ntherapist asks, \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d she responds softly with, \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2026 I don\u2019t know even know\nwhere to start,\u201d and looks down. Her therapist gently asks, \u201cTell me what brings you here; I know it can\nbe hard to start.\u201d Suzanne explains she does not know what is wrong with her. She has a great house,\ngreat kids, a good job, and a great husband, but she is just so overwhelmed all the time that she isn\u2019t\nenjoying life anymore. She starts to cry and says she feels like she isn\u2019t coping. Her therapist asks\nSuzanne to tell her a bit more. Suzanne explains that she is always tired, cries over silly things, and\nquickly gets angry with the kids. She looks very sad and says, \u201cI\u2019m not even a good mother anymore.\u201d\nSuzanne explains that she used to like her job as a fourth-grade teacher, but she dreads going into work\nthese days. She is teaching at a new school, which is a thirty- to forty-minute commute. Her old school\nwas walking distance from home. She is often angry with her husband. He works long hours and she\nfeels she is expected to take care of the children and house without any appreciation from him. She is\nscared that he will leave her if she stays this depressed. She feels anxious all of the time. She has always\nbeen a shy person, but her anxiety is getting much worse; she worries over everything.\nLet\u2019s see how we can start to understand Suzanne\u2019s problems using Questions to Explore Your\nClient\u2019s Problems.\nTherapist: Sounds like a lot. I think it would help if we made a list of your problems so we can start\nto understand them one at a time.\nSuzanne\u2019s therapist\u2019s response is both empathic and structured. Suzanne was feeling overwhelmed; her\ntherapist thought that making a list might help her start to feel that her problems were more\nmanageable.\nSuzanne lists being tired all of the time, yelling at her children, not doing anything fun, hating\nwork, and wondering if teaching is the right job. These are all general problems, and we don\u2019t really\nunderstand how they are affecting her life.\nTherapist: I think it would be helpful to understand a bit more about what is happening with you.\nLet\u2019s pick one problem and look at it in more depth. Let\u2019s start with exploring what is the\nworst part of this problem for you. (Question 2)\n[Page 40]\nFocus on Your Clients\u2019 Problems and Strengths 29\nNote how Suzanne\u2019s therapist explains what she wants to do by saying she wants \u201cto understand a bit more\nabout what is happening with you.\u201d At the same time, she reinforces hope by saying \u201cit would be helpful.\u201d\nThis is a good example of combining the structure of CBT with creating a good therapy relationship and\ninstilling hope.\nSuzanne: I think the worst thing is that I\u2019m always yelling at my kids and feeling like I am not\ncoping.\nThis is a very general statement. You want a more specific idea of Suzanne\u2019s difficulties. Before looking at\nSuzanne\u2019s therapist\u2019s response, think about how you could ask Suzanne to identify specific situations that\nare difficult for her.\nTherapist: Could you give me some examples so I have a better idea of the situations that are difficult\nfor you? (Question 1)\nSuzanne: Sure, I used to come home and make dinner for the family, and then play with my kids.\nThese days just making dinner seems to take up all of my energy; I never seem to have time\nor energy to spend time with my children, and when I do, I am pretty irritated.\nAs a CBT therapist, you are using the four-factor model to think about your clients\u2019 problems. When\nSuzanne gave an example of a difficult situation, did she describe her thoughts, feelings, physical reaction,\nand behaviors?\nWe have an idea of Suzanne\u2019s feelings (overwhelmed and irritated/angry) and her physical reaction\n(tired); we don\u2019t know her behavior or her thoughts. She mentioned earlier the thought I am not even a\ngood mother anymore. You can guess that\u2019s what she is thinking about herself in these situations, but it\nis important to check.\nTherapist: Suzanne, when you are feeling overwhelmed and irritated, what are some of the thoughts\nthat are going through your mind? (Question 1)\nNotice that Suzanne\u2019s therapist linked her thoughts to her feelings.\nSuzanne: I\u2019m usually thinking that I am a terrible mother and the kids deserve better. But I am also\nthinking that I wish I could just go to bed and not have to take care of the kids.\nTry to think of an empathic comment that would summarize what Suzanne said and indicate that you had\nheard Suzanne\u2019s thoughts. How could you ask Suzanne about her behavior and how she is coping? Think\nof how you would respond before checking what Suzanne\u2019s therapist said.\nTherapist: Those sound like pretty difficult thoughts to be having. Lots of self-critical thoughts and\nthen wishing you could just go to bed and get away from it all. Tell me, how do you cope\nin these situations? (Question 4)\nSuzanne: I just try to control my anger and take care of the kids. But I am pretty short with them. I\nhave been trying to take it easy and go to bed early, to be less tired, but it hasn\u2019t helped.\nTherapist: Have you tried anything that has helped?\n[Page 41]\n30 CBT Made Simple\nSuzanne: No, not really.\nHow could you introduce Question 3?\nTherapist: I wonder if there are things you have stopped doing since you have been feeling so bad, or\nsituations you are avoiding?\nSuzanne: Well, I generally do less fun things with my husband and children. Lately I am just too\ntired.\nThis is a very general comment. How could you help Suzanne become more specific about what \u201cfun\nthings\u201d she is doing less of?\nTherapist: When you say you do less fun things with your husband and children, can you give me\nsome examples?\nSuzanne: I used to take my daughter, who is six, to a playgroup in the afternoon with some of my\nneighbors. I have a half day off from work each week. But I\u2019ve been too tired to do that.\nAlso my husband and I used to take the kids to the park on weekends, which was a fun\nfamily time; but I often send them over to my parents\u2019 so that I can nap, or my husband\ntakes them without me.\nWhen you look at Suzanne\u2019s response, is there anything Suzanne has been doing more of? Suzanne\u2019s therapist thought that she had been doing more resting and napping. This is a good place to ask about changes\nin alcohol consumption, drugs, and medication.\nHer therapist discovers that Suzanne has stopped doing most afterschool activities with her children as she is \u201ctoo tired\u201d and that she has also stopped seeing and talking with most of her girlfriends.\nShe and her husband have also stopped seeing many of their friends and family because Suzanne feels\nthat she is too tired. Suzanne\u2019s problems started when she changed schools. She is unhappy at her new\nschool, has made no friends, and feels like an outsider. Suzanne has not started consuming alcohol, nor\ndid she report abusing prescription or nonprescription medication.\nSuzanne\u2019s therapist suggested that they write down a preliminary list of the problems that Suzanne\nwould like to work on in therapy.\nSuzanne suggested the following problems:\n1. Not having any friends at my new school\n2. Yelling at my children and husband\n3. Being tired all of the time\n4. Not doing fun things with my husband and children\n5. Being depressed and anxious and just not enjoying life anymore\n6. Wondering if teaching is the right job for me\nThis is a long list; the therapist and Suzanne have to figure out where to start.\n[Page 42]\nFocus on Your Clients\u2019 Problems and Strengths 31\nCollaboratively decide which problem(s) your client wants to start working on in therapy. If you\nremember from earlier in the chapter, there are three main steps to obtaining an initial understanding\nof your client\u2019s problems. First, ask about your client\u2019s problems and make a list; second, explore how\nyour client\u2019s problems are affecting her life; and third, collaboratively decide which problem your client\nwants to start working on. We are now ready for the third step.\nSome clients come to therapy with one main problem, but most have a number of different problems. You and your client need to decide which problem to address first, or therapy can feel like wandering around without a focus. The easiest approach is to be direct and say, \u201cI think it\u2019s helpful to try and\naddress one problem at a time. When we look over your problem list, which problem would you like to\nstart with?\u201d You want to pick a problem where there is a good chance you can help your client fairly\nquickly and that will have an immediate impact on her life.\nMarsha Linehan (1993) suggested some very useful criteria for prioritizing your client\u2019s problems.\nFirst, if your client is actively suicidal, your first priority is to make sure that she is safe. Second, if your\nclient is behaving in a manner that is dangerous or that is likely to significantly interfere with her life,\nthese behaviors need to be addressed. Examples of these types of behavior include major substance\nabuse, missing work or school, and being involved in a physically or emotionally abusive relationship.\nIn addition, if a client regularly engages in behavior that interferes with therapy, for example, coming\nlate to therapy, insulting the therapist, or skipping sessions, these behaviors need to be addressed.\nIf we consider each of Suzanne\u2019s problems, the first four that she listed are more specific and concrete than being depressed and not enjoying life anymore or wondering whether teaching is the right\njob for her. The therapist explained to Suzanne that because the first four problems are more specific\nand concrete, she would want to start with one of these so she will be able to help Suzanne in a shorter\nperiod of time and with more focus to therapy. She then asked Suzanne which problem she wanted to\nstart with. Suzanne wanted to start with making friends at her new school and not doing any fun things\nwith her husband and children.\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 2.1: Meet John and Understand Your Client\u2019s Presenting Problem\nAgenda Item #4: Understand Your Client\u2019s Stressors\nand Strengths\nIn addition to understanding your client\u2019s presenting problems, you need to understand how these\nproblems fit into her overall life. You want a picture of her current life, how she is functioning, and any\nother stressors or difficulties in her life besides her presenting problem, as well as the positive supports\nin her life and her areas of strengths.\nYou can introduce this section by saying, \u201cI am starting to get an understanding of your problems.\nI think it would be helpful if I could also get a sense of other parts of your life.\u201d Notice that I explain\nwhat I will be doing and indicate that it will be helpful to my client.\nThe basic categories that I ask about are family, friends and social contacts, recreation and involvement in organizations outside of the home, work or school, health, and finances. Finances includes the\nability to budget, pay bills on time, and all that is involved in being financially responsible. When\n[Page 43]\n32 CBT Made Simple\nasking about health, if you did not already ask about alcohol and drug use, this is a good place to do so.\nI also ask about self-care, either under recreation or health. I want to know if my client is engaging in\nactivities that are nurturing for her and if she is participating in any regular exercise. In addition, I ask\nwhether over the past year or few years there have been any major changes in my client\u2019s life, or a\nnumber of small changes.\nUNDERSTAND YOUR CLIENT\u2019S STRESSORS\nLet\u2019s start by seeing what we already know about Suzanne\u2019s stressors or difficulties in each\ncategory.\nSuzanne\u2019s Difficulties or Stressors\nFamily \u2022 Often angry with children and husband\n\u2022 Believes she is no longer a good mother\n\u2022 Responsible for the children and home because husband works long hours\n\u2022 Frightened husband will leave her if she doesn\u2019t change her mood and\nbehavior\nFriends and \u2022 Unknown\nSocial Contacts\nRecreation & \u2022 Unknown\nOrganizations\nWork or School \u2022 Fourth-grade teacher who \u201cdreads\u201d work\nHealth \u2022 Always tired\n\u2022 Otherwise unknown\nFinances \u2022 Unknown\nChanges \u2022 Started teaching at a new school that is a 30- to 40-minute commute\nfrom home\n\u2022 Can no longer walk to work every day and instead has to drive\n\u2022 Used to do fun things with girlfriends and participate in afterschool\nactivities with children\n\u2022 Used to like her job\n[Page 44]\nFocus on Your Clients\u2019 Problems and Strengths 33\nWhen we use the table above, we can start to see areas where we need more information. Suzanne\u2019s\ntherapist continues to ask about her life. She learns that Suzanne has always been shy but has a small\ngroup of friends with whom she is close. However, recently she has been avoiding her friends, as she is\njust too tired to go out. Her husband is the main salary earner, and she feels guilty about asking him to\nhelp more in the home since she earns less than he does. She used to like work, but this year she\nchanged schools. She has had trouble fitting into the new school; she feels different from the other\nteachers, who seem to form a tight group. In her previous school she was active in the school play, but\nshe has been hesitant to volunteer for afterschool activities at her new school, where everyone seems to\nknow each other. She reported that apart from lack of energy and being tired, her health was good and\nshe had no problem with alcohol or drug use. She also indicated that generally, while they would like\nmore money, finances were not a major problem. Between work and taking care of the children, she has\nno time for hobbies or recreation, though she enjoyed doing the school play last year.\nSuzanne indicated that she had not experienced any major stressors or changes other than her new\njob in the past few years. However, her mother-in-law, who used to babysit the children, had some\nhealth problems and was no longer able to help. Her daughter has had chronic ear infections. Suzanne\noften had to take time off from work to care for her daughter and take her to the doctor. Although her\ndaughter is better, Suzanne is worried about the upcoming winter. Also, Suzanne\u2019s best friend, Genia,\nmoved away and she misses her. Suzanne was surprised at the amount of change in her life over the past\nfew years and was able to see that all these changes together had caused a lot of stress.\nLet\u2019s stop for a moment. At this point we have quite a bit of information. However, we forgot to\nnotice strengths and areas of resilience. This often happens; as therapists, we are so used to thinking\nabout our clients\u2019 problems that we sometimes forget to think about their strengths.\nUNDERSTAND YOUR CLIENT\u2019S STRENGTHS\nBefore you can help your client see her strengths, first you need to see her strengths. It sounds easy,\nbut it can be hard to see strengths. One way I use to recognize my client\u2019s strengths is to remember that\ngood things do not happen by magic. For example, a client of mine said her son \u201cwas lucky\u201d because he\nwas asked back for a full-time job after his internship. Stop for a moment\u2014from what you know of the\nworld, what needs to happen in order for a young man to be asked back for a full-time job after an\ninternship? Does a fairy godmother just come and say, \u201cHere is your job\u201d? Her son had to get to work\non time, work hard, do a good job, and probably be pleasant to work with. All of these characteristics\nare reflective of her son\u2019s strengths. Now, he also had to be lucky, but luck is rarely enough.\nHere are some questions to help you think about your clients\u2019 strengths based on the work by\nChristine Padesky and Kathleen Mooney (2012). You can download these questions in handout form\n(Questions to Explore Strengths) at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\n\u2022 Are there any areas of your client\u2019s life that are going well, or any areas where your client has\npersevered in the face of difficulties or adversity? I do not mean just overcoming unusual challenges, but also being able to maintain a routine. For example, Suzanne gets up on time every day,\ngets her children dressed, gets to work, and has dinner ready for her family. This takes thought, care,\norganization, and perseverance; it doesn\u2019t just happen by magic. It is important to recognize strengths\ninvolved in accomplishing everyday activities. It can also be helpful to examine strategies people use\nto persevere in everyday activities.\n[Page 45]\n34 CBT Made Simple\n\u2022 Has your client been able to accomplish developmental tasks? For example, has your client been\nable to pass school grades, develop friendships, participate on sports teams, or have a steady job?\nThese accomplishments suggest that your client was able to keep commitments, learn new information, and have positive relationships with other people.\n\u2022 Does your client have a responsible and caring relationship with either a person or an animal?\nCaring relationships involve commitment and putting aside one\u2019s own needs.\n\u2022 Is your client acting according to her values or goals? Acting according to values and goals can be\ndifficult and often involves putting aside what you immediately want to do in favor of long-term goals.\n\u2022 Is your client accomplished or competent in a specific area? People often have pockets of achievements and skills. Being competent in a particular area does not have to be a huge achievement; it\ncould be that you are the person who always makes the birthday cakes, or the person your friends\nturn to for computer help. Frequently the coping mechanisms that people have developed to succeed\nin these areas can be transferred to other areas of their lives.\nLet\u2019s think about Suzanne and see how we would fill in the different categories for both her stressors and her strengths. You can download a Identify a Client\u2019s Stressors and Strengths worksheet at\nhttp://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\nSuzanne\u2019s Stressors and Strengths\nDifficulties or Stressors Strengths or Areas of Resilience\nFamily \u2022 Often angry with children and \u2022 Stable, long-term marriage\nhusband\n\u2022 Caring parent\n\u2022 Believes she\u2019s no longer a good\n\u2022 Previously engaged in children\u2019s\nmother\nactivities\n\u2022 Husband works long hours\n\u2022 Maintains household routines\n\u2022 Mainly responsible for children\n\u2022 Provides stable home for family, last\nand home\nyear able to care for sick child\n\u2022 Parents live nearby, good relationship\n\u2022 In-laws live nearby, good relationship\nFriends and \u2022 Shy \u2022 Small group of close, long-term\nSocial Contacts friends\n\u2022 Currently avoiding friends\nRecreation & \u2022 No hobbies \u2022 Enjoyed organizing school play last\nOrganizations year\n[Page 46]\nFocus on Your Clients\u2019 Problems and Strengths 35\nDifficulties or Stressors Strengths or Areas of Resilience\nWork or \u2022 Dreading work \u2022 Grade four teacher (indicates\nSchool completed undergraduate and\n\u2022 New school, avoiding interaction\ngraduate training)\nwith other teachers\n\u2022 Previously enjoyed work\n\u2022 Avoiding afterschool activities\n\u2022 Enjoyed colleagues at previous job\n\u2022 Participated in afterschool activities\n(school play)\nHealth \u2022 Daughter has history of ear \u2022 Own health is good\ninfections, not currently a\n\u2022 Does not use alcohol or drugs as\nproblem\ncoping mechanism\n\u2022 Daughter\u2019s ear difficulties have\nresolved\nFinances \u2022 Earns less than her husband and \u2022 Earns a regular salary\nconsequently feels guilty about\n\u2022 Has a job with benefits\nasking for help\n\u2022 No particular financial stress\nChanges \u2022 Change in school \u2022 Despite all of the changes\nmaintaining a stable home\n\u2022 Longer commute\n\u2022 Responsible teacher\n\u2022 Mother-in-law no longer babysits\n\u2022 Organized babysitting\n\u2022 Some health problems with her\ndaughter \u2022 Recognized difficulties and coming\nfor therapy\n\u2022 Genia, her best friend, moved\naway\nOften in the beginning of therapy, clients are very hesitant to notice their strengths. In the next\nfew chapters we\u2019re going to talk more about how to use your clients\u2019 strengths. Before we continue, ask\nyourself: how did thinking about Suzanne\u2019s problems using the different categories affect your understanding of her problems and strengths? What was it like to consciously notice her strengths?\n[Page 47]\n36 CBT Made Simple\nAgenda Item #5: Meet Raoul\nIt\u2019s now time to meet the second client we will be following throughout the book, Raoul.\nRaoul is fifty-eight and lives with his wife in a medium-size city. He has three grown children who\nall live about an hour\u2019s drive away. For the past twenty years he has worked at the same job as a government employee in the tax department. His daughter was home for a visit and noticed that he did not\nseem like himself. He told her that he was not sleeping well and was pretty anxious about work. She\nsuggested that he see a therapist, and he reluctantly agreed. His daughter called and made an appointment for him.\nRaoul introduced himself to his therapist with a formal handshake and gave his full name. He\nwalked slowly into the room and lowered himself onto the couch with effort. He gave a small smile and\nsaid it was his daughter\u2019s idea that he come. His therapist asked how she could help him. Raoul explained\nthat in the past he has had periods when he felt depressed, but he was always able to get over them on\nhis own. Lately he was depressed again, and things were not going well at work. To better understand\nRaoul\u2019s concerns, his therapist used Questions to Explore Your Client\u2019s Problems. Raoul said that his\nproblems had started when a younger man was promoted to the job that should have been his. He\nexplained in some detail how unfair the hiring process had been. Since then, he said, he has been\nhaving difficulty concentrating at work, and for the first time ever, he recently received a poor work\nevaluation. He is worried about the work evaluation and what the consequences would be if he receives\nanother one. He stressed that for the past twenty years he has only received good year-end\nevaluations.\nSince the poor work evaluation there has been some tension with his boss. His therapist asked for\nexamples of situations with his boss that were difficult, or projects where he was having difficulty concentrating. Raoul had trouble giving specific examples of tension with his boss but was able to list the\nprojects on which he was procrastinating.\nRaoul\u2019s therapist asked about other aspects of his life, but he was very hesitant to talk about anything but his problems at work. Everything else was \u201cfine.\u201d He reported that he and his wife \u201chave no\nproblems.\u201d He occasionally has a couple of beers when he goes out, but otherwise doesn\u2019t drink. He said\nhis health was good. He told his therapist that he was usually shy, but for the past five years he has been\npart of a bowling league, which his wife had encouraged him to join. His therapist assumed that as\ntherapy progressed and Raoul learned to trust her, she would find out more about the other areas of his\nlife. For the time being, she thought it would be helpful to focus on his work difficulties.\nRaoul and his therapist made the following list of problems he wanted to work on:\n1. Feeling anxious\n2. Not completing projects on time\n3. Sleeping poorly\n4. Tension with his boss\n[Page 48]\nFocus on Your Clients\u2019 Problems and Strengths 37\nYOUR TURN!\nRaoul\u2019s Stressors and Strengths\nConsider the information you already have about Raoul in relation to his stressors and strengths.

Even if you only take a brief history, it\u2019s helpful to place your client\u2019s current problems in the\noverall history of her life, being sure to also listen for her strengths and areas of resilience.\nGenerally, when taking a history you are trying to figure out how your clients\u2019 past experiences\nrelate to their current problems. As a CBT therapist, I take a psychosocial history in a similar manner\nas any other therapist; however, there are two main areas that I emphasize and that might be slightly\ndifferent from non-CBT therapists. First, therapists usually ask clients how they felt about a given event\nin their past; I make sure that I also ask what it meant to them, or what their thoughts were at the time.\nI am particularly interested in the messages my client learned about herself, others, and the future.\nSome of the questions I ask are:\n\u2022 How did you understand this event?\n\u2022 How did you explain this event to yourself?\n\u2022 What did this event mean about you?\n\u2022 What did this event mean about other people?\n\u2022 What did this event mean about your future?\nFor example, a client of mine, Lisa, failed grade six when her parents divorced, and she went to live\nwith her grandparents. When I asked if she thought that failing grade six meant anything about her,\nshe replied, \u201cI am not very smart, and without my parents\u2019 help I couldn\u2019t manage.\u201d This is important\ninformation. Another client of mine, Michael, was sexually abused by his uncle over a period of three\nyears, starting when he was eight years old. When I asked him how he understood the sexual abuse, he\nexplained that he thought it happened because something was wrong with him and that he can\u2019t trust\nanyone; he then added that bad things are always going to happen to him in the future. Early messages\nsuch as these will influence how your client feels, thinks, and behaves in her current life.\nThe second area I emphasize is listening for strengths and evidence that my client is competent\nand lovable. I am starting to gather evidence that I can use later to counter any negative beliefs.\nAlthough it is not a hard-and-fast rule, I usually don\u2019t share my perception of my client\u2019s strengths this\nearly in therapy. I have found that if I share my perception of strengths too early, it is just rejected. For\nexample, my client Lisa, who failed a grade the year her parents divorced, mentioned that she passed\nthe next year and completed nursing training. She was also one of the few students in her class to be\noffered a job immediately upon graduating. I kept that information in my back pocket, so that down the\n[Page 50]\nFocus on Your Clients\u2019 Problems and Strengths 39\nroad when we start to explore her belief that she is not smart and can only manage with her parents\u2019\nhelp, I know that I have some evidence to counter that belief.\nAgenda Item #7: Explain CBT\nAfter you have an understanding of your client\u2019s problems and have taken a history, it is time to\nexplain how CBT works. Here is an example of how I might explain CBT. (A copy of Explain CBT to\nYour Client is available at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.)\nI have heard a bit about your problems and how they are affecting your life. I want to tell you how\nI work. I use a CBT model. CBT is a goal-oriented form of therapy. I am going to ask you to set\nsome goals for yourself in therapy and together we are going to focus on working toward them.\nTherapy will involve us first understanding your problems by identifying your thoughts,\nfeelings, physical reactions, and behavior and how they fit together. We will then start to help\nyou make some changes by focusing on one of these factors at a time. Since they are all related,\na change in one factor will influence all of the other factors.\nAt this point I often take a situation from my client\u2019s life and together we explore her thoughts,\nfeelings, physical reactions, and behavior. For example, in Raoul\u2019s case we might pick his discomfort\nwhen he has to interact with his colleagues at work. You do not want to choose a situation in which\nyour client has a very strong emotional reaction, as she will be too overwhelmed to listen to you and\napply the four-factor model. After exploring a situation using the four-factor model, ask if this makes\nsense to your client.\nIf you are working with children or teens, there are many wonderful games you can use to explain\nhow thoughts can influence feelings, physical reactions, and behavior (see, for example, Kendall,\nChoudhury, Hudson, & Webb, 2002; Stallard, 2005).\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 2.2: Meet Charlotte and Explain CBT\nHomework: Practice CBT\nBefore continuing with the next chapter, take some time to try the homework.\nApply What You Learned to Clinical Examples\nComplete the following exercise.\n\uf09d\nExercise 2.1: Ruda Attends Playgroup\nApply What You Learned to Your Own Life\nTry looking at your life in terms of your own stressors and strengths.\n[Page 51]\n40 CBT Made Simple\nHomework Assignment #1\nExplore Your Own Stressors and Strengths\nUse the table below to write down your stressors and strengths.

(Choose a specific client.)\n[Page 56]\nCHAPTER 3\nDevelop Goals for Therapy\nIn chapter 2 we focused on assessing your client\u2019s problems and strengths and on how to explain CBT.\nDid you try using Questions to Explore Your Client\u2019s Problems? Did you see your client\u2019s strengths differently after using any of these questions? I am curious whether you have started noticing your own\nthoughts. Has this made a difference in your life?\nWhen clients complete their homework, therapy is more effective and clients are more likely to\nmake real changes in their lives (Rees, McEvoy, & Nathan, 2005). Similarly, the extent to which you\nincorporate CBT into your own work will depend on how much you use the material in the book and\npractice. The homework at the end of each chapter is simply a structure for encouraging you to\npractice.\nIf you did not have a chance to do the homework from chapter 2, try to identify what factors got in\nthe way. Maybe you did not see any clients, or you were particularly busy. Sometimes therapists\u2019 thoughts\nget in the way of trying the homework with their clients. Did you have any of the following thoughts?\n\u2022 I don\u2019t need to do the homework, or I already understand the material.\n\u2022 The homework is not relevant to my clients, or if I try the CBT homework, my clients will react\nnegatively.\n\u2022 I will feel awkward doing the homework.\nDid any of these thoughts stop you from doing the homework and practicing your CBT skills? Did\nyou have other thoughts that got in the way of practicing? The reality is that you won\u2019t know whether\ndoing the homework is helpful unless you try. What if you were surprised and the homework really\nhelped? If you are worried about feeling awkward the first time you try an intervention, you are right;\nyou probably will feel uncomfortable because you are doing something new. I would guess that the first\ntime you tried any new skill you felt awkward. What would your life be like if you gave up whenever you\nfelt awkward?\nWhat would help you complete the homework for this chapter? Remember, the more you practice,\nthe easier it will be. If you did not do the homework from chapter 2, before starting this chapter, try\nthese two exercises:\n[Page 57]\n46 CBT Made Simple\n1. Think of a client with whom you are currently working. Try to think of both the stressors and\nthe strengths in his or her life. Look at Questions to Explore Strengths from chapter 2 for ideas\nof good questions to ask yourself to assess his or her strengths.\n2. If you have not started noticing your own thoughts, choose a recent situation in which you had\na moderate to strong emotional reaction. Take a moment to remember your thoughts at the\ntime. Try to write them down. How did noticing your thoughts affect your reaction?\nSet the Agenda\nCBT is an active form of therapy where the therapist and client set goals in the beginning of therapy\nand work toward these goals.\nAgenda Item #1: Set goals.\nAgenda Item #2: Develop specific, measurable goals.\nAgenda Item #3: Which goal do I focus on first?\nWork the Agenda\nGoals are different from problems. Problems describe what is wrong in your client\u2019s life. Goals are how\nyour client would like his life to be different, or what he would like to work toward. Setting effective\ngoals is a key element in CBT.\nAgenda Item #1: Set Goals\nIt is important that the therapist and client agree on the goals they are going to work on, or the\nsessions will tend to wander and feel as though nothing is getting accomplished. In addition, the\ntherapy relationship is strengthened when your client feels that you understand his goals and that\ntherapy is going to focus on those goals that are important to him.\nHaving goals in therapy is similar to starting out on a road trip. If someone asks me which road I\nwant to take, I have to first know where I want to end up. The road I would choose to get to Toronto\nis different from the road to Detroit. The more specific and clear the goal, the more I can plan how to\nget there. Goals give direction to therapy.\nClear Goals \uf05a Focused Therapy \uf05a Effective Therapy and Satisfied Clients\n[Page 58]\nDevelop Goals for Therapy 47\nWHAT IF MY CLIENT HAS MORE THAN ONE PROBLEM?\nIf a client identified two problems, you would most likely set goals for both problems and then focus\non the one he identified as his first priority. However, clients often have multiple problems. In this case,\nyou and your client need to pick one or two problems that he wants to work on first and develop goals\nfor those problems. Later in therapy, when the client is ready to start working on a new problem, you\nwould develop goals for the new problem. Often as therapy progresses, goals change.\nI encourage my clients to write down their goals. It makes their goals more concrete, and it gives us\na written document to refer back to. Most importantly, research indicates that setting goals early in\ntherapy significantly increases client satisfaction and the likelihood of a positive outcome (Safran &\nWallner, 1991).\nEXPLAIN GOAL SETTING\nBelow are some suggestions for how to introduce goal setting with new clients as well as current\nclients with whom you have been working for some time but had never set goals. You can download a\nhandout with these prompts (Explain Goal Setting) at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\nWhen explaining setting goals to a new client, you might start with the following:\nWhat I would like to do next is spend some time exploring your goals for therapy. I find that\nhaving clear goals gives therapy a sense of direction. I would like to start with identifying goals\nfor the first problem you said you would like to work on.\nThe explanation would start off differently for a current client with whom you had not set goals at\nthe beginning of therapy:\nI have been thinking about our sessions. At this point, I think it would be helpful for us to\nspend some time thinking about your goals, and what you would like our future sessions to\nfocus on. Setting goals can be helpful in giving therapy a sense of direction.\nBut from that point on, the explanation would be the same with both clients:\nI also want to spend some time making your goals as specific as we can, as I find the more\nspecific the goal, the more helpful it is. Specific goals can also help us measure whether therapy\nis working for you. As we talk about each goal, I would like to write it down. Would that be\nokay with you?\nYOUR TURN!\n\uf0b2\nPractice in Your Imagination: Explain Setting Goals\nI am going to ask you to imagine explaining goal setting first with a new client and then with a current\nclient. Before you start this exercise, rate from 1 to 10 how comfortable you feel introducing setting\ngoals with your clients, with 1 being very comfortable and 10 being very uncomfortable. At the end of\nthe exercise, rate your level of comfort again to see whether it changed. Now, let\u2019s try the exercise.\n[Page 59]\n48 CBT Made Simple\nPractice with a new client. Imagine yourself in your office with a new client. Take a moment\nto look around; notice the sounds and smells of your office. Now, imagine that you have just\ngone over your client\u2019s problems and you want to introduce goal setting. Read over how I suggested explaining goal setting while imagining yourself saying the words. You can also use your\nown phrases. Really hear and feel yourself explaining goal setting. Now imagine explaining goal\nsetting two more times with the same client. Each time imagine that your client responds\npositively.\nPractice with a current client. Choose a current client who you think would benefit from\nsetting goals, and who you also think would like the approach. Try to get a picture of him or her\nin your mind. Now imagine yourself in your office. Read over how I suggest explaining goals\nwith a current client while imagining yourself saying the words. You can also use your own\nphrases. Now imagine explaining goal setting two more times more with the same client. Each\ntime imagine that your client responds positively.\nAgenda Item #2: Develop Specific, Measurable Goals\nOnce you have introduced goal setting, you need to help your client develop more specific goals.\nThe more specific and clear the goal, the more helpful it is. However, what do we mean by specific,\nmeasurable goals?\nWHAT ARE SPECIFIC AND MEASURABLE GOALS?\nClients often start with very general goals, such as \u201cI would like to be less depressed [or less\nanxious],\u201d \u201cI would like to have better self-esteem,\u201d or \u201cI would like to have a better relationship with\nmy partner.\u201d The problem with these general goals is that you don\u2019t have a specific idea of how your\nclient wants his life to be different, nor does your client have any way of knowing whether he is on his\nway to achieving his goals. Goals that are specific and measurable give therapy a direction and provide\na yardstick for measuring whether therapy is on the right track. The easiest way to understand the difference between general and specific goals is to look at some examples.\n[Page 60]\nDevelop Goals for Therapy 49\nExamples of Goals\nGeneral Goals Specific, Measurable Goals\nBe more assertive. \u2022 Talk to my partner about some of my concerns about our relationship.\n\u2022 Set more limits with my boss (e.g., tell my boss that I can\u2019t take on new\nclients; ask my boss not to regularly call me on weekends or evenings).\n\u2022 Express my opinion when I am out with friends.\nBe less anxious. \u2022 Give a presentation at work.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t check on my kids as much (e.g., don\u2019t phone them on their cells if\nthey are 10 minutes late, but wait until they are half an hour late; only\nask once a night whether their homework is done).\n\u2022 Don\u2019t blow up over little things, like my husband forgetting to pack the\nchildren\u2019s lunch.\nYOUR TURN!\nIdentify Specify, Measureable Goals\nAt first the difference between a general goal and a specific, measurable goal can be hard to identify.\nLook at the goals below and decide how you would rate them. You can find my answers in the\nappendix.\n[Page 61]\n50 CBT Made Simple\nAssess Whether the Goal Is General\nor Specific and Measurable\nGoals Is This Goal General or\nSpecific and Measurable?\nTalk to my boss about getting paid for working overtime\nBe less demanding of my friends\nStop smoking by the end of the month\nTake better care of my health\nGet along better with my parents\nDo a pleasant activity with my partner on a weekly basis\nLearn better parent management skills for when my eight-yearold has a temper tantrum\nLet\u2019s look at two of the above goals in detail. The goal \u201ctalk to my boss about getting paid for\nworking overtime\u201d is a specific goal. We know exactly what behavior the client wants to do and we can\nmeasure whether he was able to do the behavior. The goal \u201cbe less demanding of my friends\u201d is a\ngeneral goal. Since we don\u2019t know what specific thoughts, feelings, physical reactions, or behaviors the\nclient would like to increase or decrease, we will have no way of knowing whether the client was successful in working toward this goal.\n[Page 62]\nDevelop Goals for Therapy 51\nHELP YOUR CLIENT DEVELOP SPECIFIC AND MEASURABLE GOALS\nIt can be challenging to move your client from general goals to more specific goals. Below are some\nquestions that can help. You can download them in handout form (Questions to Develop Helpful\nGoals) at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501. You can substitute one of your client\u2019s general goals for\n\u201cless depressed.\u201d\nQuestion 1: Are there specific situations that you would like to be handling differently? How\nwould you like to behave in these situations?\nQuestion 2: If you met your goal (e.g., to be less depressed), what would you be doing differently?\nOr how would you be reacting to situations differently?\nQuestion 3: If you met your goal (e.g., to be less depressed), how do you think your life would be\ndifferent?\nA client of mine, Barbara, came to therapy because of low self-esteem and \u201cwanting to like myself\nmore.\u201d When I asked, \u201cIf you liked yourself more, what would you do differently?\u201d she paused and\nresponded, \u201cI have never thought about that.\u201d She was able to list a number of specific issues, including\napplying for a promotion, not saying yes to her girlfriends in situations where she thought they were\ntaking advantage of her, and standing up to her mother. We explored each goal. At the end she turned\nto me and commented, \u201cYou really heard me. I feel that we have something specific to work toward.\u201d\nWhen developing specific goals, you don\u2019t want to be rigid. If your client wants to keep a general\ngoal that is meaningful to him, I would keep it, but try to add some more specific goals to guide therapy.\nRAOUL\u2019S GOALS BECOME MORE SPECIFIC\nOne of Raoul\u2019s initial goals was to be less anxious. This is a good general goal. Let\u2019s see how Raoul\u2019s\ntherapist uses Questions to Develop Helpful Goals.\nTherapist: Being less anxious is a good general goal, and a good place to start. I think it would be\nhelpful if you could be a bit more specific or concrete.\nRaoul: What do you mean?\nTake a moment and think about how you could you use Question 1 to make Raoul\u2019s goals more\nspecific.\nTherapist: I think it would be helpful to think of some specific ways that we could know you were on\nyour way to achieving your goal. For example, are there any particular situations where you\nwould like to be less anxious? (Question 1)\nRaoul: I guess at work, I am just really stressed.\nRaoul\u2019s goals are starting to be more focused, but we still do not have specific, measurable goals. How\ncould you use Question 2 to make Raoul\u2019s goals more specific?\n[Page 63]\n52 CBT Made Simple\nTherapist: If you were less anxious about work, I am wondering what you would be doing differently?\n(Question 2)\nRaoul: Mainly I wouldn\u2019t procrastinate over my big projects.\nRaoul is starting to be more specific. Take a moment to think about how you could use what he just said\nand turn it into a goal.\nTherapist: Might one goal be to stop procrastinating on your big projects?\nBecause Raoul did not explicitly state this as a goal, his therapist used the term \u201cmight\u201d when she turned\nRaoul\u2019s words into a goal. Using \u201cmight\u201d permits Raoul to disagree with his therapist.\nRaoul: Definitely.\nRaoul has made the goal more specific, but it would still be hard to measure. How could you use Question\n2 to make Raoul\u2019s goals more measurable?\nTherapist: If you stopped procrastinating, what would you like to do differently? (Question 2)\nRaoul: I would stop avoiding my colleagues on the project, get down to work, and talk to my boss\nabout the project.\nTherapist: It sounds like some of your goals might be to stop avoiding your colleagues, talk to your\nboss about the project, and get down to work.\nRaoul: Yeah, those would be good goals. I am not sure that I want to talk to my boss, but it would\nbe good to start the project.\nTherapist: It seems that a first goal might be to contact your colleagues and start work on the project,\nand then a longer-term goal might be to talk to your boss. Does that sound right?\nThe therapist realized that talking to the boss might not be Raoul\u2019s goal at the moment. The therapist\nwondered whether breaking the goals down into immediate and longer-term goals was more in line with\nwhat Raoul wanted.\nRaoul: (looking a bit more energetic) Yes, I think that would be very helpful.\nTherapist: Those are good goals. Let\u2019s write down the goals we have talked about so far and then see\nwhether there are any other ones. When you think about what we just talked about\u2014how\nwould you write out the goals?\nNotice that the therapist gives Raoul positive reinforcement for developing good goals.\nThe therapist and Raoul continue to explore his general goal \u201cbe less anxious at work.\u201d They\ndevelop the following list of specific goals:\n[Page 64]\nDevelop Goals for Therapy 53\nRaoul\u2019s Goals:\n\u2022 Cope better at work, particularly concentrate on my work and get my projects done on time.\n\u2022 Socialize with people at work the way I used to. This includes talking to people, having lunch\nin the lunchroom, going out for lunch, and chatting in the hallways.\n\u2022 Not get anxious every time the boss talks to me.\n\u2022 Start to like work again.\nYou will notice that some of Raoul\u2019s goals are very specific and measurable, for example, \u201cget my\nprojects done on time.\u201d Some of the goals are still fairly general, for example, \u201cstart to like work again.\u201d\nThe therapist thought they had made a good start and did not want to push developing specific goals\ntoo much, as they were just forming a relationship. The specific goals could be used immediately to give\ndirection to therapy, and the more general goals could be worked on later in therapy.\nYOUR TURN!\nHelp Suzanne Make Her Goals More Specific\nImagine that you have just introduced goal setting to Suzanne. Try to help Suzanne set specific goals\nthat can be measured.\nSuzanne: Well, to start, my main goal is to be less depressed.\nLook at the three possible responses below and pick the one that will help Suzanne develop a more\nspecific goal:\n1. I am so glad you are willing to work on your depression. What could you do to be less depressed?\n2. I hear how down you are feeling. You have a lot going on in your life. I am impressed that you\ncame for help. It is an important first step.\n3. That sounds like an excellent goal. It is pretty broad. If you were less depressed, how do you\nthink your life would be different?\nResponse #3 is the most likely to help Suzanne develop a specific goal and to start thinking about what\nshe would like to be different in her life. Response #1 starts to problem solve. This is too early in\ntherapy. Response #2 is a supportive comment, but it does not help Suzanne become more specific.\nTherapist: T hat sounds like an excellent goal. It is pretty broad. If you were less depressed,\nhow do you think your life would be different?\nSuzanne: Well, I would go out more for sure and not just want to stay home all the time.\n[Page 65]\n54 CBT Made Simple\nAsk yourself whether \u201cgo out more and not want to stay home all the time\u201d is specific enough. Look\nat the three possible responses below and pick the one you think will help Suzanne be more specific.\n1. I hear you would like to go out more. Did you used to go out more? What are some of the things\nthat are in the way of you going out more now?\n2. If you were to go out more, what are some of the things that you would like to do?\n3. I hear you would like to go out more. Can you tell me more about that?\nResponse #2 is most likely to focus the client on identifying specific activities she would be doing.\nResponse #1 starts a problem-solving process without being clear what \u201cgoing out more\u201d refers to.\nResponse #3 is too vague. You might get helpful information, but Suzanne may also talk about being\ndepressed in a general manner.\nTherapist: If you were to go out more, what are some of the things that you would like to do?\nSuzanne: W ell, for sure taking my kids to some of their activities, probably seeing friends,\nmaybe going out with my husband.\nSuzanne and her therapist continue to explore her goals and what might be some good indicators\nthat she is on the path to feeling less depressed. Here are the goals that Suzanne and her therapist\ndeveloped:\nSuzanne\u2019s Goals:\n\u2022 Fit into the new school. Try to make friends with the other teachers and join some of the\nextracurricular activities.\n\u2022 Not be so overwhelmed, but feel I am managing more; better morning and afternoon routine.\n\u2022 Not yell at the kids so much and play with the kids more.\n\u2022 Have good times with my husband and not be so angry all of the time.\n\u2022 Reconnect with my friends.\n\u2022 Enjoy my husband and children, start to do some fun things with them.\n\u2022 Have more energy, not be tired all of the time. (As part of this goal Suzanne agreed to look\nat lifestyle issues. Depending on the client, this might include smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, diet, and sleep hygiene.)\nWhen you look at Suzanne\u2019s goals, you will see that some are still very vague, such as \u201chave more\nenergy\u201d; however, some are concrete and specific. You\u2019ll also notice that some of the goals are stated in\nthe negative and involve what Suzanne wants to stop doing, for example, not be angry all of the time,\nand some are positive goals, or what she wants to do. If your client has a negative goal, it is important\nto balance it with a positive goal.\n[Page 66]\nDevelop Goals for Therapy 55\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 3.1: Miriam Wants a Better Marriage\nPractice using Questions to Develop Helpful Goals.\nAgenda Item #3: Which Goal Do I Focus on First?\nThe third stage in goal setting involves choosing where to begin. The therapist can simply say,\n\u201cLet\u2019s look over your goals and pick one to start with.\u201d Frequently a client\u2019s goals are interrelated, in\nwhich case it will be possible to work on more than one goal during a therapy session. For example,\nmany of Raoul\u2019s goals are related to work. You want to start with goals that are doable and where there\nis a good chance of success. When therapy helps clients make changes in their lives, clients become\nmore committed to therapy and more hopeful that their lives can improve.\nWhen Suzanne and her therapist looked at her goals, Suzanne\u2019s first priority was to fit into her new\nschool and try to make some friends among the other teachers. Her second goal was to do some fun\nthings with her children and husband. Suzanne\u2019s therapist thought these were good places to start and\nthat it might be possible to address both goals early on in therapy.\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 3.1: Set Specific Goals\nHomework: Practice CBT\nBefore moving on to the next chapter, take some time to try the homework.\nApply What You Learned to Clinical Examples\n\uf09dComplete the following exercise.\nExercise 3.1: Miriam Wants a Better Marriage\nApply What You Learned to Your Own Life\nBefore practicing this week\u2019s skills with your clients, let\u2019s start with focusing on your own goals.\n[Page 67]\n56 CBT Made Simple\nHomework Assignment #1\nSet Goals for Yourself\nStep 1: Take a moment to think about what you hoped to learn when you started reading this\nbook.

(Choose a specific client.)\n[Page 70]\nCHAPTER 4\nStructure Your Sessions\nDid you have a chance to try setting goals with a new or current client? Did you try any other homework assignments from previous chapters? When you think of the interventions that you\u2019ve tried, what\nwould you like to continue doing?\nIf you did not have a chance to try setting goals, take a moment and identify what obstacles got in\nthe way. Choose a specific client you will see this coming week who you think would be open to setting\ngoals. Now imagine yourself in your office setting goals with this client, and then try it!\nSet the Agenda\nWe have identified your client\u2019s problems, taken a history, explained the CBT model, and set goals.\nThis usually takes between one and two sessions. You are now ready to start addressing your client\u2019s\nproblems. In this chapter, I want to focus on how to structure or organize your therapy sessions.\nAgenda Item #1: Organize your therapy sessions.\nAgenda Item #2: Start with a check-in.\nAgenda Item #3: Collaboratively set an agenda.\nAgenda Item #4: Work the agenda.\nAgenda Item #5: Develop helpful homework for the next session.\nAgenda Item #6: Review the session and ask for feedback.\nWork the Agenda\nResearch shows that having a structure, and in particular setting an agenda, keeping to the agenda,\nand giving homework are key factors in effective therapy (Shaw et al., 1999). Many of my students tell\nme that structuring a session is one of the most helpful CBT skills that they learned; I think you will\nalso find it helpful.\n[Page 71]\n60 CBT Made Simple\nAgenda Item #1: Organize Your Therapy Sessions\nA structured session means that there is an order and organization to the therapy session. Here is\na brief overview of the five basic components. I will go over each one in more detail later in the chapter.\n1. Check in. This is a quick update on what has happened since the previous session and includes\na bridge to the previous session.\n2. Set the agenda. You and your client decide together which problems to focus on in the current\nsession. Homework from the previous session can be reviewed during the check-in or as part of\nthe agenda-setting process.\n3. Work the agenda. This involves addressing the identified problems on the agenda.\n4. Homework. You and your client collaborate to develop homework for the following session.\n5. Review. At the end of the session you briefly review with your client what was covered in the\ncurrent session and ask your client for feedback.\nAt first, covering all of these components in one session may seem like a lot. However, once you\nget used to using a structure, it will flow naturally; my prediction is that you will wonder how you ever\nworked any other way. Learning to use a structure is similar to learning to drive a car. When I first\nlearned to drive I was quite overwhelmed with how much I had to do all at once. I remember the first\ntime I parked my parents\u2019 car in the garage. I was so focused on not putting too much pressure on the\ngas, remembering where the brake was, and making sure that I did not hit anything on the right side\nthat I scratched the whole left side of the car on the garage wall. I didn\u2019t even have the necessary\nreflexes to hit the brake. With practice, driving became easy; and, you will be happy to know, I have\nnot smashed into any walls in years! Just as driving is now a routine activity for me, using a structure\nwill feel like the normal way of working once you have practiced with a few clients.\nYOUR ATTITUDE TOWARD A STRUCTURED SESSION\nSome therapists immediately like the idea of a structured session; others have negative reactions\nsuch as I will find a structure too rigid, My clients won\u2019t like it, and It will interrupt the flow of therapy.\nHowever, I believe that after you try structuring sessions with a few clients you will start to think,\nStructure gives my therapy more focus, and My clients will like having a chance to let me know what they\nwant to focus on. Take a moment to notice your own thoughts about using a structure.\nEXPLAIN THE STRUCTURE OF THE THERAPY SESSION TO\nYOUR CLIENT\nExplaining the structure of a therapy session will help your client feel more comfortable, as she will\nknow what to expect. I think of therapy as similar to visiting a foreign country. If you don\u2019t know the\ncustoms, and you don\u2019t know what to expect, you will be uncomfortable. When I was in my twenties I\nspent a year in Indonesia. I remember the first time I went to an Indonesian wedding. I walked into the\nroom, looked around, and had absolutely no idea what to do. To say the least, I felt very awkward. I can\n[Page 72]\nStructure Your Sessions 61\nstill remember my relief when my friend who had invited me took my arm, gently sat me down, and\nexplained what was going to happen and what I needed to do. Explaining the structure of therapy is\nsimilar to explaining the customs of a foreign country. Your clients will be more relaxed and trusting if\nthey know what to expect. You can find a Explain the Structure of a Therapy Session handout at http://\nwww.newharbinger.com/38501.\nExplain the structure of a therapy session with a new client. Here is an example of how you can\nexplain structuring a session to a new client. I explain both what I am going to do and why.\nWe\u2019ve spent some time getting an idea of your problems and setting goals for therapy. I want to\nexplain how I\u2019d like to structure the actual therapy sessions. Each week when you come in I\nwant to start with a brief check-in so that you can bring me up to date on anything that has\nhappened in your life since our last session and we can get a sense of how you are doing. Then\nI want to make a list of what you would like to talk about during our therapy session. I find this\nhelps make our sessions more focused, and that way I can be sure that we talk about what is\nmost important for you. I call this setting an agenda. Often you and I will have decided on\nsome homework that you are going to try in between sessions. If you had any homework, I will\ncheck on how it went. At the end of the session, we\u2019ll spend some time summarizing what\nwe\u2019ve covered and make sure that we are on the right track for you. We will also see if there is\nany homework that makes sense for you to try before our next session. How does that sound to\nyou?\nMost clients just say \u201cFine,\u201d after which I say, \u201cLet\u2019s start. Could you bring me up to date on how\nyour week has been and then we can see what you would like to focus on today?\u201d With a new client,\nthis is a straightforward process, and it almost always goes smoothly.\nExplain the structure of a therapy session with a current client. If you have not been using a structured format, you may feel awkward about introducing a structure with a current client. Here is an\nexample of how you could begin.\nI\u2019ve been thinking about our sessions, and I would like to try something new today. I thought\nwe would start with a brief check-in, so that you can bring me up to date on anything that has\nhappened in your life since our last session and we can get a sense of how you are doing. I\nwould then like to make a list of what you would like to focus on during our therapy session\ntoday and decide which issue you would like to start with. I think this will help focus our sessions, and that way I can be sure that we talk about what is most important for you. At the end\nwe\u2019ll spend some time summarizing what we covered and see how you liked working this way.\nNotice I am very clear about what we will do and that I will check whether my client likes this new\nway of working. My guess is that almost all of your clients will find having a structure helpful. Once you\nhave explained setting a structure, it becomes a normal part of therapy. Clients who are used to the\nstructure tend to spend time before the session thinking about what they want to talk about. Therapy\nbecomes more focused; clients usually come in with one or two agenda items. When a client is used to\na structured format, I start with, \u201cHello, good to see you. I want to check in and see how you have been\ndoing, see what you would like to focus on today, and check how your homework went.\u201d\n[Page 73]\n62 CBT Made Simple\nYour Turn!\n\uf0b2\nPractice in Your Imagination:\nExplain How a Session Is Structured\nI would like you to imagine explaining how a session is structured, first with a new client and then with\na current client. Before you start this exercise, rate from 1 to 10 how comfortable you feel explaining\nstructuring a session with both a new and a current client, with 1 being very comfortable and 10 being\nvery uncomfortable. At the end of the exercise, rate your level of comfort again to see if it has changed.\nNow, let\u2019s try the exercise.\nPractice with a new client. Imagine yourself in your office with a new client. Take a moment\nto look around; notice the sounds and smells in the room. Now imagine you want to explain\nhow you would like to structure the sessions. Read over how I explain structuring a session with\na new client while imagining yourself saying it. You can also use your own phrases. Really hear\nand feel yourself explaining how you want to structure the therapy sessions. Now imagine\nexplaining how you want to structure a session two more times with the same client. Each time\nimagine that your client responds positively.\nPractice with a current client. Choose a current client who you think would benefit from, and\nwould like, a structured approach. Try to get a picture of him or her in your mind. Now, imagine\nyourself in your office. Read over how I explain structuring a session with a current client while\nimagining yourself saying it. You can also use your own phrases. Now imagine explaining setting\na structure two more times with the same client. Each time imagine that your client responds\npositively.\nAgenda Item #2: Start with a Check-In\nThe check-in is an opportunity to get a general sense of how your client is doing, find out if there\nhave been any new developments in her life, and check on any issues that were raised in the last session.\nThat way, if there have been any major events, or changes in your client\u2019s life, you know about them\nright from the beginning of the session.\nBelow is a review of the main components of the check-in that are covered in most sessions. Depending\non the flow of the session, you may not necessarily complete the components in the order below.\n\u2022 Check whether there are any new developments in your client\u2019s life and generally how your\nclient has been since the last session.\n\u2022 Rate your client\u2019s overall mood since the previous session.\n\u2022 Bridge to the last session and ask about any issues you are concerned about.\n\u2022 Review the homework from the last session.\n\u2022 Identify possible agenda items.\n[Page 74]\nStructure Your Sessions 63\nLet\u2019s look at the different components.\nCheck how your client has been since the last session. You want to know if there have been any\nchanges since the last session and generally how your client has been feeling. If there has been a change\nin my client\u2019s mood, either for better or worse, I follow up with asking whether anything has changed\nor how my client understands the change in her mood.\nAsk your client to rate her mood. I usually ask my clients to rate their overall mood since the last\nsession. Most non-CBT therapists are not used to rating moods\u2014try it and see whether you and your\nclients find it helpful. Use a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst your client has ever felt, and 1 being\nvery happy. Rating helps your client engage in a process of self-reflection. It also gives you a quick sense\nof how your client is doing and if she is better, the same, or worse since the last session.\nLet me give you a quick example of how rating your client\u2019s mood can be helpful. When I started\nworking with Donald, his depression was at a 10 and we wondered whether he should be hospitalized.\nAfter about six months of therapy, Donald had significantly improved, and his moods were generally in\nthe 4 to 5 range. He had been away and I had not seen him for over two weeks. He started his session\nsaying he had been very depressed for the past two weeks, and he was scared that he would need to be\nhospitalized. He rated his overall mood at an 8. Realizing he was at an 8 and not a 10 helped him feel\nless frightened and enabled him to focus on the issues related to his increased depression.\nBridge to the last session. This is an opportunity to follow up on any issues from the previous session,\nincluding asking about specific areas in your client\u2019s life that you are worried about. For example, if I\nhave a client who has been suicidal, during the check-in I ask about current suicidal thoughts and\nbehavior. If a client is working on a specific issue, such as reducing weekend binge drinking or stopping\ncutting herself, even if the client doesn\u2019t mention drinking or cutting, I will ask as part of the check-in.\nThis provides a sense of continuity to the work of therapy.\nReview the homework. The check-in is a good time to review any homework, though some therapists\nreview homework as part of setting the agenda. A large meta-analytic study (Mausbach, Moore, Roesch,\nCardenas, & Patterson, 2010) found that homework completion was significantly related to a positive\noutcome in therapy. This means we need to do everything we can to encourage our clients to complete\ntheir homework. Asking about and reviewing homework tells your client that homework is important\nand encourages completion.\nIf your client completed her homework, give positive feedback and indicate that it is important.\nCheck what she actually did as well as the outcome. Clients don\u2019t always understand the homework in\nthe same way you intended it. You then want to ask what your client learned from doing the\nhomework.\nIf your client did not complete the homework, explore what got in the way. I usually ask my client\nwhat might help her complete homework in the future. If possible, we spend some time completing the\nhomework task in session. At the end of the session, I spend extra time making sure the homework for\nthe coming week makes sense to my client. Later in this chapter we are going to talk about how to\ndevelop effective homework.\nIdentify possible agenda items. Issues raised in the check-in are often good issues to put on the agenda\nfor the therapy session. For example, if a client tells you that she is thinking of breaking up with her\n[Page 75]\n64 CBT Made Simple\nboyfriend, or that she impulsively spent too much money on clothes again, you can say, \u201cI want to check\nif this is something that you would like to talk about today\u201d or, \u201cIs this something that we should put\non the agenda?\u201d It is important to check, as sometimes when asked, clients realize that this is not really\nwhat they want to talk about.\nKEEP THE CHECK-IN FOCUSED\nThe challenge with the check-in is to keep it short and focused. This means that rather than\nimmediately exploring an issue your client brings up, you need to contain the client and make sure this\nis what she wants to address in the therapy session. For example, imagine that during the check-in your\nclient starts giving a long and complicated example of a difficulty she is having with her child\u2019s teacher,\nand you have not yet set the agenda. You might say, \u201cI think this is an important topic. However, before\nwe talk more about it, I want to make sure this is what you want to focus on today and see whether\nthere are any other issues.\u201d If you have explained to your client that she will set the agenda at the beginning of the session, she will find it normal that you stop and check what she wants to talk about. She\nmay say, \u201cYes, this is the main issue.\u201d In that case, you have your agenda. The check-in is a balance\nbetween exploring issues enough to have some understanding of the issue and make sure there is no\nimmediate crisis, and not letting the check-in take the whole session.\nHere are some phrases that I have found helpful in keeping my client focused during the\ncheck-in:\n\u2022 That sounds like a really important issue. Before we talk more about it, I want to check if there\nis anything else that happened this week or anything else you want to bring up in therapy\ntoday.\n\u2022 That sounds pretty upsetting, and it would be important to talk more about it. Before we go\ninto more detail, I want to be sure I get an overall sense of how you have been since our last\nsession.\n\u2022 I can see how upsetting that would be. I want to write it down to be sure we get back to it, but\nI also want to check up on what we talked about last week.\nWhen a client comes in and starts talking about an important situation in her life, it can be hard\nnot to get pulled into starting therapy and forget about finishing the check-in or setting an agenda. You\ncan be straightforward and simply say, \u201cI just realized that we started talking about this issue, and I\nnever asked if this is the main topic you want to talk about today.\u201d\nA word of caution: while CBT sessions follow a set structure, it is important to be flexible and\nsensitive to your client\u2019s needs. For example, if a client starts a session by sobbing as she tells me about\nan awful event that just occurred, of course I would not rigidly keep to a structured session. I listen\nempathically, assess her immediate needs, and help her deal with her overwhelming emotions. However,\nafter I have listened to what happened, if the client is calmer, I might say, \u201cI want to talk more about\nthis. But I also want to double-check whether there is anything else you want to talk about today.\u201d I\nhave often been surprised that even if my client is in the middle of a crisis, there may be additional\nissues she wants to address.\n[Page 76]\nStructure Your Sessions 65\nSUZANNE\u2019S THERAPIST STARTS WITH A CHECK-IN\nLet\u2019s look at an example of how a check-in might work. This is Suzanne\u2019s fourth session and her\ntherapist has already explained using a structured session. Before reading the dialogue below, ask yourself: how would you start the session?\nTherapist: Hello, good to see you. I would like to check in, see how your week has been, make a list\nof what you would like to focus on today, and hear how the homework went.\nSuzanne: (looking downcast) Well, my week has been pretty much the same and pretty awful. I did\nthe homework and have it here.\nSuzanne\u2019s therapist wants to follow up on the homework but also wants her to rate her mood and continue\nwith the check-in.\nTherapist: It\u2019s great that you did the homework; I want to follow up on it, but first I want to get an\noverall sense of your week and check what we need to focus on today. Is that okay with\nyou? (Suzanne nods.) I was wondering\u2026if you were to rate your mood over the past week,\nwhere would you put it?\nNote how the therapist redirects Suzanne to the tasks of the check-in.\nSuzanne: Probably overall a 7; I just felt really down a lot of the time.\nTherapist: So the same as last week. Were there any times that were particularly hard, or any times\nwhen your mood was better?\nSuzanne: I\u2019m not sure, I was pretty down most of the week. Home is still the same. I can\u2019t stand the\nnew school. I think the teachers are really awful. No matter how hard I try, I just don\u2019t fit\nin. (Sounding more upset and agitated.) One of the teachers asked me what I do at lunch,\nsince she never sees me in the lunchroom. I didn\u2019t know what to say.\nThis could be a good issue to focus on in therapy as it relates to Suzanne\u2019s goal of \u201ctrying to fit into the\nnew school.\u201d However, it is also not a crisis issue and other issues might be more important. Notice her\ntherapist did not respond, \u201cHow did you feel when she asked you what you do at lunch?\u201d or \u201cTell me more\nabout that,\u201d as these responses would encourage Suzanne to keep talking about that incident.\nTherapist: Sounds like you were pretty upset by the teacher\u2019s comment. Before we talk more about it,\nI want to check if that was the main thing you wanted to talk about or whether there were\nother issues.\nSuzanne: That just happened this morning. I don\u2019t really want to spend time on it; it\u2019s not that\nimportant.\nAt this point in the check-in, Suzanne has indicated that there have not been any changes in her life and\nshe has rated her overall mood. There is nothing the therapist wants to raise as a bridge from the last\nsession. The next step is to discuss the homework and set an agenda.\n[Page 77]\n66 CBT Made Simple\nYour Turn!\nHelp Raoul Stay Focused During the Check-In\nLet\u2019s see how Raoul\u2019s therapist uses the check-in.\nTherapist: H ello, good to see you. I would like to check in, see how your week has been, see\nwhat you would like to focus on today, and go over your homework.\nRaoul: ( looking agitated) I\u2019ve been really anxious all week. I have a major deadline on a\nproject that\u2019s due, and I am way behind. My boss must think I am a total loser.\nMy anxiety is through the roof. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the matter with me, I should\njust do the project.\nLook at the three possible responses below. Choose the response that will help Raoul stay focused\non checking in.\n1. I can see why you would be anxious. You have done really good work in the past. What makes\nyou think that your boss thinks you are a loser?\n2. Let\u2019s see if we can help you with your deadline. What do you need to do to meet the deadline?\n3. Sounds like it would be important for us to look at what is going on with the project. Before we\ndo that, I want to check whether anything else happened this week that is important to you.\nResponse #3 keeps Raoul focused on the check-in and structure of therapy. His therapist is also demonstrating empathy about the urgency of the project. In response #1, the therapist tries to be supportive\nbut assumes that this issue with the boss is the main agenda item and has not checked in or set an\nagenda. In response #2, the therapist starts to problem solve without being sure this is the topic Raoul\nwants to focus on.\nTherapist S ounds like it would be important for us to look at what is going on with the\nproject. Before we do that, I want to check whether anything else happened this\nweek.\nRaoul: I \u2019ve been so anxious, I haven\u2019t been sleeping, but otherwise nothing is really new.\nIn this situation you have an agenda item that came from the check-in. Before you start discussing the\nagenda item, you need to ask Raoul to rate his overall mood during the week, and check if there are\nany other issues he would like to talk about in therapy. All you need to say is, \u201cBefore we talk about\nyour difficulties with the project, I want to do a quick check on how your overall mood has been this\npast week. How would you rate your mood, from 1 to 10?\u201d\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 4.1: Eulela Has a Very Bad Week\nPractice keeping the check-in focused when the client has multiple problems.\n[Page 78]\nStructure Your Sessions 67\nAgenda Item #3: Collaboratively Set an Agenda\nSetting an agenda involves collaborating with your client to make a list of what she wants to focus\non in the session. Some therapists think that setting an agenda sounds like a business meeting, but it is\nactually very client focused. When you set an agenda you are saying, \u201cI care that our therapy focuses\non what is important to you, so at the beginning of our session I want to spend a few minutes checking\non what you want to talk about.\u201d The process involves the client expressing her needs, and you, the\ntherapist, hearing and responding to her needs. This can be very empowering for your client.\nSetting an agenda also sets the expectation that therapy is not just about coming and talking; you\nexpect your client to work on specific problems and to give some thought to what she wants to talk\nabout. You, the therapist, can also add issues to the agenda. For example, if you talked with a teenager\u2019s\nprobation officer or parent, this would be a good time to let the teen know and add it to the agenda. It\nis helpful to write out the agenda and place it where you and your client can both see it. Many therapists have a white board or flip chart in their office, but you can also use a piece of paper.\nClear Agenda \uf05a Focused Therapy \uf05a Effective Therapy and Satisfied Clients\nOne of the many things I like about setting agendas is that it helps with what I call \u201cdoorknob\ntherapy.\u201d Doorknob therapy is when you have finished the session and your client has a hand on the\ndoorknob, ready to leave, and says, \u201cOh I forgot, I wanted to talk to you about this really important\nissue.\u201d You can then say, \u201cThat sounds like an important issue. Can we put it on the agenda for next\ntime, and start with it?\u201d If your client regularly raises important issues at the end of therapy, you can\nstart therapy by saying, \u201cThe last couple of sessions it wasn\u2019t until the end that you remembered an\nimportant issue you wanted to talk about. I thought it might be helpful to take a moment and think\nabout what you want to talk about today.\u201d As your client learns to set an agenda for her therapy session,\nshe is taking responsibility not only for her therapy, but also for making changes in her life.\nOnce you have a list of agenda items, the next step is to ask the client which issue she would like\nto start with. If a client has a large number of issues on the agenda, I simply say, \u201cThere are too many\nissues for us to talk about all of them today. Let\u2019s choose two or three and see if we can start to work\non them.\u201d It can also be helpful to decide roughly on the amount of time you will spend on each issue.\nAt about the midpoint of the session I usually let my client know the time and ask whether she wants\nto stay on the issue we are discussing or move to the next issue on the agenda.\nBelow are some helpful questions for setting an agenda. You can download a Questions to Help Set\nan Agenda handout at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\n\u2022 What would you like to focus on today?\n\u2022 What shall we put on the agenda for today?\n\u2022 Should we make a list of what you would like to talk about today, and then choose where you\nwould like to start?\n[Page 79]\n68 CBT Made Simple\nSUZANNE\u2019S AGENDA\nLet\u2019s look at how Suzanne\u2019s therapist sets the agenda after they finished the check-in. If you remember, in Suzanne\u2019s case there were no agenda items that came from the check-in.\nTherapist: I want to spend a few minutes making a list of what you would like to focus on today. I also\nwant to be sure we spend some time going over the homework, but I want to check whether\nthere is anything else you want to bring up.\nSuzanne: Actually, the main issue I want to talk about is that I got an invitation from the principal\nto a barbecue for new teachers at his home. I\u2019m really anxious, and not sure if I should go.\nTherapist: That sounds like an important issue. Anything else you want to talk about?\nSuzanne: Actually, yes, I have been really angry with my husband this past week. He promised to\ntake care of the kids on the weekend and ended up working. Those are the two big ones I\nwant to talk about.\nBoth issues relate to Suzanne\u2019s goals. It is just a question of which is more important to her.\nTherapist: Between the barbecue and being angry with your husband, where would you like to start?\nSuzanne: I think the barbecue, as I\u2019ve been really worried about it. The issue with my husband\ndoesn\u2019t feel as urgent.\nTherapist: Would it be okay if we start with looking at the homework, then spend some time talking\nabout the invitation to the barbecue, and if we have time, finish with looking at how angry\nyou have been with your husband?\nSuzanne: That sounds good.\nRAOUL\u2019S AGENDA\nRaoul had identified an agenda item in the check-in. His therapist wants to check whether there\nare additional issues he wants to talk about in session.\nTherapist: I would like to make a list of what we want to focus on today. One issue that you identified\nis the project that is due; is there anything else you would like to talk about today?\nRaoul: Actually, my wife wants to invite her sister to stay with us for a month while she looks for\na new job. I\u2019m really upset\u2014what if it takes her sister a really long time to find a job? We\ncan\u2019t just let her move in, but we can\u2019t say no, she\u2019s family. Her sister is a very difficult\nwoman who talks all the time. She expects us to just take care of her.\nTherapist: Sounds like it would be important to talk about your wife\u2019s sister maybe moving in, too. I\njust want to check if there is anything else.\n[Page 80]\nStructure Your Sessions 69\nNotice how the therapist summarizes the problem to indicate she heard Raoul\u2019s concern, but then sticks to\nsetting the agenda.\nRaoul: Those are the two. I have to say, the idea of my sister-in-law living with us is not great.\nShe\u2019s pretty critical, and I don\u2019t think she really likes me. She also puts my wife down all\nthe time.\nIt is tempting to start talking about the sister-in-law; however, we have not asked Raoul where he would\nlike to start.\nTherapist: We have two big issues; which one would you like to start with, the project at work or your\nsister-in-law?\nRaoul: I think the project, because if I don\u2019t get this project done, I risk another bad work evaluation! It\u2019s just all so much.\nTherapist: It is a lot. How about if we started with the project? I\u2019ll let you know when we are halfway\nthrough the session and then we can talk about your sister-in-law.\nNotice how the therapist sticks to the structure but adds the empathic comment \u201cIt is a lot\u201d to indicate\nthat she heard Raoul\u2019s distress.\nAgenda Item #4: Work the Agenda\nOnce you have set an agenda and decided on the first item, the next step is to start working on that\nissue in therapy. One of the challenges is sticking to an agenda item. In my experience, therapy drifts.\nFor example, a client may start talking about her anger toward her father, who criticized her parenting,\nand drift to talking about her feelings toward her cousin who is moving away. It is easy to stray from the\nagenda. When you talk with a friend, you drift from topic to topic; however, in therapy you want to\nfocus on a specific problem.\nThe easiest way to keep your client focused is to point out that she has strayed from the agenda and\nask her what she would like to do. You can gently say, \u201cWe were talking about your feelings toward your\nfather, and we\u2019ve moved to talking about your cousin. I am wondering if you want to go back to discussing your father, or if this issue with your cousin is more important.\u201d That way, you give your client a\nchoice. However, it is important to be flexible. If your client starts to talk about a painful issue that has\nbeen difficult for her to discuss or discloses a traumatic or very distressing event, you follow your client\u2019s\nlead.\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 4.2: Dewei Uses Marijuana Again\nPractice keeping to a structured session.\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 4.1: Check In and Set an Agenda\n[Page 81]\n70 CBT Made Simple\nAgenda Item #5: Develop Helpful Homework for\nthe Next Session\nHomework is an opportunity for your client to practice in her everyday life what she worked on in\ntherapy. In a meta-analytic study, Kazantzis, Whittington, and Dattilio (2010) found that overall, 62\npercent of clients improved when therapy included homework, compared with 38 percent of clients who\nimproved when therapy did not include homework. This seems to me like a pretty compelling reason\nto include homework in your therapy.\nHomework can take many forms. Some examples might be noticing the situations where your\nclient has specific difficulties, asking your client to complete a thought record, or asking your client to\ntry a new behavior.\nClients who complete homework tend to benefit more from therapy (Rees et al., 2005). So, how do\nyou increase the chances that your client will complete her homework? First, be sure to leave between\nfive and ten minutes at the end of the session to plan the homework. Assignments given in a rushed\nmanner tend not to get done. Second, use the following four criteria to develop helpful homework. You\ncan download a Guidelines for Helpful Homework handout at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\n\u2022 Developed collaboratively with your client\n\u2022 Specific and concrete\n\u2022 Related to the session\n\u2022 Doable\nDeveloped collaboratively. Ideally, the homework comes out of a discussion with your client. I often\nstart with asking, \u201cWhat do you think would be a good way to practice what we have talked about\ntoday during the coming week?\u201d While your client may have some good suggestions, frequently it is the\ntherapist who suggests specific homework. It is important to check your client\u2019s reaction to any homework that you suggest. I usually say, \u201cOne idea I had was for you to\u2026 What do you think?\u201d My clients\noften have good ideas about how to modify my suggestions.\nSpecific and concrete. You and your client need to be clear on what she is going to do for homework.\nTo decide if the homework is specific and concrete, ask yourself: Is there a specific behavior my client\nis going to try? How often will my client do the homework? Where and when will my client do the\nhomework? For example, \u201cTry to notice your negative thoughts\u201d is not very specific or concrete. A more\nspecific assignment would be, \u201cWhen you get angry at your teacher in science class, write down the\nthoughts that go through your mind. Do you think you can do this twice this coming week?\u201d Your\nclient then knows what she will do, in what situation, and how often.\nUnless homework is specific and concrete, it is impossible for your client to accurately evaluate\nwhether she completed the homework. For example, Raoul\u2019s homework was to start work on a group\nproject he had been avoiding. The next session Raoul reported that he contacted his colleagues and set\nup a meeting for next Tuesday. Raoul added, \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to do the homework; I should have already\nstarted the project.\u201d If his homework had been to contact his colleagues and set up a meeting, might\nRaoul have had a different reaction?\n[Page 82]\nStructure Your Sessions 71\nRelated to the session. Clients are more likely to complete homework that flows from the session. Let\u2019s\ngo back to Suzanne. One of her sessions focused on identifying specific situations she found difficult at\nschool. Listening to a relaxation tape would not be an effective homework task. While she might find\nthe tape helpful, it is not related to what she talked about in session. A better homework assignment\nwould be an activity related to the situations she found difficult at school. Effective homework is also\nrelated to a client\u2019s overall goals.\nDoable. Be sure to ask your client whether the homework seems doable and if she foresees any obstacles. If your client does foresee obstacles, problem solve how to overcome them.\nYour Turn!\nEvaluate Suzanne\u2019s Homework\nIn session 6 Suzanne talked about how she has stopped doing almost all of the activities she used to\nenjoy with her children. Suzanne had been very sad and self-critical during the session and often teary.\nWith only a few minutes left in the session, Suzanne sighed sadly and said, \u201cI have become a terrible\nmother. I would so like to go back to doing fun things with my children again.\u201d Suzanne\u2019s therapist\nresponded with, \u201cI would like to give you some homework. I think it would be really helpful if you could\ntry to do some fun things with your children this coming week.\u201d Does this homework meet the guidelines for helpful homework? Complete the chart below. You can find my answers in the appendix.\nHelpful Homework Guidelines Does Suzanne\u2019s Homework Meet\nThis Guideline?\nThe homework is developed collaboratively.\nThe homework is specific and concrete.\nThe homework is related to the session.\nThe homework is doable.\nBefore you look at the dialogue below, what questions could you ask Suzanne so that together you\ncould develop homework that fits the guidelines?\nTherapist: W e have about five minutes left in our session. You said you would like to start\ndoing some of the fun activities you used to enjoy with your children. Does that\ngive you any ideas for homework this coming week?\n[Page 83]\n72 CBT Made Simple\nIt is important to start developing the homework when you have at least five minutes left in the\nsession. Notice that the therapist first asks Suzanne whether she has any ideas.\nSuzanne: No, not really.\nTherapist: I am wondering if you could think of one activity that you used to do with your\nchildren that you would like to start doing again this week.\nIf Suzanne could think of an activity, together they would make a specific plan that included when\nthe activity could happen and specifically what Suzanne would do. The therapist would check that\nthe plan felt doable and that Suzanne had everything she needed to do the homework. Lastly, the\ntherapist would check if there were any obstacles.\nSuzanne and her therapist decided she would sit with her children for ten minutes on the couch\nand watch TV with them before starting dinner. Suzanne would do this Monday and Wednesday\nevening this coming week. Is this homework collaborative, specific and concrete, related to the session,\nand doable? I think it is.\nI don\u2019t want my client to think that she failed if she does not do the homework or it does not go\nwell. I often end our discussion about homework by saying, \u201cIf you do the homework, that is great and\nit will help us see how you can start moving toward your goals. If you don\u2019t do the homework, it is\nimportant that we explore what happened, as this will give us some clues as to what is keeping you\nstuck in your problems.\u201d\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 4.3: (a) Renee Tries to Catch Up at School, and\n(b) Wilson Feels Tense\nPractice using the homework guidelines.\nAgenda Item #6: Review the Session and Ask for Feedback\nThe last section of a structured session involves reviewing the session and asking for feedback. This\nsection is often forgotten or rushed, but it is just as important as the other components.\nREVIEW THE SESSION\nOne of the best ways to help your clients remember what was covered in therapy is to ask them to\nreview. If they forgot to mention a point you think was important, you can raise it and ask if it also\nseems important to your client. Many of my clients keep notebooks and either during the session or at\nthe end write down the points they want to remember. In my clinical notes, I also write down the main\npoints from the review. Below are some helpful ways to introduce reviewing the therapy session. You\ncan download a Questions to Review the Therapy Session handout at http://www.newharbinger\n.com/38501.\n[Page 84]\nStructure Your Sessions 73\n\u2022 Before we end, let\u2019s take a moment to review. What was most important to you from our\nsession today?\n\u2022 Before our session is up, let\u2019s take a moment to think over what we talked about today. I think\nwe talked about some very important things, and I want to be sure that we don\u2019t forget them.\nCould you write down anything you would like to remember?\n\u2022 I was thinking it would be helpful to stop and just summarize what we talked about. How could\nyou put what we talked about into your own words?\nA few years ago I noticed that if I thought the session had not gone well, I would \u201cforget\u201d to review,\nor else I conveniently ran out of time. When I started reviewing even when I thought the session had\nnot gone well, I discovered that a good part of the time my client had found the session helpful. This\nwas very useful information. If my client had not found the session helpful, this was also valuable information. We now had a problem we could discuss and potentially solve rather than my worrying about\nthe session.\nASK YOUR CLIENT FOR FEEDBACK\nAfter you review the session, it is a good time to ask for feedback. This is especially important in\nthe beginning of the therapy relationship. I simply say, \u201cI want to check if it feels that we are on the\nright track\u201d or \u201cI want to check if there was anything that we did that was particularly helpful for you.\nWas there anything that didn\u2019t feel like a helpful use of our time?\u201d\nYour Turn!\n\uf0b2\nPractice in Your Imagination: Review a Session with Your Client\nChoose a client you are currently seeing who you think would be open to reviewing the session. Before\nwe begin, rate from 1 to 10 how comfortable you are with asking your client to review the session, with\n1 being very comfortable and 10 being very uncomfortable. At the end of the exercise, rate your level\nof comfort again to see whether it has changed. Now, let\u2019s try the exercise.\nImagine you are at the end of a session and you want to ask your client to review the session.\nTry to get a picture of him or her in your mind. Imagine yourself in your office. Take a moment\nto look around, notice the sounds and smells in the room. Read over Questions to Review the\nTherapy Session while imagining yourself asking the questions. You can also use your own\nphrases. Really hear and feel yourself introducing the idea of reviewing. Now imagine reviewing two more times with the same client. Each time imagine that your client responds\npositively.\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 4.2: Review and Ask for Feedback on the Session\n[Page 85]\n74 CBT Made Simple\nHomework: Practice CBT\nBefore continuing with the next chapter, take some time to try the homework.\nApply What You Learned to Clinical Examples\nComplete the following exercises.\nExercise 4.1: Eulela Has a Very Bad Week\n\uf09d\nExercise 4.2: Dewei Uses Marijuana Again\nExercise 4.3: (a) Renee Tries to Catch Up at School, and (b) Wilson Feels Tense\nApply What You Learned to Your Own Life\nMost of us wake up every morning and there is a long list of what we have to do. We have to prioritize and figure out what is most important to us, or we would never get anything done. Setting agendas\nin therapy is similar to figuring out what is most important to attend to in our own lives.\nHomework Assignment #1\nUse a Structure in Your Life\nAn agenda is a list to help your clients identify and prioritize what is most important to them. Many\npeople make lists to help them organize their lives and figure out what needs to be done first. I thought it\nwould be helpful for you to reflect on your own experience of making lists and identifying your priorities.\nFirst, consider lists you\u2019ve written in your life. Take a moment and think about a time when it was\nhelpful to make a list, and a time when it was not helpful. Then identify factors that contributed to the\nlist being helpful and factors that contributed to the list not being helpful.\nSecond, think about the next couple of days. Make a list of things you need to accomplish in the\nnext few days that are not part of your normal routine. It can be either at work or in your personal life.\nAfter you\u2019ve made the list, pick three items that are a priority to accomplish. Try to make them as\nconcrete and specific as possible.\nThird, think about this exercise and if there are any implications for how you can make agenda\nsetting more helpful for your clients. Now take a moment to review what you learned.\nApply What You Learned to Your Therapy Practice\nI want to explore your expectations and any concerns you have about using a structured format.\n[Page 86]\nStructure Your Sessions 75\nHomework Assignment #2\nExplore Your Attitudes about Using a Structured Format\nChoose two clients whom you are currently working with. Imagine that with each client you set an\nagenda and review at the end of the session. I am going to ask you to write down your predictions.\nComplete the following form for each client.\n1. My client will:\n1 2 3 4 5\nDislike using a Have a neutral Like using a\nstructure reaction structure\n2. I will:\n1 2 3 4 5\nDislike using a Have a neutral Like using a\nstructure reaction structure\n3. What I imagined happening:\n4. My main concern about using a structured format with this client is:\nHomework Assignment #3\nStructure a Session with a New and Current Client\nChoose two clients with whom you are going to try and structure a session. If possible, choose one new\nclient and one current client with whom you are not using a structured session. You are more likely to\nlearn a new skill if you practice the different components individually before you put it all together. I\nwant you to start by only practicing three components of a structured session: (1) explain the structure\nof a therapy session, (2) set an agenda, and (3) choose an agenda item to focus on. Here are the three\nsteps:\n[Page 87]\n76 CBT Made Simple\nExplain the structure of a therapy session: Explain to your client that you would like to make\na list of what she wants to talk about. You can look back through this chapter to see how to\nintroduce setting a structure with new and current clients. Remember that to set an agenda all\nyou have to do is say, \u201cI would like to make a list of what you would like to talk about today.\u201d If\nit is the first time you are trying to set an agenda, you may find it helpful to have a copy of the\nhandout Explain the Structure of a Therapy Session beside you.\nSet an agenda: Once you and your client have set the agenda and identified the issues he or she\nwould like to focus on, write them down where you can both see them.\nChoose an agenda item: Once you have your list of agenda items, ask your client which item\nhe or she would like to start with.\nIf you are setting an agenda with a current client, at the end of the session ask if your client liked\nsetting an agenda. You can say, \u201cI am curious whether you liked the structure we used today where we\nmade a list of what you wanted to work on.\u201d If your client had a positive reaction, ask if she would like\nto continue using this structure in the future.\nAfter you try setting an agenda for the first time, notice if your predictions about your own and\nyour client\u2019s reactions were accurate. Take a moment to think about what you learned. Have your predictions changed?\nHomework Assignment #4\nReview the Session with Your Client\nOnce you have tried setting an agenda with two clients, I would like you to include one more component of a structured session.\nAt the end of the session, ask your client to review the session. Remember, all you have to do is ask,\n\u201cWhen you look over our work today, what would you like to remember?\u201d As you did in the last exercise, notice if your predictions of your own and your client\u2019s reactions were accurate.\nLet\u2019s Review\nAnswer the questions under the agenda items.\nAgenda Item #1: Organize your therapy sessions.\n\u2022 What are the main components of a structured therapy session?\n\u2022 What is the importance of each component?\n[Page 88]\nStructure Your Sessions 77\nAgenda Item #2: Start with a check-in.\n\u2022 What is included in a check-in?\nAgenda Item #3: Collaboratively set an agenda.\n\u2022 How could you introduce setting an agenda with a new client?\n\u2022 How could you introduce setting an agenda with a current client?\nAgenda Item #4: Work the agenda.\n\u2022 How could you respond when your client drifts off the agenda topic?\nAgenda Item #5: Develop helpful homework for the next session.\n\u2022 What are two guidelines for helpful homework?\nAgenda Item #6: Review the session and ask for feedback.\n\u2022 How could you ask your client to review?\nWhat Was Important to You?\nWhat idea(s) or concept(s) would you like to remember?\nWhat idea(s) or skill(s) would you like to apply to your own life?\nWhat would you like to try this coming week with a client? (Choose a specific client.)\n[Page 89] [Page 90]\nPART 2\nUnderstand Your\nClients\u2019 Problems [Page 91]\nCHAPTER 5\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Feelings,\nPhysical Reactions, and Behaviors\nIn the previous chapter we covered how to structure a session. Did you have a chance to try setting an\nagenda with a new client or a current client? How did it go? What about reviewing at the end of the\nsession? How did using a structure make a difference to your therapy sessions? I am hoping that you will\nkeep using a structured format. One of the best ways to maintain change is to assign yourself a specific\ntask that reinforces your new behavior. Would you be willing to pick four clients and try setting an\nagenda and reviewing?\nIf you did not have a chance to try structuring a session, what got in the way? Did you have negative predictions about structured sessions? Try to set an agenda with just one client this coming week\nand notice how your client responds.\nSet the Agenda\nIn this chapter we will cover how to identify situations that trigger your client and then how to use the\nfour-factor model to understand your client\u2019s reactions. We will focus on identifying your client\u2019s feelings, physical reactions, and behavior. I want to leave identifying thoughts for the next two chapters.\nAgenda Item #1: Use the four-factor model in therapy.\nAgenda Item #2: Identify your clients\u2019 triggers.\nAgenda Item #3: Understand your clients\u2019 reactions.\nAgenda Item #4: Help your clients identify their feelings.\nAgenda Item #5: Help your clients identify their physical reactions.\nAgenda Item #6: Help your clients identify their behaviors.\nAgenda Item #7: Remain empathic.\n[Page 92]\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Feelings, Physical Reactions, and Behaviors 81\nWork the Agenda\nClients come to therapy with all kinds of problems. For example, Suzanne is too anxious to talk to the\nother teachers and make friends, Raoul is procrastinating on his project at work, some clients drink too\nmuch, and others feel panic when they try to use an elevator. In this chapter we are going to start using\nthe four-factor model to understand your clients\u2019 problems.\nAgenda Item #1: Use the Four-Factor Model in Therapy\nAlmost every client has specific situations that trigger him, and when triggered he automatically\nzooms down a well-worn negative path. The path is strewn with a mix of feelings, physical reactions,\nbehaviors, and thoughts and ends in a big negative jumbled black ball. It happens so quickly and automatically that your client never pauses to notice or question his negative path. He is just aware of the\nbig negative ball at the end. The negative path feels like the only option. Take a look at figure 5.1 to see\nhow the negative path works.\nBLACK BALL\nTrigger\nSituation\nNEGATIVE PATH\nFigure 5.1. Your client\u2019s negative path.\nWe are going to spend the next three chapters using the four-factor model to help your clients hit\nthe pause button on their negative automatic paths (see figure 5.2). This starts a process of selfreflection, and it is often the first time that a client has fully acknowledged his own thoughts and feelings. As clients become more aware of how the four factors are maintaining their problems, change\nbecomes a possibility.\n[Page 93]\n82 CBT Made Simple\nFeelings? Thoughts?\nUNDERSTAND\nPAUSE\n4 FACTORS\nSelf-Reflection\nTrigger\n&\nSituation\nPOSSIBILITY\nOF CHANGE\nPhysical Behavior?\nreactions?\nFigure 5.2. Your client hits the pause button.\nThe first step involves identifying a trigger situation and then identifying and recording your client\u2019s feelings, physical reactions, behaviors, and thoughts. We are going to use the Understand Your\nReaction worksheet (which is the same as the first five columns of a thought record) as a tool to identify\nand record your client\u2019s reactions. You can download a copy at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\nUnderstand Your Reaction\nSituation Feelings Physical Behaviors Thoughts\nReactions\n(Rate 1\u201310)\n(Rate 1\u201310)\nWhat? Who? What did I feel? How did my body What did I do? What did I think?\nWhere? When? react?\n[Page 94]\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Feelings, Physical Reactions, and Behaviors 83\nIf you are not used to writing during therapy, you may initially find it awkward. However, once you\ntry it, I think you will find writing very useful. For most clients, writing down thoughts and feelings\ncreates a different experience from saying them in their head; writing encourages pausing and reflecting. Using a written worksheet helps organize the session. Plus, your clients can use the Understand\nYour Reaction worksheet outside of therapy to slow down and identify what is going on when they are\nupset.\nWhile I think it is important to try a written worksheet, CBT is flexible; identifying the four factors\ncan also be done orally, as part of a therapy dialogue.\nAgenda Item #2: Identify Your Clients\u2019 Triggers\nEach client has specific types of situations that set his automatic negative path in motion; these are\nhis triggers. To address your client\u2019s problems, you need to know which situations are difficult for him\nand trigger his negative path.\nWhile many clients are aware of their triggers, other clients have trouble identifying their specific\ntrigger situations. For example, a client may tell you that he is \u201calways\u201d sad, or \u201calways\u201d drinks too\nmuch, and can\u2019t identify specific problematic situations. Identifying your client\u2019s triggers helps you start\nto see patterns and then know what to focus on in therapy.\nA helpful first step is to ask your client to monitor his problematic feelings or behaviors and see if\nthere are some situations where his feelings are stronger or his behavior is more extreme. For example,\na client of mine, Elsbeth, came to therapy because she was always angry. When I asked for examples of\nspecific situations, she responded that she was angry \u201call the time.\u201d Her first homework assignment was\nto monitor her angry feelings and see when they were strongest. She came back having discovered that\nshe was the most angry when her tee nage son didn\u2019t do what she wanted him to do, for example, when\nhe did his homework at 2 a.m., broke curfew, or did not do his chores. She discovered that her anger\ntoward her son was spilling over into the rest of her life.\nI often use a simple monitoring worksheet like the one below. You can download a copy of What Is\nYour Trigger? at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501. I ask my clients to note situations that were the\nmost difficult for them and to rate their feelings from 1 to 10. We often start to see patterns. For\nexample, Suzanne told her therapist that she was very unhappy in her new school \u201call of the time.\u201d As\nhomework, her therapist asked her to notice situations where she was the most unhappy and rate her\nmoods. Look at how Suzanne filled in the worksheet below. Do you see a pattern?\n[Page 95]\n84 CBT Made Simple\nWhat Is Your Trigger?\nSituation Feelings\n(Rate from 1\u201310;\n1 = very happy;\n10 = very unhappy)\nMonday: Lunch, no one to eat with Unhappy: 10\nTuesday: At the school assembly, the two teachers sitting next to me Unhappy: 8\nwere talking together and did not talk to me.\nWednesday: I overheard a teacher talking about a party she was having, Unhappy: 10\nand she did not invite me.\nThursday: One of the teachers asked the person next to me at recess if Unhappy: 10\nshe wanted to work on the school play with her.\nFriday: I stood alone at recess. Unhappy: 9\nWhen Suzanne and her therapist looked at the worksheet, they discovered that she was the most\nunhappy in social situations with other teachers. None of the situations she identified involved students. Suzanne was surprised. Charting her reactions helped her focus on the situations that were difficult for her, and it also helped her realize that some aspects of school were going fairly well.\nHELP YOUR CLIENTS IDENTIFY SITUATIONS THAT ARE SPECIFIC\nAND CONCRETE\nYou begin the session with a check-in, set the agenda, and then decide on the agenda item you\nwant to start with. What happens next? You want to identify a specific situation that is problematic for\nyour client and that you can work on in therapy.\nFrequently, your client will describe his trigger situation in vague terms, and you don\u2019t really understand what happened. You need to help your client become more specific and concrete. A specific and\nconcrete description includes what happened, with whom, and the specific time and place it occurred.\nFor example, a vague description of a situation would be \u201cMy partner doesn\u2019t respect my work\u201d; a more\nconcrete and specific description would be \u201cMy partner told me that she thought her work was more\nimportant than mine.\u201d Below are some additional examples of situations that are described vaguely,\nalong with more specific and concrete descriptions of the same situations.\n[Page 96]\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Feelings, Physical Reactions, and Behaviors 85\nExamples of Vague and Specific Situations\nVague Description Same Situation Described in a Specific\nand Concrete Manner\nMy child was rude to her stepmother. My daughter swore at her stepmother and left\nthe room when her stepmother asked her to help\nwith the dishes after dinner.\nI have to walk on eggshells around my father; he I asked my father if I could have the car on\ngets angry at the smallest thing. Saturday night, and he yelled at me that I should\nknow he wanted it to go out with his friends.\nI had a few too many drinks over the weekend. I was at a bar with my friends and probably\ndrank over eight beers and at least four shots.\nThe more specific and concrete your client\u2019s description of the situation, the more your client will\nbe emotionally engaged with the situation, and the more he will have access to his feelings and thoughts.\nConsider your own experience: Think of someone you are a little annoyed with. Now, think of a specific situation when you were annoyed with this person. Try to remember the situation in detail.\nChances are that as you thought about a specific situation, you became more annoyed and your feelings\nand thoughts became more immediate. The same thing will happen when your clients talk about specific situations.\nSometimes your client\u2019s situation is a long, complicated story. In this case, listen to the whole story\nand then ask what was the worst or most difficult part for your client. It is helpful to identify a situation\nthat lasts from a few seconds to thirty minutes (Greenberger & Padesky, 2016)\u2014any longer and your\nclient will probably have a large variety of feelings and thoughts, and it will be hard to focus on the\nmain ones.\nQuestions to help identify a specific situation. I know I have a clear understanding of the situation\nif I can form a picture in my mind. If not, I ask my client the W questions: What happened? Who was\ninvolved? Where did it happen? and When did it happen? I am looking for the facts of the situation.\nIn some ways it is similar to being a detective or a newspaper reporter on a fact-finding mission, except\nrather than being a solo operator, you are a fact-finding team with your client. I usually start with being\nsure I understand What happened.\nLet\u2019s look at an example. One of my clients was upset with her boyfriend. I asked for an example.\nShe responded, \u201cMy boyfriend was really mean to me last night.\u201d Let\u2019s see if we have the answers to the\nW questions. Do we know What happened? No, we don\u2019t. Do we know Who was involved? Yes, the\nboyfriend, but we don\u2019t know if anyone else was involved. Do we know Where it happened? No, we\ndon\u2019t. Do we know When it happened? Yes, it happened last night. Before we can start to explore my\nclient\u2019s feelings, physical reactions, behaviors, and thoughts, we need a clearer idea of what occurred.\nHere is another example. If you remember from chapter 4, Suzanne\u2019s main agenda item was about\nbeing invited to a barbecue at the principal\u2019s house. She doesn\u2019t feel like going and thinks she will just\n[Page 97]\n86 CBT Made Simple\nsay no. Her therapist wants to get a better understanding of the situation. Let\u2019s look at what happens\nwhen her therapist uses the four W questions.\nSuzanne: I was invited to a barbecue event at the principal\u2019s house.\nTherapist: I want to make sure that I understand. (Notice her therapist explains what she will do.) What\nis the event?\nSuzanne: The principal invited all the new teachers to her home for a barbecue.\nHer therapist doesn\u2019t want to fire a volley of questions at Suzanne, but she also wants more information.\nYou can ask more than one of the W questions at the same time.\nTherapist: Can you give me a better sense of what\u2019s involved with the barbecue, for example, who was\ninvited, where is it happening, and when?\nSuzanne\u2019s therapist learns that Suzanne was invited to a barbecue at her principal\u2019s house along with the\nthree other new teachers. It is taking place after school in two weeks. Once you are clear on the situation,\nyou and your client can start to figure out why she is upset by using the four-factor model.\nYour Turn!\nHelp Neale Identify a Specific Situation\nNeale, a thirty-six-year-old man, starts a session by saying he wants to focus on his relationship with his\nmother. Try to help him specify a situation that he wants to work on.\nTherapist: You said you wanted to focus on your relationship with your mother today.\nNeale: Everything is going wrong; my relationship with my mother is worse than ever.\nLook at the three possible responses below and pick the one that will help you get a better understanding of the situation that is troubling Neale.\n1. Can you tell me more about your relationship with your mother?\n2. I can see that your relationship with your mother is really upsetting you; it feels as if everything\nis going wrong.\n3. Could you give me an example of what is going wrong between your mother and you?\nResponse #3 is the most likely to help the client identify a specific situation. Response #1 is too vague.\nIf this was the first time you were hearing about Neale\u2019s difficulties with his mother, it could be a good\nquestion, but it does not help you focus on a specific difficult situation. Response #2 is supportive, but\nit also does not help identify a difficult situation.\nTherapist: C ould you give me an example of what is going wrong between your mother and\nyou?\n[Page 98]\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Feelings, Physical Reactions, and Behaviors 87\nNeale: We had a big family dinner on Sunday afternoon and it was just awful. My\nmother and I just don\u2019t get along.\nBefore looking at the therapist\u2019s response, ask yourself what the therapist could ask to help Neale be\nmore specific about what happened.\nTherapist: You were saying that the family dinner was just awful last Sunday. Can you tell\nme what happened?\nNeale: I am so upset because my mother was so critical of me.\nAsk yourself the W questions: Do you know What happened? Who was involved? Where it happened?\nWhen it happened? You don\u2019t know what happened; you know Neale\u2019s mother was involved and that\nthe situation occurred at a family dinner last Sunday. We need more information.\nLook at the three possible responses below and pick the one that will help you get a better understanding of the situation.\n1. When you say your mother was critical of you, can you help me understand what your\nmother did?\n2. Can you tell me more about your mother being critical?\n3. When your mother was critical, what did you think?\nResponse #1 is most likely to help Neale become more specific about the situation. Response #2 is a\ngood start, but it is too vague. Neale could react by talking about his feelings or thoughts, or about the\nsituation. In response #3 you don\u2019t know what the client means by critical, so it is too early to ask\nabout his thoughts.\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 5.1: Raoul\u2019s Boss Is Difficult\nPractice identifying a specific situation.\nTHE FACTS ABOUT A SITUATION ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE\nMEANING OF A SITUATION\nClients frequently include their thoughts or interpretation of what the situation meant when\ndescribing the situation. When you start to separate the facts about the situation from the thoughts and\nfeelings about the situation, you and your client begin to get a more objective idea of what occurred.\nLet\u2019s look at an example. A client identifies the following situation: \u201cMy wife doesn\u2019t care about my\nmother; she told my mother we were too busy to visit her.\u201d The facts of the situation are that his wife\ntold his mother that they were too busy to visit; the client\u2019s thoughts or interpretation of the situation\nare, \u201cMy wife doesn\u2019t care about my mother.\u201d Let\u2019s look at another example. A client says, \u201cMy new\n[Page 99]\n88 CBT Made Simple\ngirlfriend asked me home to meet her parents. She\u2019s moving too fast; I don\u2019t want to get serious.\u201d In this\nexample, the facts of the situation are the girlfriend invited the client home to meet her parents; the\nthoughts or what the situation meant to the client are, \u201cShe is moving too fast; I don\u2019t want to get\nserious.\u201d\nOften a client will use an adjective to describe the other person in the situation; the adjective is\nusually the client\u2019s thought about the other person. For example, a client says, \u201cMy child was very\ninconsiderate toward the teacher.\u201d \u201cInconsiderate\u201d is an adjective. You know that the client thought the\nchild was inconsiderate, but you don\u2019t know what the child did. If you want to understand the facts of\nthe situation, it is helpful to ask, \u201cWhat did your child do that made you think he was inconsiderate?\u201d\nSometimes a client will include his feelings as part of the situation; for example, when describing a\nsituation he will say, \u201cI was so angry at my mother when she was late.\u201d The fact is that his mother was\nlate; the feeling is anger. A client can also include his behavior in the description of the situation, for\nexample, \u201cWhen my boss yelled at another coworker, I just sat there and did nothing.\u201d The boss yelling\nat another coworker is the fact in the situation; the client doing nothing is the client\u2019s behavior.\nYour Turn!\nSeparate the Facts about the Situation from\nthe Thoughts about the Situation\nBelow are examples of situations where clients mixed up the facts about the situation and their thoughts\nabout the situation. In the examples below, separate the facts about the situation from the client\u2019s\nthoughts. Complete the worksheet below before looking at my answers in the appendix.\nExamples of Situations Facts about the Situation Client\u2019s Thoughts about\nthe Situation\nInstead of doing homework,\nI was lazy and went out with\nfriends.\nMy boss told me I did a good\njob, but he didn\u2019t really mean it.\nMy child is not normal; he\nis not crawling at age five\nmonths.\nThe huge mess my husband left\nin the kitchen\n[Page 100]\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Feelings, Physical Reactions, and Behaviors 89\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 5.2: Find the Facts\nPractice distinguishing the facts about a situation from the thoughts and feelings about the\nsituation.\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 5.1: Identify a Trigger and Explain the Understand Your\nReaction Worksheet\nAgenda Item #3: Understand Your Clients\u2019 Reactions\nIdentifying trigger situations is an important first step. The next step is using the four-factor model\nto understand your client\u2019s reaction. It is important to explain what you will be doing, both so that your\nclient understands the process and so that he learns a tool to use outside of therapy. I use the Understand\nYour Reaction worksheet that we looked at in the beginning of the chapter as a structure. I show the\nworksheet to my client and explain each column. I usually say:\nI think you did a really good job identifying the situation. What I would like to do now is to\nsee if we can understand your reaction by identifying your feelings, physical reactions, behaviors, and thoughts\u2014and then see how they all go together. I call this using the four-factor\nmodel.\nI want to complete this worksheet. (I get out the worksheet or draw one on a sheet of paper.)\nYou see there are five columns. This first column says \u201cSituation,\u201d and we are going to write\ndown the situation we just identified. (I write it down or the client writes it down.) We are then\ngoing to see if we can identify your feelings, physical reactions, behaviors, and thoughts and\nwrite them down in the next columns.\nWhen clients see the five columns, they automatically become more organized, and some of the\njumble and distress starts to diminish. My own attitude is one of engaged curiosity, as this models a\nhelpful attitude my client can take toward his own problems. Notice how I start by saying, \u201cI think you\ndid a really good job identifying the situation.\u201d Providing positive feedback for learning a specific skill\nreinforces the skill and helps the therapy relationship. Many of our clients rarely receive any positive\nfeedback; to hear that they did something well is important.\nYOUR TURN!\n\uf0b2\nPractice in Your Imagination: Explain the Understand\nYour Reaction Worksheet\nChoose a client who you think would benefit from identifying his or her feelings, physical reactions,\nbehaviors, and thoughts. Before you start, rate from 1 to 10 how comfortable you feel introducing and\nusing the Understand Your Reaction worksheet. At the end of the exercise, rate your level of comfort\nagain to see if it changed. Now, let\u2019s try this exercise.\n[Page 101]\n90 CBT Made Simple\nImagine you want to introduce the Understand Your Reaction worksheet to your client. Try to get\na picture of him or her in your mind. Imagine yourself in your office with your client. See your office;\nnotice the sounds and smells in the room. Read over how I suggest introducing the worksheet while\nimagining yourself saying the words. You can also use your own phrases. Really hear and feel yourself\ntaking out the worksheet and explaining it to your client. Now, imagine explaining the worksheet two\nmore times with the same client. Each time, imagine that your client responds positively.\nAgenda Item #4: Help Your Clients Identify Their Feelings\nIn this book, we are going to start with identifying feelings, then physical reactions and behavior,\nand lastly thoughts. This is because most clients are more aware of their feelings than their thoughts\nand tend to come in talking about feelings. However, in practice, you could start with any of the four\nfactors. I often start with the factor that my client brings up first.\nThe ability to label feelings is a part of affect regulation, or managing one\u2019s feelings in a healthy way.\nWhen you ask your client, \u201cWhat were you feeling?\u201d you are asking him to pause and reflect, which\nautomatically interrupts his negative path. Labeling feelings helps both client and therapist understand\nthe client\u2019s reactions. Asking your client to label his feelings gives the message that you are interested\nin his experience. Clients\u2019 feelings can also guide therapy. You may want to try different interventions\ndepending on your client\u2019s dominant feelings. For example, if your client tells you he feels \u201cbad,\u201d it is\nhard to know where to start, but if he tells you he feels \u201canxious,\u201d you can start to explore his fears.\nWHAT ARE FEELINGS?\nLet\u2019s see if we can understand Suzanne\u2019s feelings about going to the principal\u2019s barbecue. When\nSuzanne\u2019s therapist asked her what she was feeling, Suzanne answered, \u201cI just don\u2019t want to go.\u201d Let\u2019s\nstop for a moment. Suzanne\u2019s response is not a feeling, it is a thought about the behavior Suzanne\nwants\u2014or in this case, doesn\u2019t want\u2014to do (she does not want to go to the barbecue).\nIf Suzanne\u2019s response was not a feeling, then what is a feeling? As I mentioned earlier, feelings are\nusually one word. There are generally six main emotions that clients identify: happy, mad, sad, anxious,\nguilty, and ashamed. While there are many other feelings, these are the basic ones. Take a moment to\nlook at the Identify Your Feelings handout, which is a more comprehensive list of feelings; you can download it at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501. Reading over this handout will help expand your own\nvocabulary. Clients find it helpful when you find a word that exactly captures what they are feeling.\nSTRATEGIES TO IDENTIFY YOUR CLIENT\u2019S FEELINGS\nWhile some clients can give very accurate and detailed descriptions of what they are feeling, others\nhave difficulty. Remember my client Elsbeth, from earlier in the chapter, who was angry with her son\nfor not doing his homework or his chores? Initially she was only aware of her anger, but when we started\npaying attention to her feelings, she discovered that she was more anxious than angry.\nIf your client has trouble identifying his feelings, here are some interventions you can try:\n\u2022 Show your client the Identify Your Feelings handout and ask if one of these feelings seems to fit.\n[Page 102]\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Feelings, Physical Reactions, and Behaviors 91\n\u2022 Ask your client to notice his feelings during the coming week, and see if he can start to identify\nhis feelings. Often just paying attention to feelings can be helpful. Some clients have never\nasked themselves the question, What am I feeling?\n\u2022 Ask your client to notice when he becomes physically tense and to try and label his feelings at\nthat moment.\n\u2022 You can discuss feelings with your client and how to know whether someone is happy, sad,\nmad, glad, anxious, guilty, or ashamed. Ask your client to identify physical symptoms, behaviors, and thoughts that go with each feeling.\nRaoul generally found it hard to identify his feelings. In one of his therapy sessions, he came in\nlooking very agitated and said he was really upset about his boss\u2019s comment at a meeting. His boss had\nsaid that Raoul\u2019s project seemed to be going slowly, and he hoped Raoul would be able to meet the\ndeadline. When the therapist asked Raoul if he could describe his feelings a little more, Raoul shrugged,\nlooked down at the floor, and said he felt \u201cawful.\u201d His therapist thought it would be helpful if Raoul\ncould start to be more aware of his feelings. She tried three interventions. First, they talked about feelings and how you could know what you are feeling. Second, his therapist gave him the Identify Your\nFeelings handout and discussed it with him. Third, for homework his therapist asked him to record\nthree situations when he felt awful, to note what was happening in his body, and to look at the Identify\nYour Feelings handout and try to label his feelings. When Raoul came back the next week, he had\ncompleted his homework and was able to identify that he felt nervous and angry. This helped him and\nhis therapist start to address these feelings more specifically. His therapist also started directly asking\nwhether he was nervous or angry when he said he was feeling \u201cawful\u201d or \u201cupset.\u201d\nOne of the difficulties in identifying feelings is that we often use \u201cfeel\u201d when we are making a judgment and are really describing what we \u201cthink.\u201d For example, you might say, \u201cI feel that the movie was\ntoo slow\u201d when what you really mean is \u201cI think the movie was too slow.\u201d It is even more difficult to\ndifferentiate thoughts and feelings in statements like \u201cI feel stupid\u201d or \u201cI feel incompetent.\u201d Even though\nthese statements start with \u201cI feel,\u201d they are really judgmental thoughts about ourselves. We say, \u201cI feel\nstupid\u201d when we mean, \u201cI think I am stupid.\u201d Thoughts are so closely connected to feelings that it can\nbe hard at first to see the difference, but the more you use the four-factor model, the easier it will get.\nNow, let\u2019s go back to Suzanne and see how her therapist helps her identify her feelings about the\ninvitation to the principal\u2019s barbecue.\nTherapist: I hear you don\u2019t want to go, but I am wondering what your feelings are when you think of\nthe invitation.\nSuzanne: What do you mean? I just don\u2019t want to go.\nOften when you ask clients what they were feeling, they answer with a feeling word. However, Suzanne\nrepeated her initial response. Her therapist thought that Suzanne needed more guidance.\nTherapist: Well, feelings are usually expressed in one word. While there are many feelings, it would\nbe helpful to ask yourself whether you were feeling happy, mad, sad, anxious, guilty,\nashamed, or any other feeling.\nSuzanne: Oh that\u2019s easy, I was really nervous and worried, and I think also embarrassed.\nGiving Suzanne the basic list of feelings helped her start to identify her own feelings.\n[Page 103]\n92 CBT Made Simple\nHELP YOUR CLIENTS RATE THEIR FEELINGS\nIn CBT, we often ask our clients to rate the intensity of their feelings. At first it can feel strange to\nask your client to rate his feelings; however, it is very helpful. You are asking your client to reflect on his\nfeelings rather than automatically respond to them. Here is an example of how rating his feelings\nhelped one of my clients. He was a man in his late forties who had intense anxiety attacks at work and\nwould subsequently become immobilized for the whole day. A few weeks after we had started working\ntogether, he came in smiling and said, \u201cI had one of my anxiety attacks at work last week, but I rated\nmy anxiety, and I realized it was only a 7. So I kept on working and it went away.\u201d Rating his feelings\nhelped my client get a different perspective on his feelings.\nI usually ask clients to first identify and label their feelings and then to rate their feelings. I say,\nYou did a good job identifying your feelings. (Notice I am reinforcing my client for a specific task.)\nBefore we move on, I would like to ask you to look at each feeling you identified and rate how\nstrongly you had this feeling from 1 to 10. Ten would be the strongest you have ever felt this\nfeeling and 1 would be not having the feeling at all. Rating your feelings can help us get a better\nunderstanding of how you are feeling. Would you be willing to try?\nYOUR TURN!\nHelp Suzanne Rate Her Feelings\nLet\u2019s go back to the situation where Suzanne was invited to the principal\u2019s barbecue. Imagine that\nSuzanne has just identified her feelings. You now want to help Suzanne rate the intensity of her\nfeelings.\nTherapist: When you received the invitation to the barbecue, what were your feelings?\nSuzanne: Oh that\u2019s easy, I was really nervous and worried, and I think also embarrassed.\nTherapist: You just did a really good job of identifying your feelings. (Note how the therapist\nis giving specific feedback on a task.)\nLook at the three possible responses below and pick the one that will help Suzanne rate her\nfeelings.\n1. Can you tell me what you are nervous about?\n2. I think it would be helpful if you could look at each feeling and rate how strongly you felt, from\n1 to 10. Ten is the strongest you have ever felt this feeling, and 1 is not at all. Would you be\nwilling to try?\n3. Lots of people are nervous when they are invited to a party. It\u2019s a very normal reaction.\nResponse #2 is the most likely to help Suzanne rate her feelings. It clearly explains what the therapist\nwould like her to do. Response #1 starts to explore the thoughts that go with the feeling of being\n[Page 104]\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Feelings, Physical Reactions, and Behaviors 93\nnervous. It is too early in therapy to identify thoughts, as you have not finished identifying and rating\nfeelings. Response #3 is a supportive comment, but it does not help Suzanne rate her feelings.\nTherapist: I think it would be helpful if you could look at each feeling and rate how strongly\nyou feel it, from 1 to 10. Ten is the strongest you have ever felt this feeling, and 1\nis not at all. Would you be willing to try?\nSuzanne: Well sure. Where do I start?\nLook at the three possible responses below and pick the one you think will help Suzanne start to\nrate her feelings.\n1. Where would you like to start?\n2. I can tell you really want to get better, which is very important. Learning about our feelings is\na key part to getting better.\n3. Why don\u2019t we start with the first feeling you listed, which was \u201cnervous.\u201d When you think of\nthe invitation, 1 to 10, how nervous are you?\nSuzanne is asking for guidance on how to rate her feelings. Response #3 is the most likely to help\nSuzanne start to rate her feelings. It clearly explains what the therapist would like Suzanne to do.\nResponses #1 and #2 don\u2019t address Suzanne\u2019s question, \u201cWhere do I start?\u201d\nSuzanne and her therapist rate all of her feelings. Before filling in the Understand Your Reaction\nworksheet, her therapist says, \u201cYou did a good job of rating your feelings. Just to summarize, you were\nnervous at a 7, and worried at an 8, and embarrassed at a 6. Is that right? Can we write it down?\u201d Notice\nthat the therapist makes a summary statement and then explains that she wants to fill in the worksheet. This keeps therapy organized. Below is how Suzanne recorded her responses on the Understand\nYour Reaction worksheet.\nUnderstand Your Reaction\nSituation Feelings Physical Behaviors Thoughts\nReactions\n(Rate 1\u201310)\n(Rate 1\u201310)\nWhat?

Plus, a client can misinterpret his physical symptoms, leading to emotional distress or dysfunctional behaviors. For example, a client may assume that\nif his heart is pounding he is having a heart attack or it is dangerous for his health. He becomes very\nanxious and starts to avoid situations where his heart pounds. In reality, his pounding heart is related\nto too much coffee or another issue and is not dangerous. Unless your client is able to identify his physical reactions, you can\u2019t explore what these physical reactions mean to him.\nWhile some clients are very aware of their physical reactions, other clients are unaware. The easiest\nway to identify your client\u2019s physical reactions is to simply ask, \u201cHow did your body react?\u201d or, \u201cWhat\nwere you feeling in your body?\u201d\nIf you are working with a client who has difficulty identifying his feelings, it can be helpful to start\nwith identifying his physical reactions, and then move on to identifying feelings. Often specific physical\nreactions go with specific feelings. For example, Raoul discovered that when he felt angry he was hot,\nwhen he felt anxious he was shaky, and when he felt sad he had a lump in his throat. As he learned to\nrelate his physical symptoms to his feelings, it became easier for Raoul to identify his feelings. When\nyour client identifies his physical reactions, it encourages self-reflection and helps him hit the pause\nbutton and stop zooming down the path of his automatic negative reaction.\nSuzanne\u2019s therapist asked her to identify the physical reactions that went with her feelings about\nbeing invited to the barbecue. Suzanne indicated that she got a clenched stomach and felt tense in\nher shoulders. She rated her clenched stomach at about a 4 and her tense shoulders at about a 5. She\nwas surprised at how low her ratings were. Often when my clients rate their physical reactions, they\nrealize that they are not as strong as they had thought. If, on the other hand, the physical reactions\nare very strong, this suggests you may want to teach your client specific skills to manage his physical\nsymptoms.\nThis coming week, try to notice any increase in your own physical tension. Ask yourself what you\nwere feeling and what you were thinking. See if you learn anything.\nAgenda Item #6: Help Your Clients Identify Their Behavior\nNext you want to identify your client\u2019s behavior. I usually simply ask, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I am\nlooking for behaviors that indicate that my client is avoiding a situation, acting impulsively, or behaving\nin a way that is likely to make the situation worse. For some clients, when you slow down and help them\nspecify what they did, it is a first step in acknowledging their problematic behavior and taking responsibility for their actions. A client of mine, Connor, had difficulty controlling his anger and tended to\nminimize his angry outbursts. He was describing how angry he was at his friend for not repaying a\nminor debt. He initially described his behavior as \u201cletting off some steam.\u201d When I asked what he had\ndone, he sheepishly told me that he kicked a door so hard that he smashed the glass insert. Connor\nwent on to blame his friend for not paying the debt and making him so angry that he kicked the door.\nWhen we looked at his behavior, Connor could see that his friend had not \u201cmade\u201d him kick the door,\nand that kicking a door so hard that he broke the glass insert was not just \u201cletting off steam.\u201d\n[Page 106]\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Feelings, Physical Reactions, and Behaviors 95\nTo really understand your client\u2019s behavior, you want a description of his behavior that is specific\nand concrete, like Connor\u2019s. This way, you can examine the consequences of the behavior and the\nappropriateness of the response. Clients often initially use a vague descriptor, such as \u201cI just gave up\u201d\nor \u201cI freaked out.\u201d It is important to ask what your client actually did.\nHere are some examples of vague descriptions of behavior and specific descriptions of the same\nbehavior. You want to know what your client did, whom he did the behavior with or to, where he was,\nand when it happened.\nExamples of Vague and Specific Behaviors\nSituation Vague Behavior Specific Behavior\nMy father told me I should not I withdrew.

This is a question many of my\nclients have never asked themselves. It is important to look at both short-term and long-term consequences. Often, avoiding dealing with a situation or having angry outbursts has relatively positive\nshort-term consequences but very negative long-term consequences, which many clients have never\nconsidered.\nLet\u2019s return to Suzanne\u2019s invitation. Her therapist wants to identify her behavior and asks Suzanne\nhow she had responded to the invitation. Suzanne said, \u201cI just got it three days ago and I\u2019m not sure\nwhat to do.\u201d\nAsk yourself if you know what her behavior is. You don\u2019t really know. It seems that her behavior is\nthat she has not responded to the invitation, but you need to check. Given that it has been three days,\n[Page 107]\n96 CBT Made Simple\nI would guess that Suzanne is avoiding dealing with the invitation. Is her statement \u201cI\u2019m not sure what\nto do\u201d a behavior, feeling, physical reaction, or thought? (Try to answer before reading on.) It is a\nthought. At this point I would notice the thought but not comment on it, as we are concentrating on\nher behavior. Remember, you want to stay organized. I put that thought in my back pocket, so when I\nask Suzanne to identify her thoughts, if she does not mention \u201cI\u2019m not sure what to do,\u201d I have it in\nreserve and can take it out at the right moment.\nBelow is a summary of what we know about Suzanne\u2019s reaction to the invitation from the principal.\nWe don\u2019t yet know Suzanne\u2019s thoughts, but we will cover that in the next chapter.\nUnderstand Your Reaction\nSituation Feelings Physical Behaviors Thoughts\nReactions\n(Rate 1\u201310)\n(Rate 1\u201310)\nWhat?

A good summary\nstatement can be very simple. It\u2019s as if you are holding up a mirror that helps your clients look at themselves. When you summarize, you also let your clients know that you heard them. Let\u2019s try one. Your\nclient starts a session saying, \u201cI am not sure which situation I want to focus on. First, the whole party\nwas a disaster. My three-year-old child screamed and cried most of the night; at the end of the evening,\nmy husband told me he never wants to have another party. Second, work has been awful this week,\nonce again my boss ignored my comments at a meeting; and third, to top it all off, my husband got\nreally drunk again.\u201d How could you summarize what your client just said? One way is to simply say, \u201cIt\n[Page 108]\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Feelings, Physical Reactions, and Behaviors 97\nis hard to know what to focus on, since so much happened. Should we talk about the party, what\u2019s been\nhappening at work with your boss ignoring your comments, or your husband getting drunk again?\u201d The\nsummary helps your client pause and think about where she would like to start.\nEarlier we talked about open and closed questions. If you remember, closed questions can be\nanswered with either a single word or a short phrase. Examples of closed questions are \u201cDid you ask\nyour boss for a year-end evaluation?\u201d and \u201cDid you use cocaine over the weekend?\u201d Closed questions\ncan usually be answered with a yes or no, or with facts. Open questions ask people to think and talk\nabout their thoughts and feelings. Examples of open questions are \u201cHow did you feel after you asked\nyour boss for a raise?\u201d and \u201cWhen your friend offered you cocaine, what were your thoughts?\u201d As you\nuse the four-factor model as a structure to explore your client\u2019s reactions, remember to use summary\nstatements and open questions.\nHomework: Practice CBT\nBefore continuing with the next chapter, take some time to try the homework.\nApply What You Learned to a Clinical Example\nComplete the following exercises.\n\uf09d Exercise 5.1: Raoul\u2019s Boss Is Difficult\nExercise 5.2: Find the Facts\nExercise 5.3: Mary Treats Her Son Badly\nApply What You Learned to Your Own Life\nAfter you have completed the homework assignments below, pause and take a moment to think\nabout what you learned about yourself. Then, think about the implications of your experience with\nthese exercises for your therapy with clients.\nHomework Assignment #1\nDescribe a Specific and Concrete Situation\nThink of a situation in your own life where you would describe someone in a general, vague manner,\nsuch as, \u201cMy partner is self-centered,\u201d \u201cMy boss is unreasonable,\u201d or \u201cMy father is very frail.\u201d Now try\nto make the situation more concrete and specific. Think of a specific example and ask yourself, What\nhappened? Who was in the situation? Where did it happen? and When did it happen?\nWhat did you learn from specifying the situation? Did it make a difference?\n[Page 109]\n98 CBT Made Simple\nHomework Assignment #2\nDescribe a Specific and Concrete Behavior\nThink of a behavior that you either like or dislike about yourself and that is a vague description. For\nexample, are you messy, kind, organized, thoughtful, ambitious, easygoing, or easily distracted? Now try\nto think of a specific example of this behavior and describe your behavior in a more specific and concrete manner. What was the impact of giving a specific description of your behavior?\nHomework Assignment #3\nRate Your Own Feelings\nOften my students are skeptical about the benefit of rating feelings until they try it for themselves. This\ncoming week, pick three different situations. At least one should be a situation that upset you. Try to\nfirst identify your feelings. You may have only one feeling, but you may have many. Remember: if you\nhave trouble identifying your feelings, ask yourself if you felt happy, mad, sad, anxious, guilty, or\nashamed. You may also have lots of other feelings. Once you have identified your feelings, rate each\none. Complete the chart below. Did rating your feelings make a difference? What did you learn?\nIdentify Three Situations Identify Your Feelings in Each Situation\nand Rate Each Feeling from 1\u201310\n(1 = not at all, 10 = the strongest you have\never had this feeling)\n[Page 110]\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Feelings, Physical Reactions, and Behaviors 99\nApply What You Learned to Your Therapy Practice\nIt is now time to start using the Understand Your Reaction worksheet. Don\u2019t worry if it feels\nawkward at first; it is important to try.\nHomework Assignment #4\nUse the Understand Your Reaction Worksheet with a Client\nChoose a current client you think would benefit from and like using the Understand Your Reaction\nworksheet. Then complete the steps below.\nStep 1: Ask your client to identify a specific situation that he wants to work on. Be sure to ask What\nhappened? Who was involved? Where did it happen? and When did it happen?\nStep 2: Explain that you want to understand the situation using the four-factor model, and show your\nclient the Understand Your Reaction worksheet.\nStep 3: Ask about your client\u2019s feelings and have your client rate their intensity from 1 to 10.\nStep 4: Ask about your client\u2019s physical reactions and have your client rate their intensity from 1 to 10.\nStep 5: Ask about your client\u2019s behavior.\nComplete the worksheet with your client. If it is the first time you are trying to use the four-factor\nmodel with a client, you may feel awkward, and it may not go smoothly. But that\u2019s okay! Think of the\nfirst time you rode a bike, drove a car, tried to swim, or cooked a turkey. If you are like most people, you\nwere unsure how to do it. The more you practiced, the better you got. Think of me cheering you on.\nRemember that the goal of homework is not to do it well, but to try.\n[Page 111]\n100 CBT Made Simple\nnoitcaeR\nruoY\ndnatsrednU\nsthguohT\nsroivaheB\nsnoitcaeR\nlacisyhP\nsgnileeF\nnoitautiS\n)01\u20131\netaR(\n)01\u20131\netaR(\n?kniht\nI\ndid\ntahW\n?od\nI\ndid\ntahW\nydob\nym\ndid\nwoH\n?leef\nI\ndid\ntahW\n?ohW\n?tahW\n?tcaer\n?nehW\n?erehW\n[Page 112]\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Feelings, Physical Reactions, and Behaviors 101\nLet\u2019s Review\nAnswer the questions under the agenda items.\nAgenda Item #1: Use the four-factor model in therapy.\n\u2022 How can you use the four-factor model in therapy?\nAgenda Item #2: Identify your clients\u2019 triggers.\n\u2022 What are four questions you could use to specify your client\u2019s trigger situation?\nAgenda Item #3: Understand your clients\u2019 reactions.\n\u2022 How could you introduce using the four factors to understand your client\u2019s reaction?\nAgenda Item #4: Help your clients identify their feelings.\n\u2022 How could you explain a feeling?\n\u2022 Is \u201cI feel like a failure\u201d a feeling or a thought?\nAgenda Item #5: Help your clients identify their physical reactions.\n\u2022 What is a good question to identify your clients\u2019 physical reactions?\nAgenda Item#6: Help your clients identify their behaviors.\n\u2022 Your client says, \u201cI want to punch him in the face.\u201d Is this a behavior?

Did you have a chance to try the homework? Did you try asking\nyour client about his or her feelings, physical reactions, or behaviors? Take a moment to reflect on what\nyou learned from completing the homework.\nIf you did not do the homework, can you identify the obstacles that got in the way? Before you read\nthis chapter, take a moment to think about an upsetting experience that happened last week. Then\nidentify your feelings, physical reactions, and behaviors.\nDon\u2019t forget about structuring your sessions. Are you setting agendas and reviewing at the end? If\nyou have not been using a structured session, try setting an agenda with just one client this coming\nweek.\nSet the Agenda\nThe next two chapters focus on how to help your clients identify their thoughts. In this chapter we will\ncover how to decide which thoughts are worth working on. We will call these thoughts hot thoughts.\nIn the next chapter we will cover how to identify hot thoughts.\nAgenda Item #1: Identify hot thoughts.\nAgenda Item #2: Is this thought an unrealistic evaluation of self, others, or the future?\nAgenda Item #3: Does this thought explain your client\u2019s feelings?\nAgenda Item #4: Does this thought contain a cognitive distortion?\n[Page 114]\nMy Clients Have So Many Thoughts\u2014Which Do I Focus On? 103\nWork the Agenda\nIn CBT you are going to spend a lot of time and effort helping your clients identify and examine their\nthoughts. You want to be sure that time is well spent. We all have a continual stream of thoughts that\ngo through our head every day, and not every thought is worth working on. You want to target thoughts\nthat are central to your client\u2019s distress and which, when targeted, will lead to meaningful change.\nAgenda Item #1: Identify Hot Thoughts\nThoughts that are worth working on explain the meaning of the situation and are strongly connected to intense feelings. We call these hot thoughts (Safran, Vallis, Segal, & Shaw, 1986) because they\ncarry emotion, and when we work with them in therapy there is meaningful change.\nHere is an example. Jaylen\u2019s father lives six hours away. He calls Jaylen once a week and always\nstarts the conversation by sighing and saying, \u201cI never see you. When will you come visit? I miss you.\u201d\nEvery week his father\u2019s phone call triggers the same negative automatic thoughts: My father has called\nevery week for the past two years. He is always critical. He does not appreciate what I do for him. Let\u2019s look\nat Jaylen\u2019s thoughts and identify which ones are hot thoughts. The thought My father has called every\nweek for the past two years is a fact; it does not explain what his father\u2019s phone call means to Jaylen or\nthe reason for Jaylen\u2019s emotional distress. It is not a hot thought. The thoughts He is always critical and\nHe does not appreciate what I do for him are hot thoughts because they capture what his father\u2019s words\nmean to him and explain Jaylen\u2019s emotional reaction.\nWhen you are first learning CBT, it can be hard to know which thoughts are hot thoughts and\nworth focusing on. In this chapter we are going to look at three guidelines to help you identify a hot\nthought. Remember, a hot thought has to capture the meaning of the situation and is related to intense\nfeelings. Below are the three guidelines.\n1. Is this thought an unrealistic evaluation of self, others, or the future?\n2. Does this thought explain your client\u2019s feelings?\n3. Does this thought contain a cognitive distortion?\nAgenda Item #2: Is This Thought an Unrealistic Evaluation\nof Self, Others, or the Future?\nIt is your client\u2019s unrealistic thoughts about self, others, or the future that capture the meaning of\na situation and help you understand her distress.\nSometimes it is easier to understand a concept if we start with an example. A client of mine,\nRegina, was recently fired from a job and was feeling very depressed and anxious. When I asked what\nshe was thinking, she responded, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I was fired\u201d and \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t been fired.\u201d These\nthoughts do not explain what being fired means to Regina, so they are not hot thoughts. I asked additional questions and we identified the following thoughts:\n[Page 115]\n104 CBT Made Simple\nEvaluation of self (thoughts that are a judgment about yourself)\n\u2022 I am too old to learn another skill.\n\u2022 Something is wrong with me.\n\u2022 I am stupid.\nTry to think of a negative evaluation that you have of yourself, or that one of your clients has of herself.\nEvaluation of others (thoughts that are a judgment about other people or an expectation about how\nother people will treat you)\n\u2022 My boss is unfair.\n\u2022 My father will be disappointed.\n\u2022 None of my colleagues cares about me.\nTry to think of a negative evaluation that you have of other people, or that one of your clients has of others.\nEvaluation of the future (thoughts that are a judgment of the future or an expectation of what the\nfuture will be like)\n\u2022 My friends and partner will no longer respect me (this is both about others and the future).\n\u2022 I will be poor and lose my house.\n\u2022 I will never get another job that is as good.\nTry to think of a negative evaluation that you have of the future, or that one of your clients has of the\nfuture.\nWhen you look at the thoughts that Regina identified about self, others, and the future, can you\nsee how they explain what getting fired meant to Regina and why these thoughts would lead to her\nfeeling depressed and anxious?\nLet\u2019s look more closely at how to identify thoughts about self, as they can sometimes be hard to\nidentify. Some thoughts are clearly about the self, for example, I made a serious mistake, or I am disorganized. However, sometimes negative thoughts about self are hidden in thoughts about others and in\nparticular thoughts about how others treat you. Let\u2019s take the thought My colleague never asks my\nopinion. You could believe this is the case because your colleague is unpleasant and bossy (thought\nabout others), but you believe that you have good ideas (thought about self). In this case, the negative\njudgment is about your colleague and there are no negative judgments about yourself. However, you\ncould believe that your colleague never asks your opinion because she thinks you do not have good\nideas, and you think this as well. In this case, you have a negative judgment about your colleague, but\nyou also have a negative judgment about yourself.\n[Page 116]\nMy Clients Have So Many Thoughts\u2014Which Do I Focus On? 105\nHere are some more examples of thoughts about others where there may be hidden negative beliefs\nabout self: None of my new colleagues would want to be my friend, No one would want to help me, and No\none will ever want to stay married to me. In all these situations, your client may believe that there is\nsomething about her that causes the other person\u2019s negative behavior. For example, a client might\nthink, None of my new colleagues would want to be my friend because I am too shy and boring. \u201cI am too\nshy and boring\u201d is a negative thought about self. A client could also think none of her new colleagues\nwants to be her friend because they are all close to retirement and are not interested in making new\nfriends at work. In this case, there is no underlying negative evaluation of self. You can check whether\nthere is an underlying negative evaluation of self by asking your client, \u201cIs there something about you\nthat would cause the other person to treat you this way?\u201d\nYour Turn!\nIdentify Suzanne\u2019s Thoughts about Self, Others, and the Future\nIn their fourth session, Suzanne wanted to talk about how upset she was with her husband. She describes\na recent fight. A few nights ago her husband was watching TV when she asked him if he had bathed\nAndrew, their four-year-old son. He responded by saying, \u201cI\u2019m exhausted, can you do it?\u201d Suzanne blew\nup at him, yelled that he had promised to give their son a bath and that he was selfish, and then\nstomped out of the room. She is feeling depressed and hopeless. Her therapist wants to understand the\nthoughts that caused her to become so upset. Another way of thinking about it is, what did it mean to\nSuzanne that her husband did not give Andrew a bath and said, \u201cCan you do it?\u201d\nLook over the dialogue and list Suzanne\u2019s thoughts. Then decide if the thought is a fact or an\nevaluation of self, others, or the future. You can find my answers in the appendix.\nTherapist: W hat were you thinking when you realized your husband did not give Andrew\nhis bath and said, \u201cI\u2019m exhausted, can you do it?\u201d\nSuzanne: I just keep thinking that he didn\u2019t give Andrew his bath; no matter what I do, it\nwon\u2019t make a difference.\nTherapist: Any other thoughts?\nSuzanne: H e doesn\u2019t care about the kids or me. Besides, you can\u2019t count on men.\nTherapist: Can you tell me more about those thoughts?\nSuzanne: I keep thinking that I\u2019m a completely inadequate mother; I keep asking myself,\nWhy do I have to do everything in the house?\nTherapist: A lot of thoughts, any others?\nSuzanne: No, that\u2019s probably all; it\u2019s enough!\n[Page 117]\n106 CBT Made Simple\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 6.1: (a) Jim Forgets His Wallet, and (b) Richard\u2019s Boyfriend\nWants to End the Relationship\nPractice identifying thoughts about self, others, or the future.\nAgenda Item #3: Does This Thought Explain Your\nClient\u2019s Feelings?\nThe second guideline for evaluating whether your client has identified her hot thoughts is examining whether her thoughts explain her feelings, and in particular her strong negative feelings. What do\nI mean by this? Given your client\u2019s thoughts, the feelings have to make sense, and the intensity of the\nfeeling has to make sense. Let\u2019s look at an example.\nA client of mine, Angela, was concerned about her new babysitting arrangements. When her\ntherapist asks about the situation, Angela explains that when she left her daughter with the new babysitter, her daughter cried and begged Angela not to leave. This is unusual behavior for her daughter,\nwho loved her previous sitter and usually played happily when Angela left her with the sitter in the\nmorning. Angela is feeling very guilty (8) and anxious (8\u20139). When asked about her thoughts, Angela\nresponded, \u201cMy daughter is probably upset because it is a new sitter. She will just have to get used to\nher. It will take time.\u201d\nThese are very good coping thoughts; however, they don\u2019t help us understand Angela\u2019s feelings. If\nshe really believed these thoughts, and she had no others, would she feel guilty at 8 and anxious at 8 to\n9? Probably not. Given the strength of her anxiety and guilt, there are probably some other thoughts\nthat Angela is not aware of. Had Angela\u2019s feelings been \u201cslightly sad,\u201d these thoughts would have made\nsense.\nWhen your client\u2019s thoughts don\u2019t match her feelings, this is a sign that you need to keep exploring\nto identify the underlying thoughts. We will get to how you can help your clients identify their underlying thoughts in the next chapter.\nDifferent feelings have different types of accompanying thoughts. In CBT we call this content specificity (Beck et al., 1979). Let\u2019s look at the kind of thoughts that go with anxiety, depression, anger, guilt,\nand shame. Take a moment and think of the last time that you were anxious, and then focus on the\nfeeling. What thoughts accompany this feeling of anxiety? Jot down your thoughts. Now do the same\nfor depression, anger, guilt, and shame. See whether your own thoughts fit with the descriptions below.\nHOW TO UNDERSTAND ANXIETY\nThoughts that accompany anxiety are about a future threat that you think will have awful consequences, is likely to occur, and you don\u2019t think you can handle. Figure 6.1 shows how you can think of\nanxiety as an equation.\n[Page 118]\nMy Clients Have So Many Thoughts\u2014Which Do I Focus On? 107\nOverestimate Overestimate Underestimate\nDanger or Likelihood of Your ability to\n+ +\nAnxiety =\nd i f f i c u l t y o f situation cope\nsituation occurring\nFigure 6.1. Understand anxiety.\nIf you think you can handle the threat, it becomes a challenge. Kendall et al. (2002), in their treatment program for anxious adolescents, describe anxiety as \u201cexpecting bad things to happen.\u201d I find this\na very helpful way to think about anxiety. If your client is feeling anxious, nervous, or worried, make\nsure you understand what \u201cbad thing\u201d your client is expecting to happen. For example, in the case of\nAngela leaving her child with the sitter, you could say, \u201cI hear even though you are worried, you tell\nyourself it will be all right, but I wonder, what are you worried will happen?\u201d\nHOW TO UNDERSTAND DEPRESSION\nDepression is about loss and hopelessness. Usually when your clients are depressed, they have negative thoughts about themselves, others, and the future. Below are the kinds of thoughts you would\nexpect someone who is depressed to have.\nThoughts about Self\n\u2022 I am inadequate.\n\u2022 I am ugly.\n\u2022 I am a bad friend.\n\u2022 I am a bad parent.\n\u2022 I am bad at sports (or work or school).\n\u2022 Nothing I do is any good.\nThoughts about Others\n\u2022 No one likes me.\n\u2022 My kids don\u2019t care about me.\n\u2022 My colleagues think my work is no good.\n\u2022 My partner thinks I am a burden.\n[Page 119]\n108 CBT Made Simple\nThoughts about the Future\n\u2022 Nothing will ever change.\n\u2022 I will never have any friends.\n\u2022 I will never get another job.\nOften depression is precipitated by a loss. It could be the loss of a relationship, the loss of health,\nthe loss of a job, or another loss. Clients who are depressed believe that the future without what they\nhave lost is bleak and hopeless.\nHOW TO UNDERSTAND ANGER\nThoughts that accompany anger usually have to do with the belief that the client or someone he\ncares about has been treated unfairly. Angry thoughts are usually directed at other people. Generally,\nthe person who is angry feels disempowered, disrespected, or put down and reacts with anger. Thoughts\nthat include \u201cshould statements\u201d are very common. With anger there is a belief that the rules of how\nthe world should be have been broken to the client\u2019s disadvantage.\nAnger is a complex feeling. Sometimes people have only angry feelings, especially if they believe\nthat they have been unjustly wronged. However, anger is closely related to depression and hopelessness.\nIf you believe you have been unjustly wronged and you believe that there is nothing you can do, you\ncan easily become depressed. Some clients label all feelings as anger, and it can be very useful to help\nthem recognize their other feelings.\nHOW TO UNDERSTAND GUILT AND SHAME\nGuilt and shame often go together. When we feel guilty, we believe that we have done something\nwrong and broken an important moral rule. Guilt is often related to believing that we have hurt\nsomeone. When we feel guilty, we feel responsible, and we tell ourselves that we should have behaved\ndifferently. Shame is closely related, as it is also connected to believing that we have broken an important rule, but we believe that because we have broken that rule, we are somehow flawed or awful. When\nwe are ashamed, we often hide what we are ashamed about and believe we would be rejected if people\nknew the \u201creal me.\u201d\nIt is helpful to ask your client to specify what he did that is so terrible that he feels guilty or\nashamed. Often, this is the first time that a client has articulated what it is he did. Once you have a\nclear idea what your client did, you can start to examine how terrible it really was.\nHOW INTENSE IS THE FEELING?\nWe have talked about the types of thoughts that you would expect to accompany specific feelings.\nWe also expect thoughts to match the intensity of the feeling. For example, a client rates her anger at\na 2 out of 10, and her thought was, I can\u2019t stand my boss; he humiliates me every chance he gets. Given her\nthoughts, would you expect her anger to be stronger than a 2? I would. What if a client rates her disappointment at an 8 and her thought is, I wish I had not sprained my ankle, but even if I can\u2019t play I can still\n[Page 120]\nMy Clients Have So Many Thoughts\u2014Which Do I Focus On? 109\nenjoy watching the basketball game. Do you think the thought and rating go together? I don\u2019t. Either the\nrating is too strong, or the client has additional thoughts that you need to identify.\nYour Turn!\nWhat Thoughts Go with These Feelings?\nBelow are three situations. For each situation there are three possible thoughts the client might have.\nChoose the thought that is most likely to go with the feeling. You can find my answers in the\nappendix.\n1. Cameron\u2019s college hockey team was in the state semi-final. The score was tied. Cameron had\nthe puck and was sure he would score, when another player knocked him over. Cameron is\nfeeling furious. What might he be thinking?\n\u2022 Our team will never have another chance to play in the semi-finals.\n\u2022 That guy is an animal; he should be punished; it\u2019s unfair.\n\u2022 If we lose, it is all my fault.\n2. Annette just heard that she was the second-choice candidate for a job she had applied for.\nAnnette is feeling disappointed. What might she be thinking?\n\u2022 I will never get a decent job; my life is over.\n\u2022 They should have hired me; what idiots!\n\u2022 I had hoped to get the job, but at least I was second choice.\n3. Orly did not visit his best friend, Roy, when Roy was in the hospital for two weeks. Orly is\nfeeling guilty. What might he be thinking?\n\u2022 I am a bad friend; I should have gone; I bet I hurt Roy\u2019s feelings.\n\u2022 My friend is probably furious at me.\n\u2022 I bet Roy will not want to be my friend anymore.\nAgenda Item #4: Does This Thought Contain a\nCognitive Distortion?\nThe term cognitive distortion is commonly used in the CBT literature and is familiar to many therapists. However, I don\u2019t really like it. I think the term distorted suggests that the therapist is negatively\n[Page 121]\n110 CBT Made Simple\njudging the client\u2019s thoughts. McKay, Davis, and Fanning (2011) have used the term patterns of limited\nthinking, which I prefer. In my own clinical practice, I often use the term thinking traps because there is\nan inherent assumption that you can avoid a trap. I also like the term thinking style. However, for the\npurpose of this discussion, I\u2019ll stick to the common term cognitive distortions.\nCognitive distortions are how your clients typically respond to situations that trigger them. You\ncan think of cognitive distortions as a label for your clients\u2019 negative thinking patterns. Initially, psychologists identified only a few specific distortions. Over time, the list of cognitive distortions has\nexpanded to the point that many therapists and clients find them confusing and hard to use. It is\nimportant not to get lost in a long list. The purpose of identifying a client\u2019s cognitive distortions is to\nhave a label that a client feels captures his experience. Labeling a negative thinking pattern is another\nway of hitting the pause button on automatic negative reactions. When a client labels a thought as a\ncognitive distortion, he is also questioning the accuracy of his thoughts.\nBelow is a list of the most common cognitive distortions. I also have included in italics a number\nof shorthand ways of describing the cognitive distortions, which were inspired by Kendall and his colleagues (2002) and Stallard (2005). For each cognitive distortion, I have included an example from one\nof my clients. (Full disclosure\u2014I snuck in one or two examples from my own life!) A Thinking Traps\nhandout can be downloaded at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\nThinking Traps\nFiltering: Focusing on the negative details of the situation while other positive aspects are ignored.\nNegative glasses or walking with blinders: You only see negative things.\nExample: A student has consistently received A\u2019s in a course. On a small quiz, the student receives\na C+ and immediately assumes she\u2019s doing poorly in the course.\nOvergeneralizing: You make a broad generalization, which is based on only one piece of usually negative evidence.\nThe repetitor: It happened once; it will always be that way.\nExample: Since I found out that my last boyfriend cheated on me, I can never trust another man\nagain.\nAll-or-Nothing Thinking or Black-and-White Thinking: You or others are either right or wrong,\ngood or bad, perfect or a failure. There is no room for grays or middle ground in evaluating yourself or\nothers.\nExamples:\n\u2022 The world is made up of winners and losers, and I sure don\u2019t want to be one of those losers.\n\u2022 If it is not done perfectly, it is not worth doing at all.\n\u2022 My employee missed a small deadline\u2014he\u2019s completely useless!\n[Page 122]\nMy Clients Have So Many Thoughts\u2014Which Do I Focus On? 111\nMind Reading/Making Assumptions: You assume that you know what people are feeling and thinking and why they are acting that way.\nMind readers and fortune tellers: Knowing that things will go wrong.\nExamples:\n\u2022 My boss didn\u2019t say anything about my last report; I know he thought it was terrible.\n\u2022 My partner gave me a funny look; I know she disapproved of what I said.\nPersonalizing: You assume that what people are saying or doing is about you, even though there is no\nindication of that. Another aspect is that you often compare yourself to others, trying to determine how\nyou measure up in a variety of attributes, such as intelligence, competence, or appearance.\nExample: In the meeting when Mary said that some people have not been pulling their weight on\nthis project, I know that she was talking about me.\nCatastrophizing: You assume disaster will occur. Sometimes it is related to an initial difficulty.\nCatastrophic thoughts often start with \u201cwhat if.\u201d For example, your child borrowed the car to go to a\nparty and comes home fifteen minutes late. You think, What if he had an accident? What if the car broke\ndown?\nBlowing things up: Negative things become bigger than they really are.\nExamples:\n\u2022 Since my son came home slightly drunk the other night, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s on his way to becoming an alcoholic like his uncle; it will ruin his life.\n\u2022 I lost my job; we will have to sell the house; I destroyed my whole family.\nPredicting the Future: In many ways, predicting the future is similar to catastrophizing, if the prediction is negative. However, individuals who engage in dysfunctional behavior, or who avoid completing\nnecessary responsibilities, often falsely predict a positive or benign future.\nExample: I can handle my alcohol; seven beers a night is not too much for me.\nMagnifying and Minimizing: The degree or intensity of the problem is exaggerated so that anything\ndifficult is deemed overwhelming, and anything positive is ignored or minimized.\nPositive doesn\u2019t count: Throwing out the good things that happen.\nExample: A mother discovers that her son, who has schizophrenia, occasionally smokes marijuana.\nShe says, \u201cMy child is a failure; nothing he does works out.\u201d She ignores that he is also regularly\ntaking his medication, is no longer paranoid, and has a part-time job.\nShoulds: Individuals have a list of rules about how they and other people are expected to act, and they\nexperience it as terrible if these rules are broken. They feel angry if other people break the rules, and\nguilty if they themselves break the rules.\n[Page 123]\n112 CBT Made Simple\nExamples:\n\u2022 I should always be available to my children and husband.\n\u2022 I should always try my hardest.\n\u2022 I should be perfect at everything I do.\nIf a thought contains words that indicate extremes, such as \u201calways,\u201d \u201cnever,\u201d \u201ceveryone,\u201d or \u201cno\none,\u201d it is most likely a cognitive distortion, as the real world is not so absolute. When people use these\nterms, they are usually focusing only on the negative aspects of a situation and ignoring other information. This is especially true if the thought is accompanied by a strong emotional reaction. Let\u2019s look at\nsome examples:\nI always fail at everything I do.\nNo one will ever want to be my friend.\nEveryone hates me.\nI never do anything right.\nMy partner never helps me.\nIn the coming week, see if you can listen to your clients\u2019 thoughts and identify when they use terms\nsuch as \u201calways,\u201d \u201cnever,\u201d \u201ceveryone,\u201d or \u201cno one.\u201d\nYour Turn!\nIdentify the Cognitive Distortion\nBelow is a list of thoughts. See if you can identify the cognitive distortions. You will find my answers in\nthe appendix.\n1. If I don\u2019t get this job, my life will be over.\nCognitive distortion:\n2. To be a good therapist, you have to give it your all and be there for your clients 100 percent of\nthe time.\nCognitive distortion:\n3. I\u2019m sure that no one will ever want to hire me after this last fiasco of a job interview.\nCognitive distortion:\n[Page 124]\nMy Clients Have So Many Thoughts\u2014Which Do I Focus On? 113\n4. If I don\u2019t help all of my clients, I am an inadequate therapist.\nCognitive distortion:\n5. I know that my last client canceled because she thinks I\u2019m a bad therapist.\nCognitive distortion:\n6. A colleague told me he wondered if the group check-in should be a bit shorter next time. That\nwas a terrible mistake I made in the first group.\nCognitive distortion:\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 6.2: Julie Has a Terrible Week\nPractice listening for cognitive distortions as your client describes a problem.\nHELP YOUR CLIENTS IDENTIFY THEIR COGNITIVE DISTORTIONS\nAfter your client has identified her thoughts, it is helpful to explain cognitive distortions. I sometimes give my client the Thinking Traps handout with the definitions of the cognitive distortions. I\nexplain that these are common thinking styles that get people into trouble. I then ask my client to\nindicate whether she thinks any apply to her, and if so, to give me some examples from her own life. I\nmake sure to tell her that identifying her cognitive distortions is an important first step.\nIf my client is able to identify a cognitive distortion that she commonly uses, and if the exercise\nseems helpful to her, I then incorporate noticing cognitive distortions into her homework. I usually ask\nmy clients to record three situations where they caught themselves in a cognitive distortion and to\nrecord their response on the What Are My Thinking Traps? worksheet that follows, which you can\ndownload at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\n[Page 125]\n114 CBT Made Simple\nWhat Are My Thinking Traps?\nSituation Thoughts Thinking Trap (filtering;\novergeneralizing; all-ornothing thinking; mind\nreading; personalizing;\ncatastrophizing; predicting\nthe future; magnifying and\nminimizing; shoulds)\n[Page 126]\nMy Clients Have So Many Thoughts\u2014Which Do I Focus On? 115\nIDENTIFY YOUR CLIENTS\u2019 COGNITIVE DISTORTIONS BEFORE,\nDURING, AND AFTER A DYSFUNCTIONAL BEHAVIOR\nI often examine my client\u2019s cognitive distortions before, during, and after a dysfunctional behavior\nin order to understand what is maintaining the behavior. For example, Shula is diabetic. Despite having\ndifficulty controlling her blood sugar levels, she frequently eats sugary desserts. She tells her therapist,\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what is wrong with me; I have no willpower. I just end up having dessert.\u201d Let\u2019s see what\nwe discover when we examine her thoughts before, during, and after eating a dessert.\nShula Eats Dessert\nBefore/During/ Shula\u2019s Thoughts Cognitive Distortion\nAfter\nBefore Shula \u2022 I will just have one small bite. Minimizing and predicting the future\nEats Dessert\n\u2022 I had a hard day; I deserve it. Magnifying\n\u2022 If I say no I will insult my host, Mind reading and catastrophizing\nwho made the dessert.\nWhile Shula \u2022 As long as I have eaten a little All-or-nothing thinking\nEats Dessert sugar, I might as well have the\nwhole dessert.\n\u2022 It is too hard to keep to my eating Magnifying\nplan.\n\u2022 It doesn\u2019t matter if I eat some Minimizing\ndessert.\nAfter Shula \u2022 I am a loser. Black-and-white thinking\nEats Dessert\n\u2022 I will never get my diabetes under Predicting the future\ncontrol.\n[Page 127]\n116 CBT Made Simple\nOnce we examined Shula\u2019s thoughts before, during, and after she ate dessert, it made sense that she\nwas having so much trouble keeping to a healthy eating plan. Shula had been aware of her self-critical\nthoughts after she ate the dessert, but she had not been aware of her thoughts before and during, and the\nrole they played in maintaining her dessert eating.\nI have had clients who tell me they \u201cend up\u201d drinking until they black out, having unprotected sex,\nor not studying for exams. The reality is people don\u2019t \u201cend up\u201d doing these things. Even if it is fleeting,\nthere is almost always a thought before the behavior that enables or justifies the dysfunctional behavior.\nHelping your client identify her cognitive distortions before, during, and after dysfunctional behavior is\nan important step in helping her feel more in control and starting a change process.\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 6.3: Raymond Drinks Too Much\nPractice identifying cognitive distortions that occur before, during, and after your client\u2019s problematic behavior.\nHomework: Practice CBT\nBefore continuing with the next chapter, take some time to try the homework.\nApply What You Learned to a Clinical Example\nComplete the following exercises.\nExercise 6.1: (a) Jim Forgets His Wallet, and (b) Richard\u2019s Boyfriend Wants to End the\n\uf09d\nRelationship\nExercise 6.2: Julie Has a Terrible Week\nExercise 6.3: Raymond Drinks Too Much\nApply What You Learned to Your Own Life\nLook over the Thinking Traps handout for this homework assignment.\n[Page 128]\nMy Clients Have So Many Thoughts\u2014Which Do I Focus On? 117\nHomework Assignment #1\nIdentify Your Own Cognitive Distortions\nChoose one or two thinking traps that resonate with you and think of a recent example from your own\nlife for each one.

For example, most of us would like to exercise more, eat less junk food, or be\nmore organized. Choose one of these issues or a similar one. Next, think of a specific situation where\nyou had planned to exercise but didn\u2019t, or you ate the whole pack of potato chips when you had decided\nno more junk food, or instead of neatly filing your bills or reports you just left them in a pile on your\ndesk. Once you have chosen a specific situation, think back and try to identify what your thoughts were\nthat enabled you to not exercise, to eat the junk food, or to stick the paper onto the already messy pile\nof papers. Once you have identified your thought, try to identify the cognitive distortion.\nApply What You Learned to Your Therapy Practice\nNow that you\u2019ve had a chance to practice with your own thoughts, let\u2019s turn to your clients\u2019\nthoughts.\n[Page 130]\nMy Clients Have So Many Thoughts\u2014Which Do I Focus On? 119\nHomework Assignment #3\nTry Identifying Your Client\u2019s Thoughts about\nSelf, Others, or the Future\nDuring your next few therapy sessions, when a client spontaneously mentions a thought, ask yourself if\nthe thought is about self, others, or the future. Try to complete the worksheet below for three thoughts\nthat a client spontaneously mentions.\nAre My Client\u2019s Thoughts about Self,\nOthers, or the Future?\nClient Thought Self, Others, or Future?\n[Page 131]\n120 CBT Made Simple\nHomework Assignment #4\nHelp Your Clients Identify Their Thinking Traps\nChoose a client who often discloses his or her thoughts and who you think would find the idea of\nthinking traps helpful. Give him or her the Thinking Traps handout, which is available at http://www.\nnewharbinger.com/38501, and ask if any of the thinking traps apply. If this part of the exercise goes\nwell, ask your client to identify and write down three thoughts that are thinking traps this coming\nweek. You can use the What Are My Thinking Traps? worksheet.\nLet\u2019s Review\nAnswer the questions under the agenda items.\nAgenda Item #1: Identify hot thoughts.\n\u2022 What are two characteristics of hot thoughts?\nAgenda Item #2: Is this thought an unrealistic evaluation of self, others, or the future?\n\u2022 Why is it important to identify thoughts about self, others, or the future?\nAgenda Item #3: Does this thought explain your client\u2019s feelings?\n\u2022 What type of thoughts would you expect to go with depression, anxiety, anger, and guilt?\nAgenda Item #4: Does this thought contain a cognitive distortion?\n\u2022 Explain three cognitive distortions.\nWhat Was Important to You?\nWhat idea(s) or concept(s) would you like to remember?\nWhat idea(s) or skill(s) would you like to apply to your own life?\nWhat would you like to try this coming week with a client? (Choose a specific client.)\n[Page 132]\nCHAPTER 7\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Thoughts\nDid you have a chance to do the homework from the last chapter? Here is one of my catastrophizing\ncognitive distortions that I caught. I am in the car, driving to a meeting with colleagues I don\u2019t know\nvery well. I pick up coffee, and within five minutes I manage to spill a good part of it on my new white\nshirt. Can you guess my thoughts? I will look like a complete idiot; everyone will think I am totally incompetent. However, the truth is I simply pulled my jacket over my shirt\u2014and it wasn\u2019t great, but it certainly\nwasn\u2019t a catastrophe. Were you able to catch any of your own cognitive distortions? Were you able to\nidentify your clients\u2019 thoughts about self, others, or the future?\nIf you did the homework, take a moment to reflect on what you learned. If you did not do the\nhomework, think about an upsetting experience that happened last week. Identify your thoughts and\nthen ask yourself, Do my thoughts contain unrealistic judgments about self, others, or the future? Are they a\ncognitive distortion?\nSet the Agenda\nIn the last chapter we focused on how to decide which thoughts are worth working on. Now that we\nknow what to look for, it\u2019s time to get our hands dirty and learn how to look.\nAgenda Item #1: Identify automatic thoughts.\nAgenda Item #2: Helpful questions.\nAgenda Item #3: Your clients\u2019 images.\nAgenda Item #4: Additional strategies to identify thoughts.\nAgenda Item #5: How do you know which questions to use?\nAgenda Item #6: Link thoughts to feelings, physical reactions, and behavior.\n[Page 133]\n122 CBT Made Simple\nWork the Agenda\nRemember that the purpose of identifying your client\u2019s thoughts is to understand what a situation\nmeans to your client, or how he interpreted the situation. We want to help our clients identify their hot\nthoughts. To recap, a hot thought explains your client\u2019s feelings and behavior and is an unrealistically\nnegative evaluation of self, others, or the future.\nClients can have a variety of reactions when they start to identify their negative thoughts. Many\nclients feel more in control when they understand what is maintaining their difficulties and can identify the relationship between their thoughts, feelings, physical reactions, and behaviors. Other clients\nbecome more distressed when they realize how negative their thoughts really are. It is important to\nexplain that even though it can be hard to look at negative thoughts, it is a first step to feeling better.\nAgenda Item #1: Identify Automatic Thoughts\nIt sounds simple, but if you want to know what your client is thinking, just ask. The following \u201cJust\nAsk\u201d questions are often all that you need.\n\u201cJust Ask\u201d Questions\nGeneral Probing Questions \u2022 What were you thinking?\n\u2022 What were you saying to yourself at the time?\n\u2022 What was running through your mind?\nPrompting Questions \u2022 Any other thoughts?\n\u2022 Anything else?\nReflective Statements \u2022 So you were thinking\u2026(repeat last thought)\nOften just repeating the last thought or statement will encourage\nthe client to elaborate on more thoughts. You can then choose to\nadd a prompting question.\nClarifying Questions \u2022 Can you tell me more about that thought?\nWhen you ask your client, \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d use a gentle, curious tone that encourages\nself-reflection. It is often helpful to refer to the situation you are exploring. For example, Suzanne\u2019s\ntherapist asked, \u201cWhen you received the invitation to the barbecue, what were your thoughts?\u201d Don\u2019t\nforget to go slowly and give your client time. It can take a couple of questions before your client can\nidentify his thoughts.\nLet\u2019s look at the example we started working on with Suzanne in chapter 5. If you remember, the\nprincipal of her new school invited her to a barbecue with the other new teachers. You know about the\n[Page 134]\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Thoughts 123\nsituation (invitation to the barbecue), you already know her feelings (nervous, worried, and embarrassed), you know her physical reaction (clenched stomach and tense shoulders), and you know her\nbehavior (put the invitation aside and did not respond). You now want to identify Suzanne\u2019s thoughts,\nand in particular you want to help her identify her hot thoughts. Let\u2019s see what happens if her therapist\nuses the \u201cJust Ask\u201d questions.\nTherapist: Suzanne, you have done a good job identifying your feelings, physical reactions, and behavior. Let\u2019s see if we can also identify your thoughts. When you were invited to the party,\nwhat thoughts went through your mind?\nNotice her therapist starts by positively reinforcing Suzanne for identifying her feelings, physical reactions,\nand behavior. She then refers to the situation before asking a general probing question.\nSuzanne: (pausing) I don\u2019t know, just that I don\u2019t want to go; the other new teachers will all be there.\nThe thought I don\u2019t want to go is the behavior Suzanne wants to do. It is a fact. The thought All the\nother new teachers will be there is also a fact. These thoughts do not contain unrealistic judgments\nabout self, others, or the future; they do not explain her feelings; and they do not contain a cognitive distortion. Suzanne has not yet identified a hot thought.\nTherapist: Any other thoughts?\nThe therapist uses a prompting question.\nSuzanne: Well, just that I won\u2019t fit in.\nSuzanne is starting to identify her hot thoughts. I won\u2019t fit in is a thought about self. Her therapist wants\nto keep exploring.\nTherapist: Are there other thoughts that go with I won\u2019t fit in?\nThe therapist uses another prompting question.\nSuzanne: I feel that I will just stand there looking awkward, and no one will talk to me. I will be so\nanxious, and I will probably get all sweaty.\nThis is an example of a client using \u201cI feel,\u201d when what Suzanne really means is \u201cI think.\u201d When this\nhappens, simply repeat the sentence saying, \u201cYou were thinking,\u2026\u201d\nTherapist: You were thinking, I will just stand there looking awkward, no one will talk to me, and I will\nprobably get all sweaty.\nSuzanne: That\u2019s right, it\u2019s not just that they won\u2019t talk to me, it\u2019s that no one will want to talk to me.\nAt this point Suzanne has identified a thought about herself: I won\u2019t fit in; thoughts about herself and\nthe future: I will stand there looking awkward, and I will probably get all sweaty; and a thought\nabout others and the future: no one will want to talk to me.\nHer therapist then asked Suzanne if she would like to write down her thoughts on the Understand\nYour Reaction worksheet. Sometimes clients like to write, and sometimes they like me to write. I don\u2019t\n[Page 135]\n124 CBT Made Simple\nthink it matters. If I am writing, I repeat my client\u2019s thoughts out loud as I write. I find that this encourages my client to start thinking about his thoughts, rather than just experiencing them.\nLet\u2019s see what Suzanne\u2019s worksheet looks like.\nUnderstand Your Reaction\nSituation Feelings Physical Behaviors Thoughts\nReactions\n(Rate 1\u201310)\n(Rate 1\u201310)\nWhat?

For example, Raoul felt very awkward going to the lunchroom. When his therapist\nasked what he was thinking, he responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just feel awkward.\u201d His therapist needs to\nask additional questions to help Raoul identify his thoughts.\nWHAT DOES THE SITUATION MEAN TO YOUR CLIENT?\nOne way to discover what a situation means to your client is to ask him directly. You can use any\nof the following questions:\n\u2022 What does this situation mean to you?\n\u2022 What does this situation mean about you, other people, or the future?\n\u2022 What is it about this situation that is so distressing for you?\n[Page 136]\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Thoughts 125\n\u2022 How is this situation a problem for you?\nInitially, I felt very awkward using these questions. My clients had just told me about an emotionally difficult situation, and I was asking what it meant to them or why it was a problem. However, I have\nconsistently found these questions to be very helpful. Like all questions, it is important that you use a\ngentle, curious tone that conveys your desire to understand your client\u2019s experiences.\nLet\u2019s go back to Suzanne. Her therapist decided to keep exploring, using the additional questions\nidentified above, in order to be sure she fully understood why Suzanne found the invitation to the barbecue so distressing.\nTherapist: I want to be sure I understand what it is about the invitation to the barbecue that is so\ndistressing for you.\nSuzanne: It\u2019s not the invitation, it\u2019s going there with all the other new teachers.\nTherapist: What is it about being there with all the other new teachers that is so distressing for you?\nHer therapist uses one of the questions to keep probing what the situation means to Suzanne.\nSuzanne: It\u2019s hard to figure out. I guess that I won\u2019t fit in; (pausing) I think my biggest fear is that\nthey won\u2019t want to be my friend.\nTherapist: Sounds like the big fear is \u201cthey won\u2019t want to be my friend\u201d?\nSuzanne: That\u2019s right, that no one will want to be my friend, and I will be there all alone.\nIn the example above, the question \u201cWhat is it about this situation that is so distressing for you?\u201d\nhelped Suzanne figure out her underlying thought. Let\u2019s look at another example and see how you can\nuse these questions.\nYour Turn!\nWhat Does This Situation Mean to Suzanne?\nIn her fifth session, Suzanne wanted to focus on her feelings at recess. She was increasingly anxious and\nuncomfortable during recess duty and had been trying unsuccessfully to avoid it completely. Her therapist asked if Suzanne could give an example of what happens. Suzanne explained that she stands alone\nin the schoolyard, does not talk to anyone, and tries to look as if she is supervising the children. She\nfeels very lonely and wishes the other teachers would talk to her. Suzanne adds that this exact situation\nhappened yesterday. Her therapist believes this is a good situation to work with. She knows Suzanne\u2019s\nfeelings (anxious) and her behavior (she stands alone). She wants to understand Suzanne\u2019s thoughts.\nTherapist: When you are standing in the schoolyard at recess, what are you thinking?\nSuzanne: (looking sad) None of the other teachers are talking to me.\nSuzanne\u2019s thought is a fact. It does not indicate what the situation means to Suzanne.\n[Page 137]\n126 CBT Made Simple\nLook at the three possible responses below and pick the one that will help Suzanne identify what\nthe situation means to her.\n1. Help me understand what it is about the other teachers not talking to you that is a problem\nfor you.\n2. Have you tried talking to them?\n3. What do you feel when the other teachers don\u2019t talk to you?\nResponse #1 is the best answer to help Suzanne identify what the situation means to her and to help\nSuzanne identify her hot thoughts. Response #2 starts problem solving, and response #3 takes therapy\ninto a different direction.\nTherapist: H elp me understand what it is about the other teachers not talking to you that is\na problem for you.\nSuzanne: T he main problem is that I stand alone, while all the other teachers stand with a\nfriend and talk to each other.\nLook at the three possible responses below. Choose the response that will help Suzanne explore\nwhat the situation means to her.\n1. When the other teachers don\u2019t talk to you, how do you feel?\n2. What does it mean to you that you are standing alone, and the other teachers are standing\nwith a friend and talking to each other?\n3. When you say the other teachers don\u2019t talk to you, how many other teachers are outside at\nrecess?\nResponse #2 is the best response to explore what the situation means to Suzanne. Response #1 would\nbe a good response if you wanted to identify her feelings, and response #3 would be a good response if\nyou wanted to understand the situation.\nTherapist: W hat does it mean to you that you are standing alone, and the other teachers are\nstanding with a friend and talking to each other?\nSuzanne: I t means that the other teachers don\u2019t want to talk to me, because none of them\napproaches me.\nAt this point, Suzanne has identified a hot thought that explains her distress at recess. Her hot\nthought The other teachers don\u2019t want to talk to me is a thought about others. Her therapist could continue using the \u201cJust Ask\u201d questions and the questions about the meaning of the situation to explore\nwhether there were other hot thoughts.\n[Page 138]\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Thoughts 127\nWHEN THE SITUATION INVOLVES ANOTHER PERSON\nMany difficult situations involve other people besides your client. It can be helpful to ask what your\nclient thinks the other person\u2019s behavior means about how he or she thinks or feels about your client.\nFor example, in Suzanne\u2019s situation, her therapist asked, \u201cWhat do you think the other teachers not\ntalking to you means about how they feel toward you?\u201d Suzanne responded that she thought it meant\nthat they did not want to get to know her and liked to stay in their own little cliques.\nA good follow-up question is whether there is anything about your client that causes the other\nperson to behave in this manner. For example, Suzanne\u2019s therapist asked if there was anything about\nher that would cause the other teachers not to include her. Suzanne responded that she was shy and\nawkward and would not fit in.\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 7.1: (a) Yonas Asks a Question, and (b) Diana Wants to\nGo to College\nPractice identifying what situations mean to your clients.\nFOCUS ON FEELINGS\nAnother approach to exploring your client\u2019s thoughts is to ask what thoughts go with specific feelings. I often use this approach when my client is very aware of his feelings but is having trouble identifying his thoughts.\nThere are a number of ways I ask what thoughts go with my client\u2019s feelings. I have used these questions to explore a great variety of feelings, including sad, hurt, annoyed, disappointed, angry, and\nanxious. I often ask my client to take a moment, go back to the situation in his mind, and focus on the\nfeeling. I then ask one of the following questions:\n\u2022 What thoughts go with this feeling?\n\u2022 Help me understand, when you have this feeling, what thoughts go through your mind?\n\u2022 Just before you started to have this feeling, what went through your mind, or what were your\nthoughts?\nLet\u2019s look at an example of how you could use these questions. Jasmine just found out that her\ngrandfather, who lives out of town, was not feeling well. She has been feeling overwhelming guilt that\nshe had not visited him in a few months.\nTherapist: When you found out that your grandfather was not feeling well, what were your thoughts?\nJasmine: I just felt so guilty.\nTherapist: Any other thoughts?\n[Page 139]\n128 CBT Made Simple\nThe therapist starts by using one of the \u201cJust Ask\u201d questions. When Jasmine was unable to identify a hot\nthought but kept repeating her feelings, the therapist decided to try and identify the thoughts that went\nwith Jasmine\u2019s feelings.\nJasmine: No, just this really strong, overwhelming feeling of guilt.\nTherapist: Can you go back in your mind to when your mother told you that your grandfather was\nnot well?\nJasmine: Sure, I can remember it really clearly.\nTherapist: Can you focus on your feeling of guilt? Really let yourself feel the guilty feeling. (pausing)\nI am wondering what thoughts go with this guilty feeling.\nJasmine: I just think that a good granddaughter would visit more regularly; now he is sick and old.\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 7.1: Identify Thoughts\nLIST WORRIES\nOften when clients are in emotional distress, they worry. Worry is a big component of anxiety, but\nclients who feel depressed, guilty, ashamed, and angry also often worry. Worry is about expecting bad\nthings to happen. When my client is anxious or worried, I start by making a list of all the \u201cbad things\u201d\nhe is worried will happen. The more concrete the list, the more useful it is. Remember, I am looking for\nwhat my client is expecting to happen, not what he is expecting to feel. For example, \u201cI am worried I\nwill be anxious when giving a presentation,\u201d or \u201cI am worried that my presentation will not go well\u201d are\nless concrete worries than \u201cI am worried I will forget my talk.\u201d\nBelow are some good questions to explore what specifically your client is worried or anxious will\nhappen:\n\u2022 What are you anxious or worried is going to happen?\n\u2022 Is there anything you are specifically worried about happening?\n\u2022 What is the worst that could happen? Or what is your worst-case scenario?\n\u2022 What do you imagine happening?\nSuzanne\u2019s therapist realized that she did not fully understand what Suzanne was worried would\nhappen at the barbecue. The therapist said, \u201cI can tell that you are pretty anxious about the barbecue.\nI thought it would be helpful if we could make a list of what you are worried will happen, including your\nworst-case scenario.\u201d Together they made the following list:\nWhen I get there, everyone will be talking to each other, and no one will say hi to me.\nIf I approach one of the new teachers, she will turn her back on me.\n[Page 140]\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Thoughts 129\nI will stand there alone, with no one to talk to.\nIf I go up to one of the other teachers and say hi, I will have nothing to say.\nClear image of standing next to the barbecue, looking very awkward, holding a glass in my hand. I\nsee myself standing there all alone as everyone else is talking together.\nMaking a specific list of worries can be a very helpful tool to manage anxiety. Often, when clients\nsee their worries written out, they realize that some are unrealistic.\nI want you to try a quick exercise. Think of an upcoming event that you are somewhat anxious or\nworried about. Now, write down every bad thing you are worried might happen, and look at the list.\nTry to make your worry list as specific and concrete as possible. Do your worries seem more manageable? Maybe some of your worries are reasonable, in which case you can start to problem solve. Making\na list takes anxiety from a big ball of bad feelings to specific worries you can start to address. It is one\nmore way to hit the pause button on your automatic negative path.\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 7.2: Isabella Lists Her Worries\nPractice helping your clients list their worries.\nAgenda Item #3: Your Clients\u2019 Images\nSome of the most exciting work in CBT involves working with clients\u2019 images (Hackmann, BennettLevy, & Holmes, 2011). Imagery can be a very useful tool to help clients identify their hot thoughts.\nUSE IMAGERY TO RECREATE THE SITUATION\nSometimes when you ask your client, \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d he will respond with, \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow.\u201d I usually follow up with one of the \u201cJust Ask\u201d questions. I might say, \u201cWas anything going\nthrough your mind?\u201d Often that is enough to prompt my client to start talking about his thoughts, but\nsometimes my client still says, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d or tells me a thought that is not a hot thought. In that\ncase, one way to help your client identify his thoughts is to ask him to take a moment and imagine\nhimself back in the situation. When a client imagines being back in the situation, some of the feelings\nhe had at the time come back and he has better access to his thoughts.\nWhen you recreate a situation using imagery, you can use all of the five senses; however, asking\nclients to imagine seeing the situation and hearing anything that was said or any other sounds in the\nenvironment is often the most effective way to recreate the situation (Richardson, 1999).\nHere is an example of how recreating the situation in imagery helped Charles identify his thoughts.\nCharles is newly married and has a two-month-old baby. He has had trouble with alcohol in the past\nand is trying to drink moderately. He comes to therapy saying he \u201cblew it.\u201d He tells his therapist that a\nfew nights ago he went out with his buddies to a bar for a drink. When he got home he was very\ndepressed and had three glasses of scotch.\n[Page 141]\n130 CBT Made Simple\nCharles: I was so depressed when I got home, I just thought if I had a drink I would feel better.\nThere is no one right way to respond. Before she addressed the drinking, Charles\u2019s therapist wanted to\nunderstand what had happened at the bar that he became so depressed.\nTherapist: When you were out with your buddies, do you remember what you were feeling?\nCharles: Just normal, sort of down.\nTherapist: And your thoughts?\nCharles: Nothing, just hanging out with the guys.\nCBT theory tells us that if a client becomes distressed, there was a thought that fueled the distress.\nCharles\u2019s therapist wanted to discover what Charles was thinking that led to his feeling so depressed.\nTherapist: I am wondering if we could go back to the situation in the bar and try and figure out what\nwas going on with you, in particular your thoughts and feelings. Before you started feeling\ndown, can you remember any particular incident?\nCharles: My buddies were all talking about the baseball game, and I hadn\u2019t gone with them as I had\nto stay home with my kid that night. They were drinking and talking about all these plans\nthat I knew I couldn\u2019t do, \u2019cause I now spend weekends with my wife and son.\nTherapist: Can you go back to the night in your mind? Take a moment to see the bar, look around.\n(pauses) See your buddies\u2019 faces. Can you hear them talking about the game they went to?\nNow hear them talking about the other plans. Take a moment to really go back to the bar\nin your mind. See if you can remember what is going through your mind as your buddies\nwere talking.\nThe therapist uses both visual and auditory imagery.\nCharles: I guess I started thinking what a great time they were having, and that now all I do is\nchange diapers and work. Feels like my life is at a dead end. My wife never wants sex\nanymore; she just complains about how tired she is.\nOnce Charles can identify his thoughts, his depression and drinking make a lot more sense.\nEXPLORE IMAGES\nStrong negative feelings are often accompanied by intense affect-provoking images. For example,\nclients who are scared of spiders tend to have images of huge horrible spiders (Pratt, Cooper, &\nHackmann, 2004), and clients who are socially anxious tend to have negative images of themselves in\nsocial situations. A socially anxious client may have an image of himself stuttering, sweating, or behaving in an extremely awkward manner (Hirsch, Clark, Mathews, & Williams, 2003). Images can also be\nabout the past. It has long been known that clients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently have intrusive images in the form of flashbacks of the traumatic event. What researchers and\nclinicians are discovering is that clients with a variety of problems can have intrusive images that\n[Page 142]\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Thoughts 131\ncontribute to their distress. For example, often clients who are depressed have intrusive images of negative events that occurred in the past (Wheatley & Hackmann, 2011).\nSome clients can easily identify their images; however, many clients become aware of their images\nonly when specifically asked whether images accompany their emotional reaction (Brewin,\nChristodoulides, & Hutchinson, 1996). In my article \u201cIncorporating Imagery into Thought Records\u201d\n(Josefowitz, 2017), I describe different types of questions that can help clients identify their images. You\ncan find a Questions to Identify Your Client\u2019s Images handout at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\nStart with a general question. Do you have any images or memories connected with this situation?\nWhen you think of this situation, does it bring up any images or memories?\nExplore worries. Many clients who are anxious have very clear images of their feared event occurring.\nIf your client has a worst-case scenario, be sure to ask whether he actually sees the worst case happening in his mind.\nAsk about images that accompany your client\u2019s feelings. Do you have any images or memories that\naccompany your feelings? When you have this feeling, do you ever see pictures or images in your mind\nof yourself or other people?\nAsk about images that accompany your client\u2019s verbal thoughts. Clients often have thoughts about\nthemselves (I don\u2019t fit in); thoughts about others (my father is always critical of me); and thoughts about\nthe future (my boss will refuse to pay me overtime). You can ask, \u201cWhen you have this thought, do you\nsee or imagine this happening? Do you get a picture in your mind of yourself or the other person? What\ndo you see yourself or the other person doing or saying?\u201d\nSome clients\u2019 images are very detailed and elaborate. Many clients tell themselves long, complex\nstories; others have very brief, fleeting images. Try to notice your own images.\nSuzanne had a very clear image of herself standing in the principal\u2019s backyard, looking very\nawkward. She is holding a drink in her hand and is slightly sweaty. She is all alone and everyone else is\nhappily talking together. Her therapist asked if there were any sounds in her image or if she heard anything. Suzanne said she could hear the other teachers talking and laughing, and she was outside the\ngroup with nothing to say.\nImages hold encapsulated meanings. Once you have identified your client\u2019s images, you can ask\nwhat these images mean about himself, other people, or the future. Often images hold the same\nmeaning as\u2014and reinforce\u2014the hot thought (Josefowitz, 2017). In Suzanne\u2019s case, her images reinforced her hot thoughts that no one would want to talk to her and that she would not fit in.\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 7.3: Aabir Explores His Images\nPractice helping your clients identify their images.\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 7.2: Use Imagery to Explore Thoughts\n[Page 143]\n132 CBT Made Simple\nAgenda Item #4: Additional Strategies to Identify Thoughts\nClients\u2019 hopes, questions, and mood shifts can also provide glimpses into their thoughts.\nWHEN THOUGHTS ARE HOPES OR QUESTIONS\nThoughts that are hopes or questions pose unique challenges because they do not clearly explain\nthe meaning of the situation. This means that you need to continue to explore these thoughts in order\nto identify a hot thought. Let me give you some examples.\nKarl is very depressed. When his therapist asks about his thoughts, he sighs sadly and says he really\nhopes one day he will have children. This hope is not a thought that captures what his depression is\nabout. If Karl were truly hopeful, he would not be feeling depressed. When clients are depressed or\nanxious, they sometimes express as hopes the very things they feel hopeless or worried about. Karl\u2019s\ntherapist follows up and asked, \u201cI hear you hope that you will have children; are you worried that will\nnot happen?\u201d Karl became teary and responded, \u201cYes I think that for me having children is pretty hopeless, and it is the most important thing to me.\u201d Karl\u2019s thought, It is hopeless that I will have children, starts\nto explain his sadness.\nKaren is also depressed. When her therapist asks about her thoughts, she becomes teary and says\nshe keeps thinking, Will my husband leave me? The problem is you can\u2019t look for evidence for a question\u2014you need a statement to look for evidence. You can turn the question into a statement by either\nrephrasing it or exploring how your client would answer the question. For example, Karen\u2019s therapist\nrephrased her question by asking Karen, \u201cAre you thinking, My husband will leave me?\u201d\nLet\u2019s see how Raoul\u2019s therapist helped him further explore a thought that was in the form of a question. About a week ago, Raoul\u2019s boss asked him to work on a new project with some of his junior colleagues. He had been procrastinating over contacting them. Raoul was able to identify his feelings and\ntold his therapist he was embarrassed (8) and anxious (8). His therapist then asked him what he was\nthinking.\nRaoul: I keep wondering, Why didn\u2019t I get the promotion?\nTherapist: When you think, Why didn\u2019t I get the promotion, how do you answer the question in your\nhead?\nRaoul: I guess I think I just wasn\u2019t competent enough.\nTherapist: So one answer you give yourself is, I just wasn\u2019t competent enough. Do you give yourself any\nother answers?\nRaoul: Well, I also think my colleagues and boss don\u2019t respect me, and don\u2019t respect my work.\nWhen Raoul\u2019s therapist starts to explore how he answers the question, he starts to identify thoughts about\nhimself, I wasn\u2019t competent enough, and thoughts about others, My colleagues and boss don\u2019t respect me\nand don\u2019t respect my work.\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 7.4: Carol Wants to Apply for a Job\nPractice exploring thoughts that are facts, hopes, or questions.\n[Page 144]\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Thoughts 133\nUSE SHIFTS IN YOUR CLIENT\u2019S MOOD\nWhen clients talk about a difficult situation, they often become emotional. A shift in your client\u2019s\nmood usually goes with an important thought about self, others, or the future. For example, if a client\nlooks sad, blushes, or becomes agitated, it is an opportunity to \u201ccatch\u201d important thoughts. I usually say,\n\u201cI noticed you looked sad [or I noticed you looked upset]; what were you thinking?\u201d\nLet\u2019s look at an example that Suzanne brought up in the sixth session. Suzanne came into the\nsession saying she wanted to talk about her relationship with her husband. She started in a very calm\nmanner, saying that last night, she said she was tired and wanted to go to bed early. Her husband\nbecame annoyed and angry and told her that she was always tired and never wanted to do anything fun\nanymore. Suzanne started to become teary as she described her husband\u2019s response. Her therapist\nwanted to identify what thoughts went with her change in mood.\nTherapist: You looked teary as you remembered what your husband said.\nSuzanne: Yes, it was pretty awful to hear him say that I never want to go out anymore.\nTherapist: I am wondering what was going through your mind just now, as you got teary.\nSuzanne: (looking very sad and more teary) I thought that if I don\u2019t start being more fun, that he will\nleave me, and I will be all alone.\nYOUR TURN!\nNotice Raoul\u2019s Change in Mood\nUp to now Raoul has mainly focused on work issues. In session 7 he comes in and tells his therapist that\nhis youngest niece may have a serious illness. He explains in a calm voice, \u201cWhen I think of the possibility of my niece being sick, I know the whole family will just have to find a way to cope, as hard as\nit will be.\u201d He then goes on:\nRaoul: We will know for sure whether my niece has the illness on Monday, when we get\nthe results of the lab tests. (His voice cracks, he takes a deep breath, and looks very\nupset.)\nHow could his therapist use the shift in Raoul\u2019s mood to help him identify his thoughts about the\nlab results?\nLook at the three possible responses below and pick the one that will help Raoul identify his\nthoughts:\n1. What a hard situation. I hope that you are taking care of yourself.\n2. You just looked so upset, I am wondering what was going through your mind when you thought\nof getting the lab results?\n[Page 145]\n134 CBT Made Simple\n3. I can see how upset you are, but I also hear how important it is to you to cope. How are you\ncoping?\nResponse #2 is the most likely to lead Raoul to identify the thoughts that accompany his change in\nmood. In response #1, the therapist tries to be supportive but does not ask about Raoul\u2019s thoughts and\nis giving advice that Raoul did not ask for. In response #3, the therapist tries to be empathic and then\nmoves to problem solving without having a good definition of the problem.\nAgenda Item #5: How Do You Know Which Questions\nto Use?\nIt can be hard to know which question to use, and there is no right answer. Here is a summary of\nthe questions I use, in the general order in which I use them. You may initially find it helpful to keep\nthis list by your side during therapy. (You can download a Questions to Identify Your Client\u2019s Thoughts\nhandout at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.) The more you use these questions, the more they\nwill start to feel natural.\n\u2022 What were you thinking? Any other thoughts?\n\u2022 When a client\u2019s mood shifts, ask about thoughts.\n\u2022 What does the situation mean to you? OR What does the situation mean about yourself,\nothers, or your future?\n\u2022 How is this situation a problem for you?\n\u2022 What are some of the thoughts that go with your feelings?\n\u2022 Let\u2019s make a list of your worries. Do you have a worst-case scenario?\n\u2022 Do you have any images?\n\u2022 If the thought is a question: How do you answer this question in your mind?\n\u2022 If the thought is a hope: What are you worried about?\nLet\u2019s use some of these questions to help Michael, a twenty-eight-year-old client of mine, to identify\nhis thoughts. Michael\u2019s main agenda was addressing his anxiety about his relationship with a new girlfriend. He didn\u2019t understand why he was so anxious. We began with identifying situations where he felt\nanxious. Michael told me that his girlfriend was rarely verbally affectionate toward him; she almost\nnever said she missed him or that she was happy to see him. He described a text message he just\nreceived where she said, \u201cSee you tonight for dinner.\u201d As he talked about her behavior, he became\nalmost teary. Below is how I explored his thoughts; however, there are many other possible helpful\nresponses. As you read through the dialogue, consider what you would have said.\n[Page 146]\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Thoughts 135\nTherapist: When you received the text, what were your thoughts at the time?\nMichael: I don\u2019t know, it just doesn\u2019t feel good to get a text like that (eyes well up with tears).\nI started with using one of the \u201cJust Ask\u201d questions. However, Michael responded with a thought that was\nnot a hot thought, so I wanted to try another approach.\nTherapist: I can see you\u2019re becoming almost teary. What thoughts are going through your mind?\nI noticed the shift in his mood and thought it probably signaled an important thought.\nMichael: I know she had a relationship with another man for two years before me. I keep wondering,\nDid she treat him the same way?\nMichael\u2019s first thought is a fact: She had a relationship for two years before me. His second thought is a\nquestion: Did she treat him the same way? I chose to explore how he answered the question, as there\nseemed to be more emotion attached to that thought.\nTherapist: And how do you answer the question, \u201cDid she treat her past boyfriend in the same way\u201d?\nMichael: I think she treated him differently, or the relationship wouldn\u2019t have lasted.\nI wanted to explore what it meant to Michael that he thought his girlfriend had treated her previous boyfriend differently.\nTherapist: If she did treat her previous boyfriend differently, what would it mean to you?\nMichael: That she doesn\u2019t care about me as much as her previous boyfriend, maybe that she doesn\u2019t\nreally care about me at all.\nAt this point, Michael started to talk with more emotion about his fears that his girlfriend was not committed to the relationship and that he was not very important to her.\nAgenda Item #6: Link Thoughts to Feelings, Physical\nReactions, and Behavior\nAt this point in therapy, you have identified a specific situation that is problematic for your client,\nand you\u2019ve explored your client\u2019s reaction using the four-factor model. Identifying the relationships\namong the four factors provides your client with a structure for understanding what is maintaining his\nproblems, and provides you with a way of organizing your client\u2019s treatment. Here\u2019s where the written\nworksheet Understand Your Reaction comes in handy: you and your client have a document you can\nlook at when developing a model to understand the factors that are maintaining his problem.\nI start with asking my client to look over the Understand Your Reaction worksheet and ask if he\nsees a connection among the four factors. Often a client will spontaneously comment that his reaction\nmakes more sense, or that given his thoughts, it makes sense how he is feeling or behaving. If a client\ndoes not see the link between his thoughts and his feelings, physical reactions, and behaviors, I point it\nout to him. For example, I might say, \u201cWhen I look at your thoughts, it makes sense to me that you\n[Page 147]\n136 CBT Made Simple\nwould be [a feeling, for example depressed], or do [a behavior, for example procrastinate]. Does this\nmake sense to you?\u201d If my client agrees with me, I ask him to explain the link among the four factors\nin his own words.\nLet\u2019s look at the Understand Your Reaction worksheet that Suzanne completed to see how we can\nhelp her understand her difficulties.\nUnderstand Your Reaction\nSituation Feelings Physical Behaviors Thoughts\nReactions\n(Rate 1\u201310)\n(Rate 1\u201310)\nWhat? Who? What did I feel? How did my What did I do? What did I think?\nWhere?

(Suzanne and her therapist look at the worksheet.) When\nyou look at it, do you notice any connection among the four factors?\nSuzanne: Sort of\u2026I wasn\u2019t aware that I had all of those thoughts.\nSuzanne\u2019s therapist wants to positively reinforce Suzanne for identifying her thoughts. Rather than telling\nher, she wants Suzanne to make the link between her thoughts and how she was feeling and behaving.\nTherapist: You did a really good job of identifying your thoughts. Do you see a connection between\nyour thoughts and your feelings, physical reactions, and behaviors?\nSuzanne: I do. It makes sense to me that if all these thoughts were going through my head, I would\nfeel anxious.\nTherapist: I think you are right, and you said it very well. The thoughts really explain your feelings.\n[Page 148]\nIdentify Your Clients\u2019 Thoughts 137\nNotice how Suzanne\u2019s therapist reinforces Suzanne\u2019s understanding of the relationship between her thoughts\nand her feelings; she tells Suzanne that she articulated the relationship well, and repeats the connection.\nAt this point Suzanne\u2019s therapist would introduce the idea of examining her thoughts, to see if\nthere is any evidence for her beliefs. In the next chapter, we are going to cover how to look for evidence\nfor your clients\u2019 thoughts.\nDO I ALWAYS EXPLORE ALL FOUR FACTORS?\nFor most clients I use the Understand Your Reaction worksheet. However, you can start with just\nfocusing on one aspect of a client\u2019s problem. For example, remember my client Elsbeth, in chapter 5,\nwho was angry at her son for not doing his homework and chores? We started with just monitoring situations where she was angry. With other clients, if behavior is not part of the presenting problem, I start\nwith exploring feelings, physical reactions, and thoughts. Once my client understands the feeling\u2013\nthought connection, we add exploring his behaviors.\nEVALUATING YOUR CLIENT\u2019S WORKSHEET\nBelow are five criteria I use to evaluate whether I need to spend more time exploring any aspect of\na client\u2019s Understand Your Reaction worksheet. If a client did not find completing the worksheet\nhelpful, I check that it was done well; if it was not done well, I keep working with my client. You can\ndownload Understand Your Reaction Checklist at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\n1. Is the situation a factual description of what occurred or does it include feelings, physical reactions, behaviors, or thoughts?\n2.

Did you have a chance to\nnotice your own thoughts? Did you ask your clients about their thoughts and feelings? What did you\ndiscover?\nIf you did not do the homework, think about an upsetting experience that happened last week. Try\nto identify your feelings and thoughts. What did the situation mean to you? What was your worst-case\nscenario? Did you have any images?\nSet the Agenda\nIn this chapter we are going to build on the Understand Your Reaction worksheet and learn how to\nwork with thought records. You will ask your clients to examine the evidence for their negative thoughts\nand develop a balanced thought that takes into consideration all of the evidence. The whole process is\ncalled cognitive restructuring.\nAgenda Item #1: What are thought records?\nAgenda Item #2: Explain looking for evidence.\nAgenda Item #3: Find evidence that supports negative thoughts.\nAgenda Item #4: Find evidence against negative thoughts.\nAgenda Item #5: Develop balanced thoughts.\nWork the Agenda\nIn chapter 5 we talked about how your client has a well-worn automatic negative path that she zooms\ndown, ending up in a big black jumbled ball of feelings, physical reactions, behaviors, and thoughts.\n[Page 156]\nLook for Evidence and Create Balanced Thoughts 145\nOne way to hit the pause button on your client\u2019s automatic negative reaction is to use the four-factor\nmodel to help your client understand her reaction. Once your client has identified her feelings, physical\nreactions, behaviors, and thoughts, she is ready to actively change her negative path. One way to help\nyour client change her negative path is to ask her to step back and examine the evidence for her\nthoughts. Negative thoughts are like thinking habits; we assume they are true and don\u2019t stop to question whether they make sense. However, habits can be changed. Looking for evidence starts a process\nof developing new and more positive thought habits that are based on reality.\nAgenda Item #1: What Are Thought Records?\nA thought record is essentially a structure for helping your client look for the evidence for her hot\nthoughts. In its simplest form, a thought record is a worksheet where a client identifies a problematic\nsituation and then records her feelings and thoughts about the situation. The client then choses one\nthought to focus on. For a thought record to be effective, the thought the client chooses needs to be a\nhot thought. Once your client has identified the hot thought she wants to explore, she then looks for\nthe evidence for and against her thought. After the client has examined the evidence, she develops a\nnew more balanced or alternative thought. Many thought records also include space to record physical\nreactions and behavior. The Understand Your Reaction worksheet can be used as the first five columns\nof a thought record. Thought records also frequently involve having clients rate how much they believe\ntheir new balanced thought and rerate their feelings after completing the thought record; however, this\nis not essential. Below are the steps to complete a thought record. The steps in italics are common but\nnot essential to the process.\n1. Identify a problematic situation.\n2. Identify and rate feelings.\n3. Identify physical reactions.\n4. Identify behaviors.\n5. Identify thoughts.\n6. Choose a hot thought (a thought that is related to a negative feeling and a negative evaluation\nof self, other, or the future).\n7. Look for evidence for and against the hot thought.\n8. Create a balanced or alternative thought based on all of the evidence.\n9. Rate the extent to which you believe the new balanced thought.\n10. Rate your feelings now that you have examined the evidence.\nI use the Examine the Reality of Your Thoughts worksheet, which follows, to help clients complete\nthe rest of the thought record process.\n[Page 157]\n146 CBT Made Simple\nExamine the Reality of Your Thoughts\nThought I want to examine:\nEvidence for My Thought Evidence Against My Thought\nConclusion or thoughts that consider all the evidence:\nThe theory behind thought records is that clients assume their negative thoughts are true. Asking\nclients to examine the evidence for their thoughts stops their automatic reaction and starts a process of\nself-reflection. When clients examine the evidence for their thoughts and create their own balanced\nthought, they develop new ways of thinking and less extreme attitudes toward the world and themselves. New ways of thinking open up the possibility of behavioral change. Evidence clearly shows that\n[Page 158]\nLook for Evidence and Create Balanced Thoughts 147\nthis process of cognitive restructuring is related to alleviating depression and anxiety (Beck & Dozois,\n2011).\nA written thought record is not essential. Looking for the evidence for a thought can be done as\npart of a therapy conversation. However, I would encourage you to use the Understand Your Reaction\nand Examine the Reality of Your Thoughts worksheets as written tools. A written thought record provides a structure and makes the process of identifying thoughts and looking for evidence very concrete.\nSome therapists like to use a seven-column thought record with space for identifying the four factors,\nlooking for evidence, and developing a balanced thought. Dennis Greenberger and Christine Padesky\nuse this type of thought record in their book Mind Over Mood (2016). Personally, however, I like to\nbreak the thought record down into two stages, first using the Understand Your Reaction worksheet\nand then the Examine the Reality of Your Thoughts worksheet. You can download both at http://www\n.newharbinger.com/38501.\nAlthough looking for evidence is a powerful intervention, looking for evidence once will not shift\na longstanding negative thought. Your clients will need to complete many thought records, over a\nperiod of time, to change their negative thoughts. However, while a client\u2019s thoughts vary somewhat\nfrom situation to situation, most clients have recurring negative thinking patterns. If you identify a client\u2019s thoughts in one situation, most likely these thoughts will recur in other situations. This means\nthat the thought record you complete for one situation will often be relevant to other situations.\nCHOOSE A HOT THOUGHT\nIf your client has one central negative hot thought that is closely related to her emotional distress,\nthat is the thought you will focus on. However, your client may have more than one hot thought, for\nexample, I am an inadequate mother and My partner does not love me. In this case, your client needs to\nchoose which thought to work with, as you can only examine the evidence for one thought at a time. If\na client has more than one hot thought, I ask, \u201cWhich thought do you think is the most central, or the\nmost important for us to examine?\u201d Another question I have found helpful is, \u201cWhich thought do you\nthink is most closely related to your strongest negative emotion?\u201d Clients usually know which thought\nthey need to focus on. Most of our negative thoughts are repetitive. If your client chooses to examine I\nam an inadequate mother, she will have another chance to examine My partner does not love me.\nWHAT IS SOCRATIC QUESTIONING?\nAll CBT books talk about the importance of Socratic questioning. The term comes from the Greek\nphilosopher, Socrates. Socratic questioning is the idea that skillful questioning can help your clients\nexamine the assumptions behind their thoughts, consider aspects of the situation they had ignored, or\nunderstand their situation from a different perspective. Your role is to ask questions that help your\nclient understand her problems in a new light.\nThe basic idea is that it is more effective to ask questions that help clients reach their own conclusions than to tell a client what to think. If I could post one sticky note on all my readers\u2019 heads, it\nwould say:\nConclusions you reach yourself are more convincing than conclusions someone tells you.\n[Page 159]\n148 CBT Made Simple\nAgenda Item #2: Explain Looking for Evidence\nOnce your client has identified a hot thought, you need to explain the idea of looking for evidence.\nEssentially, you are going to teach your client to examine her thoughts for their validity rather than\ntreating thoughts as facts. Your client needs to learn to take a step back and put some distance between\nherself and her thoughts.\nMy clients almost always immediately grasp the idea of looking for evidence, though sometimes\nthey assure me that they know their negative thoughts are accurate. Here is how I usually explain\nlooking for evidence (you can find a copy at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501):\nYou did a really good job of identifying your thoughts and catching the negative thoughts that\ncause you to feel bad. I am wondering if you would be willing to examine your thoughts. I\nwould like to look at the evidence that supports your negative thoughts, and also at evidence\nthat doesn\u2019t support your negative thoughts. Negative thoughts are like thought habits. By that\nI mean they are ways of thinking that you are used to, but you have not examined whether they\nare accurate. When we look for evidence, I want us to focus on facts. That way, we can evaluate the accuracy of your thoughts. Would that be okay with you?\nWe need to pick one thought that we want to examine. I want to look over the thoughts\nyou identified that go with your negative feelings and see if we can pick one that feels the most\ncentral to you, or is the most related to your strongest negative emotional reaction.\nYOUR TURN!\n\uf0b2\nPractice in Your Imagination: Explain Looking for Evidence\nI want to ask you to imagine explaining looking for the evidence for a hot thought. Before you start,\nrate from 1 to 10 how comfortable you feel explaining looking for evidence for and against a hot\nthought. At the end of the exercise, rate your level of comfort again to see if it changed. Now, let\u2019s try\nthis exercise.\nChoose a client who you think would benefit from looking for evidence for his or her thoughts. Try\nto get a picture of him or her in your mind. Imagine yourself in your office with your client. See your\noffice; notice the sounds and smells in the room. Imagine that your client has identified a negative\nthought and you want to explain how to examine the evidence for his thought. Read over how I suggest\nexplaining the process of looking for evidence while imagining yourself saying the words. You can also\nuse your own phrases. Really hear and feel yourself explaining how to examine the evidence. Now,\nimagine explaining looking for evidence two more times with the same client. Each time, imagine that\nyour client responds positively.\n[Page 160]\nLook for Evidence and Create Balanced Thoughts 149\nAgenda Item #3: Find Evidence That Supports\nNegative Thoughts\nIf you are going to help your client reevaluate her negative thoughts, you need to understand the\nevidence she uses to support them. Many clients find that writing down the evidence, or saying the\nevidence out loud, makes it more manageable. It becomes a fact that you can talk about, rather than\nsomething that sits in your head. Sometimes when a client starts to look for facts that support her negative thoughts, she realizes that there aren\u2019t any, or not as many as she thought. Sometimes a client\ndiscovers that her negative thoughts are fairly accurate. This can also be helpful, as it highlights the\nneed to problem solve and cope with a real problem.\nSUZANNE EXAMINES THE EVIDENCE\nLet\u2019s look at how we could help Suzanne with her anxiety about the invitation to the principal\u2019s\nbarbecue. She identified her hot thought as No one will want to talk to me. Suzanne\u2019s therapist explained\nthe process of looking at the evidence, and Suzanne was willing to try.\nTherapist: I want to start with looking for the evidence that supports your thought, No one will want\nto talk to me. What makes you think that it might be true?\nSuzanne: Well, I know that I will feel anxious when I go to the barbecue.\nSuzanne\u2019s thought, I will feel anxious when I go to the barbecue, is not a fact. It is a prediction\nabout how she will feel. Suzanne\u2019s therapist wants to explore whether there are any facts that support her\nhot thought.\nTherapist: I hear you will feel anxious, but I wonder if there are any facts that support your belief that\nno one will want to talk to you.\nSuzanne: What do you mean?\nTherapist: If I wanted to prove that no one would want to talk to you, I would have to back up my\nopinion with facts. For example, if you were in a court of law, the judge would look only at\nthe facts. Does that make sense to you?\nThe therapist wants to be sure that Suzanne understands the idea of facts. Sometimes using the analogy\nof a court of law can be helpful.\nSuzanne: What about the fact that I hardly know any of the other teachers, does that count?\nTherapist: Of course, that is a fact. I wonder\u2026how is it related to no one wanting to talk to you?\nSuzanne: Well, none of them have made an effort to talk to me. I usually stand alone at recess and\nI eat lunch by myself also.\n[Page 161]\n150 CBT Made Simple\nTherapist: Okay, so let\u2019s write down what you just said, to be sure we don\u2019t forget. How would you put\nthat in your own words? (Either Suzanne or her therapist writes.) Other evidence that makes\nyou think, No one will want to talk to me?\nNotice that Suzanne\u2019s therapist is gathering data; she is not refuting or problem solving.\nSuzanne: I think it\u2019s mainly at lunch and recess. Maybe also when I arrive in the morning, no one\nsays hi to me, or smiles.\nUSE THE PAST TO UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT\nIt can be helpful to ask your client if she had any experiences in her childhood or past that support,\nor that are related to, her negative thoughts. Making the link between her history and her current\nthinking can help your client start to see that what was true in her past is not necessarily true in her\ncurrent life.\nTake a moment to think about how you could ask Suzanne about the relationship between any past\nevents and her hot thought.\nTherapist: Suzanne, is there anything in your past that would cause you to think, No one will want to\nbe my friend?\nSuzanne: Actually, when I was in high school, in my last year, there was a group of really awful girls\nwho made my life miserable. They wanted to use my house for a drinking party when my\nparents were away for the weekend, and I said no. They spread awful rumors about me, and\nI lost almost all my friends. It was a horrible, lonely time in my life. I felt then that no one\nwanted to be my friend.\nWhen a client discloses painful memories from her past, you need to decide if you want to focus on the\nmemory or continue with the thought record. Generally, if it is the first time a client discloses a traumatic\nmemory, I ask my client if she would like to focus on the memory. Suzanne disclosed a painful memory\nfrom high school that was upsetting, but not traumatic. Her therapist thought it was more important to\ncontinue with the thought record than to explore the high school memory.\nTherapist: It must have been very upsetting to have this happen. Is that when the thought No one\nwants to be my friend started?\nSuzanne: It was pretty awful. Yeah, that\u2019s when I became more self-conscious and started worrying\nabout people liking me. Before that, I just had a bunch of friends whom I hung out with.\nTherapist: It sounds like it really changed your outlook. In another session, it might be important for\nus to talk about what happened in high school. For now, could we just put it down in the\n\u201cEvidence for\u201d column?\n[Page 162]\nLook for Evidence and Create Balanced Thoughts 151\nLet\u2019s see how Suzanne filled in the \u201cEvidence for My Thought\u201d column of her Examine the Reality\nof Your Thoughts worksheet.\nThought I want to examine: No one will want to be my friend.\nEvidence for My Thought Evidence Against My Thought\n\u2022 No one has made an effort to talk to me.\n\u2022 I am alone at recess and lunch.\n\u2022 Other teachers do not say hi when I get to\nschool in the morning.\n\u2022 In high school, some girls started rumors and\nI lost almost all my friends.\nAgenda Item #4: Find Evidence Against Negative Thoughts\nClients tend to focus on information that confirms their negative thoughts. Your job is to help your\nclient focus on information she usually ignores and that challenges her negative thoughts. You can\nthink of your client as living in a room filled with information, but only the information that supports\nher negative thoughts is lit; the rest of the room is in the dark. Your job is to use questions so that the\nwhole room is in the light. Once the whole room is lit and your client sees all of the evidence, she can\ndecide if her previous belief still makes sense.\nFigure 8.1 shows how a therapist used a drawing of lighting up a room to help her client Paula, who\nis a doctor, understand that she was only looking at information that confirmed her hot thought. In one\nof Paula\u2019s therapy sessions she was very distressed and told her therapist she thought that she was not a\ngood doctor. Her evidence for her belief was that this past week she had misdiagnosed a patient and\nanother patient had been very angry because she had kept him waiting half an hour. Paula and her\ntherapist looked at the evidence against her belief. Paula noted that she had been a successful doctor\nfor twenty years, almost all her patients are happy, and she rarely keeps patients waiting; she also gave\nexamples of many complicated diagnoses she made over the years.\nHer therapist drew figure 8.2 to help Paula understand that she only sees information that confirms\nher belief that she is a bad doctor, and that all of the information that suggests she is a good doctor is\nignored or kept in the dark. Her therapist told Paula they had to shine a light on all of the\ninformation.\n[Page 163]\n152 CBT Made Simple\nSuccessful doctor\nPatients\nfor 20 years\nrarely wait\nMany\ncomplicated\nMost of my\ndiagnoses\npatients are\nhappy\nOne patient Misdiagnosed\nwaited one patient\nFigure 8.1. Paula\u2019s therapist shines some light on ignored information.\nThere are three types of questions you can use to examine the evidence against a hot thought:\n1. Is there evidence that contradicts my negative thoughts?\n2. How probable is my negative prediction?\n3. Is there another perspective?\nEVIDENCE THAT CONTRADICTS YOUR CLIENT\u2019S\nNEGATIVE THOUGHTS\nI generally start by directly asking my client if she has any experiences that suggest that her hot\nthought is not true, or not true all of the time. When Suzanne\u2019s therapist asked, \u201cHave you had any\nexperiences that suggest that people may want to be your friend?\u201d Suzanne responded quietly, \u201cI had\nsome friends in my previous school.\u201d\nEvidence needs to be concrete and detailed. Examining the evidence for and against a negative automatic thought is similar to weighing evidence on a scale. On one side is the evidence for the negative\nthought and on the other side is the evidence against the negative thought. The evidence for the negative thought is usually very heavy and full of details. The evidence against the negative thought is often\nmore abstract and lacking in details. It can feel light compared to the heavy evidence for the thought.\nThe more your client can provide detailed examples of evidence against the negative thought, the more\nshe will be emotionally engaged, and the more the evidence against the negative thought will weigh\ncompared with the evidence for it.\n[Page 164]\nLook for Evidence and Create Balanced Thoughts 153\nSuzanne\u2019s evidence against her hot thought is that she had \u201csome friends.\u201d This is not very strong\nor emotionally compelling evidence. To make the evidence more compelling, her therapist started by\nasking for specific examples, and then asked for details about the examples. Below are some of the questions her therapist asked.\n\u2022 Can you give me examples of some of your friends?\n\u2022 When you say you had \u201csome friends,\u201d can you tell me about them?\n\u2022 What kinds of things did you do with your friends, both at school and outside of school?\n\u2022 How did you know that they wanted to be your friend?\nHer therapist discovers that Suzanne was friendly with many of the teachers at her previous school,\nbut she had two good friends, Rita and Faiza. They generally ate lunch together and worked on the\nschool play together. They often saw each other on weekends, and sometimes they would get together\nwith their children and spouses. Suzanne thought they were funny, nice, warm people whom she had a\ngood time with. Since she moved to her new school, she has seen less of them. They have often called\nto see if she wanted to do something on the weekend, but she\u2019s been too tired. Faiza dropped by the\nother day with a cake she had made to cheer Suzanne up.\nWhat was the effect of making the evidence more concrete and detailed? Did it become more\nemotionally compelling? When her therapist explores the details of her friendship with Rita and Faiza,\nSuzanne\u2019s mood lifts. When her mood lifts, she is also more likely to remember other situations that\nchallenge her negative automatic thoughts. Figure 8.3 captures the idea of making the evidence heavier:\nwhen Suzanne\u2019s evidence against her hot thought No one will want to be my friend becomes more\ndetailed and concrete, it becomes more compelling.\n[Page 165]\n154 CBT Made Simple\nI have some friends.\nNo one has made an effort to talk to me.\nI am alone at recess and lunch.

The following\nquestions are inspired by a number of wonderful CBT therapists, including Judy Beck (2011), Dennis\nGreenberger and Christine Padesky (2016), and Jackie Persons and colleagues (2001). You can download a Questions to Identify Evidence Against Negative Thoughts handout at http://www.newharbin\nger.com/38501.\n\u2022 What would you say to someone who thought this way?\n\u2022 What do you think a friend or someone who cared for you would say if he or she knew you had\nthis thought?\n\u2022 If you were in a better mood, what would you think?\n\u2022 Five years from now, looking back, what might you think?\n\u2022 Is there any information that contradicts your interpretation? Even small pieces of\ninformation?\n\u2022 Is there any positive information that you are ignoring?\nLet\u2019s see how Suzanne\u2019s therapist uses some of these questions.\nTherapist: It sounds as if Faiza and Rita are really good friends. What do you think they would say if\nthey knew you were thinking, No one will want to be my friend?\nSuzanne: They would say it was ridiculous. That of course people would want to be my friend.\nHer therapist wants to expand this evidence.\nTherapist: And if they really wanted to convince you, what might be some evidence they would\ntell you?\nSuzanne: Well, they would probably remind me of all the friends I had at my previous school; they\nwould also remind me that they like me.\nTherapist: So they would remind you of your friends from your previous school and that they like\nyou. And how is the fact that Rita and Faiza like you evidence against No one will want\nto be my friend?\nThe therapist starts with a summary statement and then relates the evidence to the hot thought.\nSuzanne: (tentatively) Well I guess, if they like me, other people might like me?\nTherapist: (smiling) Do you think that might be true?\nSuzanne: (smiling) Yeah, I guess so.\n[Page 167]\n156 CBT Made Simple\nGiven that Suzanne\u2019s mood has lifted a bit, she is more likely to remember other positive information.\nTherapist: I am wondering if there is any positive information that you are ignoring.\nSuzanne: (smiling) When I think of it, there is actually quite a bit. In college I had lots of good\nfriends whom I still see, at least I saw them until I got depressed. I also have a bunch of\nfriends from my neighborhood that I see on weekends, at the park.\nHow could you expand the evidence that Suzanne just discussed? Remember, ask for an example and then\nask for details.\nSuzanne\u2019s evidence is starting to look very different!\nThought I want to examine: No one will want to be my friend.\nEvidence for My Thought Evidence Against My Thought\n\u2022 No one has made an effort to talk to me. \u2022 I had some friends in my previous school.\n\u2022 I am alone at recess and lunch. \u2022 Rita and Faiza are good friends; ate lunch\ntogether; worked on the school play; hung\n\u2022 Other teachers do not say hi when I get to\nout on weekends; went out as couples; still\nschool in the morning.\ncall to see if I want to do something; Faiza\n\u2022 In high school, some girls started rumors brought a cake.\nand I lost almost all my friends.\n\u2022 Friends from college whom I still see\n\u2022 Friends from neighborhood\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 8.1: Looking for Evidence\nHOW PROBABLE ARE MY PREDICTIONS?\nClients\u2019 thoughts are often about the future and include negative predictions. Some examples\nmight be No one will like me, I will fail the test, I will not get the job, or No one will like my Facebook post.\nWhen thoughts are about the future, you want to look for evidence about how likely it is that the negative event will occur. Below are the steps I usually use.\n1. Identify what your client fears will happen, and make the list as concrete as possible.\n2. Rate the probability that each feared event will occur.\n3. Examine the evidence for the probability that each feared event will occur.\n4. Rerate the probability that each feared event will occur.\n[Page 168]\nLook for Evidence and Create Balanced Thoughts 157\nI often use the following worksheet, How Probable Are My Predictions?, which you can download\na full-scale version of at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\nHow Probable Are My Predictions?\nWhat I Fear Probability Evidence That Evidence Against Rerate the\nWill Happen That Feared Supports the the Probability Probability\nEvent Will Probability That\nOccur Feared\nEvent Will\n(0\u2013100%)\nOccur\nHere is Suzanne\u2019s list of what she feared would happen at the barbecue:\n\u2022 When I get there, everyone will be talking to each other, and no one will say hi to me.\n\u2022 If I approach one of the new teachers, she will turn her back on me.\n\u2022 I will stand there alone, with no one to talk to.\n\u2022 If I go up to one of the other teachers, I will have nothing to say.\n\u2022 Clear image of standing next to the barbecue grill, looking very awkward, holding a glass in my\nhand, and being all alone as everyone else talks together.\nRate the probability of each event occurring. Suzanne\u2019s therapist asked her to rate from 0 to 100\npercent how likely it was that each of these events would occur. Suzanne thought that the first three\nevents, as well as her image, were very unlikely and rated them at 20 percent. Her therapist asked\nSuzanne to explain what made them unlikely. Suzanne laughed and said that it was a small group, and\nthe principal would make sure everyone was talking to someone. She rated \u201chaving nothing to say\u201d as\nprobable, at 80 percent.\nExamine the evidence. Suzanne and her therapist looked at the evidence for \u201cIf I go up to one of the\nother teachers, I will have nothing to say.\u201d Suzanne explained that when she was anxious, she sometimes had difficulty finding something to talk about. This had happened at her husband\u2019s holiday party.\n[Page 169]\n158 CBT Made Simple\nWhen Suzanne and her therapist examined the evidence against her prediction, she was able to think\nof many examples when she had been able to find something to say at social events, even if it had been\ndifficult. Even at her husband\u2019s holiday party she had found something to talk about with her husband\u2019s\ncolleagues.\nRerate the probability. After looking at the evidence, Suzanne rated the probability of having nothing\nto say at about 50 percent. Before and after probability ratings allow your client to see that there has\nbeen a decrease, even if the probability is not a 0.\nYou can see how Suzanne and her therapist completed the How Probable Are My Predictions?\nworksheet at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\nReal and false alarms. Friedberg, Friedberg, and Friedberg (2001) have a wonderful exercise that helps\nclients look at whether their negative predictions actually occur. The therapist asks the client to list all\nof her worries for the coming week. The next week they check which worries actually happened. Most\nof the time, the majority of worries are \u201cfalse alarms.\u201d\nTolerance of uncertainty. Unless your client\u2019s negative predictions are totally bizarre, no one can\nguarantee that they will not occur. Clients need to learn to tolerate uncertainty (Dugas & Robichaud,\n2007). This can be hard, but a first step is talking honestly with your clients about accepting that life is\nuncertain, and that while not impossible, the probability of the feared events occurring is small.\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 8.2: How Probable Are My Predictions?\nIS THERE ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE?\nSometimes a client\u2019s negative thought is based on an overly negative interpretation of an event; you\nwant to help your client find a more benign interpretation. Let\u2019s look at an example. Raoul was upset\nbecause a colleague walked past him in the hall without saying hello. Raoul thought this meant that\nhis colleague was avoiding him. Another possible interpretation is that his colleague was in a hurry or\npreoccupied.\nSometimes simply asking your client whether she can think of a different perspective is enough to\nstart her thinking in a different way. However, sometimes you need to be more active. The following\ntwo approaches can help clients reach a more benign interpretation: (1) taking a close look at the facts\nof the situation and (2) exploring whether your client is blaming herself for something she has little or\nno control over.\nTake a close look at the facts. Clients tend to focus on narrow information that reinforces their\nthoughts; your job is to help your clients broaden their perspective and look at all of the facts of a situation to see whether there is a more balanced interpretation.\nDo you remember in the last chapter Raoul was extremely upset that he had been assigned to work\nwith junior colleagues on a report? He was sure this meant that his boss did not respect him. Below are\nquestions you can use to help your client examine her interpretation of a situation. You can download\na Questions to Gather More Information about the Situation handout at http://www.newharbinger\n.com/38501.\n[Page 170]\nLook for Evidence and Create Balanced Thoughts 159\n\u2022 How did this situation come about?\n\u2022 Who are the other people you will be working/interacting with?\n\u2022 Is there any information that contradicts your interpretation? Even small pieces of\ninformation?\n\u2022 Is there any positive information that you are ignoring?\n\u2022 Have you ever behaved in a similar way? What was your motivation?\nLet\u2019s see what happens when Raoul\u2019s therapist uses these questions to explore Raoul\u2019s interpretation of the situation.\nQuestions to Gather More Information\nabout the Situation\nQuestions Raoul\u2019s Response\nHow did this situation come about? My boss approached me and said he would like\nme to work on this report, as he thought I had\nthe needed expertise and had done this kind of\nwork before.\nWho are the other people you will be working/ Two junior colleagues, who have been hired in\ninteracting with? the past two years.\nIs there any information that contradicts your Often senior people are asked to work with more\ninterpretation?

It is pretty common in\nthe firm.\nIs there any positive information that you are One of the junior people told me she was really\nignoring? glad to have me on the team, that she had heard\ngreat things about me.\nHave you ever behaved in a similar way? What In the past, I assigned a senior person to work on\nwas your motivation? a project, to be sure that there was someone\nwith the needed expertise on the project.\nRaoul\u2019s therapist asked him whether this additional information had any implications for his\nthought that being assigned to the project meant that his boss did not respect him. Raoul replied that\nit might mean they wanted a senior person on this project. I am looking for a crack in my client\u2019s beliefs.\nJust like water seeping through a stone, if you can get a small crack, it can spread.\n[Page 171]\n160 CBT Made Simple\nYour Turn!\nHelp Suzanne Take a Close Look at the Facts\nSuzanne was very distressed that none of the teachers talked to her at recess. This was a key piece of\nevidence in her belief that no one would want to be her friend. Her therapist thought it would be worthwhile to see if there was a more benign interpretation.\nTherapist: O ne of the pieces of evidence you use to support your belief that none of the\nteachers would want to be your friend is that no one talks to you at recess.\nLook at the three possible responses below and pick the one that will help Suzanne start to gather\nfacts about the situation.\n1. It seems strange to me that they don\u2019t talk to you; they sound like horrible people.\n2. How could you join one of the groups of teachers?\n3. Can you describe to me what happens at recess, what the other teachers do, and what you do?\nResponse #3 is the best question to help collect information on what occurs at recess. Depending on\nthe answer, the therapist can follow up in different ways. Response #1 supports Suzanne\u2019s interpretation of the situation. Response #2 starts a problem-solving process before the problem is clarified.\nTherapist: Can you describe to me what happens at recess and what the other teachers do?\nSuzanne: W e each have an area we are responsible for. Actually, when I think of it, only\nthe two teachers who are assigned to the jungle gym stand together. The rest of\nus stand alone in the school yard. Some of the other teachers might approach\neach other and say a few words. I just stand in the back of the school yard next\nto the swings.\nLook at the three possible responses below and pick the one that will help Suzanne start to gain a\ndifferent perspective.\n1. I hear that everyone is assigned to an area and that most of the teachers are standing alone; do\nI have it right?\n2. How much of a discipline problem are the children? What kinds of things do you find help\nwith maintaining order?\n3. It seems to me that everyone is alone, and it doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t want to talk to you.\nResponse #1 is the best response. It is a summary of what Suzanne has told her therapist and is most\nlikely to encourage her to consider a different perspective on what standing alone at recess means. In\nresponse #2, the therapist is gathering data about the situation, but the data is not relevant to\nSuzanne\u2019s thought, No one wants to be my friend. In response #3, the therapist is telling Suzanne\nwhat to think.\n[Page 172]\nLook for Evidence and Create Balanced Thoughts 161\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 8.3: Take a Close Look at the Facts\nIs your client blaming herself for something she has little or no control over? Many clients feel\nresponsible for situations they have no control over or believe that the situation is a reflection of themselves, when it is at least partially due to external factors. Two of the questions I find most helpful are:\n1. Are there other factors that could contribute to this situation?\n2. Am I blaming myself for something I have little or no control over?\nLet\u2019s look at some examples of clients\u2019 thoughts and see if there are other ways of looking at the\nsituation. You can download a Other Ways of Understanding the Situation worksheet at http://www\n.newharbinger.com/38501.\nOther Ways of Understanding the Situation\nSituation Client\u2019s Thought Are there other factors What can I control?\nthat could contribute\nAm I blaming myself for\nto this situation?\nsomething I have little\nList all of the factors. or no control over?\nClient\u2019s 16-year- I am a bad mother.

Should you just tell your client? Let\u2019s go back to the basic\nprinciples of Socratic questioning. You want to ask questions that draw your client\u2019s attention to information she is not thinking about. Once your client has the information, you want her to draw her own\nconclusion.\nFor example, Raoul tells you that he has stopped contributing to meetings because he believes that\n\u201cno one is interested in my comments.\u201d You remember that a few weeks ago Raoul described making a\ncomment in a project meeting, to which one of his colleagues responded, \u201cThat is the best solution\nanyone has suggested so far.\u201d You could remind Raoul of his colleague\u2019s comment and then tell Raoul\nthat clearly people are interested in what he has to say. However, it is more effective if Raoul can reach\nhis own conclusions. It is better to ask Raoul if he remembers what his colleague said, and then once\nRaoul has told you, ask him what his colleague\u2019s statement might mean about his thought, No one is\ninterested in my comments.\nYOUR TURN!\nHelp Cynthia Reach Her Own Conclusions\nCynthia was in therapy because she was having trouble with low self-esteem that was affecting many\ndifferent areas of her life. She tells her therapist, \u201cI was so embarrassed. I was at a party and a guy I\nknow from work kept hitting on me. He kept telling me he wanted to go out with me and that I was\nbeautiful. I just kept ignoring him. Men are only interested in me for sex.\u201d\nCynthia\u2019s hot thought is Men are only interested in me for sex.\nCynthia\u2019s therapist tells her, \u201cYou are a wonderful woman; you deserve to find a great man. You\nhave told me that lots of your male colleagues like and respect you.\u201d\nInstead of telling Cynthia what to think, what questions could the therapist ask that would help\nCynthia reach her own conclusions?\nFrom previous sessions her therapist knows that Cynthia is dating John, who frequently tells her\nthat he cares about her. John always checks that she also wants sex before they have sexual relations.\nCynthia has also talked about male colleagues who made comments indicating they respect Cynthia,\nespecially Mike and Chris, whom she works closely with.\nYour job is to think of questions that you could ask to help Cynthia reach her own conclusion about\nwhether men are only interested in her for sex. You can find my suggestions in the appendix.\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 8.2: A Therapist Is Having a Bad Day\nPractice developing questions to help your clients reach their own conclusions.\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 8.3: Suzanne Is Asked to Be a Maid of Honor\nPractice using a therapy dialogue to help clients reach their own conclusions.\n[Page 174]\nLook for Evidence and Create Balanced Thoughts 163\nCONSOLIDATE THE EVIDENCE AGAINST THE HOT THOUGHT\nMost likely your client is used to thinking about the information that supports her negative thoughts\nand tends to minimize the information against her negative thoughts. If you want your client to emotionally connect to the information against her negative thought, it is important to review the information. Reviewing focuses your client\u2019s attention on this information and starts to create new thought\nhabits.\nUsually I simply say, \u201cLet\u2019s review the information we have gathered.\u201d If you have not written down\nthe evidence, this is a good time to do so. You can say, \u201cYou collected some very important evidence\nabout your thoughts. I think it would be helpful if we wrote it down, to be sure that we don\u2019t forget it.\u201d\nI encourage my clients to do the writing, as I think it helps with the review process. (If I am doing the\nwriting, I repeat out loud what I am writing.) This also provides the client with a piece of paper she can\ntake home and review as part of homework.\nYou can also use imagery to help evidence against a hot thought come alive (Josefowitz, 2016) by\nasking your client to form an image in her mind of the memories and situations that constitute the\nevidence against the hot thought. For Suzanne, an important piece of evidence against her hot thought\nwas eating lunch almost every day with Rita and Faiza at her previous school. Her therapist asked\nSuzanne to form an image in her mind of eating lunch with her friends. She asked Suzanne to remember the lunchroom, the fun of being together, and how much they liked each other. Her therapist then\nwent over the rest of the evidence, asking Suzanne to form an image for each example. When they had\nfinished, the evidence felt much more real and emotionally engaging.\nAgenda Item #5: Develop Balanced Thoughts\nThe final step in completing a thought record is evaluating the original hot thought and creating\na new more balanced thought that takes all of the evidence into account. This is when you fill in the\n\u201cConclusion\u201d section of the Examine the Reality of Your Thoughts worksheet. The basic question is,\n\u201cGiven all of the evidence, is your hot thought accurate, or does it need to be modified?\u201d Here are some\nquestions I regularly use. You can find Questions for a Balanced Thought at http://www.newharbinger\n.com/38501.\n\u2022 When you look at all of the evidence, what does this say about your original hot thought?\n\u2022 When you look at all of the evidence, what would be a more accurate thought?\n\u2022 What might be a thought that captures all of the evidence?\n\u2022 Let\u2019s take a moment and look at all of the evidence. What did you learn?\n\u2022 You initially interpreted the situation in a specific way. When you look at the evidence, is there\nanother interpretation that either makes more sense or might be equally true?\n\u2022 What would you tell someone who thought the way you did, and had all of this evidence?\nLet\u2019s look at how Suzanne initially completed the Understand Your Reaction worksheet and the\nExamine the Reality of Your Thoughts worksheet. Then, let\u2019s look at the evidence that Suzanne and\nher therapist collected.\n[Page 175]\n164 CBT Made Simple\nSituation Feeling Physical Behavior Thoughts\nReaction\nPrincipal Nervous (7) Clenched Did not I don\u2019t want to go; the other new\ninvited me to stomach (4) respond teachers will be there; I won\u2019t fit\nWorried (8)\nbarbecue with in; I will just stand there looking\nTense\nthe three other Embarrassed awkward; no one will want to\nshoulders (5)\nnew teachers (6) talk to me; I will probably get all\nsweaty.\nImage: Standing alone in\nbackyard as other teachers talk\nHOT THOUGHT: No one will\nwant to be my friend.\nThought I want to examine: No one will want to be my friend.\nEvidence for My Thought Evidence Against My Thought\n\u2022 No one has made an effort to talk to me. \u2022 I had some friends in my previous school.\n\u2022 I am alone at recess and lunch. \u2022 Rita and Faiza are good friends; ate lunch\ntogether, worked on the school play; hung\n\u2022 Other teachers do not say hi when I get to\nout on weekends; went out as couples; still\nschool in the morning.\ncall to see if I want to do something; Faiza\n\u2022 In high school, some girls started rumors brought a cake\nand I lost almost all my friends.\n\u2022 Friends from college whom I still see\n\u2022 Friends from the neighborhood\nTry to think of a balanced thought that captures all of the evidence. Write it down so you can\ncompare it to the one Suzanne came up with.\nTherapist: It seems to me that when you think, No one will want to be my friend, you are only considering the evidence that supports your thought. What happens when you consider all of the\nevidence?\nSuzanne: I guess that it doesn\u2019t seem to be so true.\nTherapist: In what way is it not so true?\nSuzanne: Well, I do have friends who like me and want to be my friend. I think one of the problems\nis that I have been avoiding my friends from my old school.\n[Page 176]\nLook for Evidence and Create Balanced Thoughts 165\nTherapist: I think you are right; we discovered that you have quite a few friends who like you. What\nwould be a thought that captures all of the evidence?\nSuzanne: Well, I guess, even though I haven\u2019t yet made friends at my new school, I had friends in the\npast and there really is no reason I won\u2019t have friends in the future.\nIs Suzanne\u2019s balanced thought better than the one you came up with? My clients often come up with far\nbetter balanced thoughts than I could ever have \u201ctold\u201d them. Your job as a therapist is now easy\u2014you just\nneed to reinforce and consolidate the balanced thought.\nThere are two tasks left before completing the thought record. First, ask your client how much she\nbelieves the thought from 0 to 100 percent. Even if she gives a fairly low score, it is still a start to believing a new balanced thought. Second, ask your client if she believed the balanced thought, how would\nthis affect her feelings, and ask her to rerate her original feelings. Suzanne believed her balanced\nthought 75 percent. She rerated her feelings Nervous: 5, Worried: 5, and Embarrassed: 4.\nCONSOLIDATE THE BALANCED THOUGHT\nYou have just spent a great deal of time and effort creating a balanced thought. It is worth spending\na bit more time to consolidate this thought. First, be sure to smile and express interest in your client\u2019s\nbalanced thought. Your enthusiasm is reinforcing. Second, review the balanced thought in as many\nways as you can. Here are some suggestions.\n\u2022 Say the balanced thought out loud and add a compliment. For example, I might repeat the\nbalanced thought and say, \u201cI like the way the balanced thought captures all of the evidence.\u201d\n\u2022 Ask your client if she would like to write down the balanced thought so that she can remember\nit. My clients have written their balanced thoughts on coping cards, kept the balanced thoughts\non their phones, or made the balanced thought into their screen saver.\n\u2022 Ask your client to repeat the balanced thought out loud. Depending on the balanced thought,\nI might ask my client to try a more assertive tone, or a more compassionate, gentle tone.\n\u2022 Ask your client to regularly review the balanced thought. I find it helpful to specify a set time\nto review, such as first thing in the morning.\nDevelop a metaphor or an image. Often a balanced thought is fairly long and complex and can be\nhard to remember. It can be helpful to create an image of the evidence that is the most compelling for\nyour client and attach it to the balanced thought. An image that symbolizes the balanced thought, a\nmetaphor, or even a shortened version can increase the emotional strength of the balanced thought\nand make it more memorable (Hackmann et al., 2011; Josefowitz, 2017). Here is Suzanne\u2019s shortened\nversion of her balanced thought: Hang in there, you will make friends again.\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 8.4: Suzanne Reviews Her Balanced Thought\nPractice reviewing a balanced thought.\n[Page 177]\n166 CBT Made Simple\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 8.4: Create Balanced Thoughts\nUSE BALANCED THOUGHTS TO CREATE A NEW IMAGE\nWhen Suzanne\u2019s therapist initially asked her about her thoughts and images, Suzanne reported\nthat she had an image of herself alone in the principal\u2019s backyard while the other teachers talked to\neach other. Once you have examined the evidence against the hot thought and created a balanced\nthought, you can go back and directly modify your client\u2019s original image. Given the close connection\nbetween imagery and emotion, this can be a very powerful intervention. Let\u2019s see how Suzanne\u2019s therapist helps her create a new image.\nTherapist: You started out with a very clear image of yourself standing in the principal\u2019s backyard,\nawkward and alone, as the other teachers talked together.\nSuzanne: That\u2019s right, I wasn\u2019t even aware that I had that image until you asked.\nTherapist: Given the evidence that we just looked at, and your balanced thought, how accurate do\nyou think your original image is?\nSuzanne: (laughing softly) Probably not accurate at all.\nTherapist: I think it would be really helpful if we could develop a more realistic image of what you\nthink will happen. Could we try?\nSuzanne: When I look at the evidence, and I really think about it, a more realistic image would be\nof my standing in the principal\u2019s backyard talking to the other teachers, or at least being\npart of the group, even if I am not talking.\nSuzanne\u2019s therapist thought this was a good start for a new image. However, the initial negative image was\nvery detailed and vivid. Suzanne\u2019s therapist wanted the new image to be as compelling.\nTherapist: Can you tell me a little bit more about this new image?\nSuzanne: Well, I see myself standing there with my drink, and I am part of a small group. I am listening as one of the other teachers says something.\nTherapist: Can you get a clear picture in your mind of this new image?\nSuzanne: Yes, I can see it clearly (smiling).\nTherapist: And how do you feel when you get this image?\nSuzanne: A lot more relaxed about going, and a lot less depressed. Almost makes me wonder if it\ncould be a good experience.\nAfter they had developed this new image, Suzanne\u2019s therapist asked her to consciously practice\nseeing the new image three times a day. They discussed specific times that Suzanne could practice. Her\n[Page 178]\nLook for Evidence and Create Balanced Thoughts 167\ntherapist told Suzanne that the practice could be very short, even a few minutes, but it was important\nto practice regularly.\nUSE BALANCED THOUGHTS TO MANAGE STRESS\nBalanced thoughts generally move your client away from extreme thinking, such as No one will like\nme, to more balanced thinking that generally helps with anxiety and depression as well as self-esteem.\nBalanced thoughts provide a more resilient attitude toward life\u2019s stressors. As we discussed earlier, most\nclients have typical negative thoughts that tend to recur. This means that the balanced thoughts you\ndevelop for one situation will most likely also be relevant to other situations.\nWhen Suzanne\u2019s therapist asked if there were other situations where she had the thought No one\nwill want to be my friend, Suzanne said she had this thought \u201call the time.\u201d Her therapist asked for\nexamples, and Suzanne replied that she often had these thoughts when she was alone at school during\nrecess and lunch and at the end of the day when she left without saying good-bye to anyone. If you look\nat all of these situations, the thought No one will want to be my friend leads to Suzanne feeling depressed\nand withdrawing from the other teachers, making it almost impossible to make friends, leading to a\nvicious cycle where it seemed true that no one wanted to be her friend.\nSuzanne\u2019s therapist asked her, \u201cInstead of thinking, No one will want to be my friend, if you thought\nyour new balanced thought, Hang in there, you will make friends again, how do you think you would\nfeel?\u201d Suzanne smiled as she responded that she would be less depressed. Suzanne and her therapist\nproblem solved how she could remember her new balanced thought in the other situations when she\nstarts thinking, No one will want to be my friend. Suzanne\u2019s therapist also encouraged her to notice if she\nhad any unrealistic images in these situations.\nSometimes, completing a thought record influences how your client wants to behave. After Suzanne\ndeveloped a balanced thought, she turned toward her therapist and said, \u201cI have been really silly about\nthe barbecue. I would like to go. It would be good to meet the other teachers, and there is no reason to\nbe so anxious.\u201d Let\u2019s see how Suzanne\u2019s therapist could help her use her balanced thought.\nTherapist: When you think about it, you would like to go to the barbecue.\nSuzanne: I think it would be a good thing to do. I want to make friends at my new school, and it\u2019s\njust silly to avoid social events because of my anxiety.\nTherapist: After we did the thought record, you came up with a really good balanced thought; do you\nremember what it was?\nSuzanne: Yes, it was, Hang in there, you will make friends again.\nTherapist: That\u2019s right. I am wondering if you could remember your balanced thought when you\nthink of going to the barbecue, if that would help with your anxiety.\nSuzanne: I think it would.\nTherapist: Sounds like a great plan.\n[Page 179]\n168 CBT Made Simple\nCHECKLIST OF COMMON PROBLEMS WITH THOUGHT RECORDS\nThought records are generally an effective intervention; however, some are more helpful than\nothers. Below is a checklist you can use to check that a thought record is well done. You can find a copy\nof Checklist of Common Problems with Thought Records at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\nG Is the situation a factual description of what occurred?\nG Did my client identify and rate his or her feelings?\nG Did my client identify his physical reactions?\nG Is the behavior a factual description of what my client did?\nG Is the thought my client wants to focus on a hot thought?\nG Is the thought about self, others, or the future?\nG Is the thought related to his or her negative feelings?\nG Does the evidence against address the hot thought?\nG Does the balanced thought address the hot thought?\nIt is important that the evidence you gather challenge the hot thought you are working on. For\nexample, a colleague had passed Raoul in the hall and had not said hi. Raoul thought, My colleague is\navoiding me. His evidence against his thought was, My bowling buddies are happy to see me. This evidence will help Raoul feel better, but it is not related to the thought, My colleague is avoiding me. In this\nsituation you need to keep exploring Raoul\u2019s thoughts using Questions to Identify Evidence Against\nNegative Thoughts to find evidence related to the hot thought you are working on.\nIt is equally important that the balanced thought directly address the hot thought. For example, if\nthe original thought was about self, the balanced thought needs to be about self; if the original thought\nwas about others, the balanced thought needs to be about others. When Raoul was assigned to work\nwith junior colleagues, his original thought was My boss doesn\u2019t respect me. After examining the evidence for and against, his initial balanced thought was I work very hard and do a good job. This is a\ngenerally helpful thought that will increase Raoul\u2019s positive mood. If I were his therapist, I would be\ndelighted that he was able to have such a positive thought about himself. However, the hot thought was\nabout others (his boss), and the balanced thought needs to also be about others. A better balanced\nthought would be, Even though I was asked to work with junior colleagues, this does not mean my boss does\nnot respect me. There is a lot of evidence that my boss still respects me and my work.\nIt is helpful to keep this list in mind when examining your clients\u2019 thought records. Take a moment\nafter your session is over and on your own review your client\u2019s thought record, using the checklist.

We\u2019ll also see how a problem-solving approach can\nhelp Raoul and Suzanne address the various issues they bring up in therapy.\nAgenda Item #1: What is problem solving?\nAgenda Item #2: Develop a positive problem orientation.\nAgenda Item #3: Identify your client\u2019s problems.\nAgenda Item #4: Brainstorm solutions.\nAgenda Item #5: Choose a solution.\nAgenda Item #6: Develop coping thoughts.\nWork the Agenda\nOne of the strengths of CBT is the universality of the approaches. All people encounter problems, and\neveryone can benefit from a step-by-step approach to solving them.\n[Page 185]\n174 CBT Made Simple\nAgenda Item #1: What Is Problem Solving?\nProblem-solving therapy was originally developed by D\u2019Zurilla and Goldfried (1971), and although\nit has been revised over the years (D\u2019Zurilla & Nezu, 2006), the core process and principles have\nremained essentially the same.\nOVERVIEW OF THE PROBLEM-SOLVING PROCESS\nProblem solving involves both an attitude that problems can be solved or at least improved, and a\nprocess based on a specific set of skills. The process of problem solving has four distinct steps. For many\nclients, you will want to go through the whole problem-solving process step by step; however, for some\nclients, you may use only parts of the process. Below are the four steps.\n1. Identify the problem and set realistic goals.\n2. Generate new solutions. This is often called brainstorming.\n3. Evaluate the different solutions and decide which one to try.\n4. Try one of the solutions: evaluate the consequences and decide whether the problem is solved\nor whether you need to continue to problem solve.\nYou can find the Problem-Solving Worksheet at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501. The worksheet summarizes the steps and includes helpful questions for each section. You can use the worksheet\nas a guide for therapy as well as a handout to give your clients.\nTHE THEORY BEHIND PROBLEM SOLVING\nThe theory underlying problem solving is that clients\u2019 emotional distress is due to poor problemsolving skills which lead to dysfunctional ways of coping. Poor problem solving leads to more problems,\nwhich in turn are poorly solved. Clients quickly find themselves dealing with multiple problems and it\nbecomes a vicious negative cycle. Problem solving stops the vicious cycle and helps clients find better\nways to cope (D\u2019Zurilla & Nezu, 2010).\nProblem-Solving Theory\nGood Problem Solving = Better Coping = Improved Life and Better Mood\nWhen you help your client find solutions to his problems, you are also saying, \u201cYou matter, I care\nabout your welfare, and together we can figure out how to address your problems.\u201d These are very powerful messages. For many clients the whole problem-solving process feels new and empowering.\n[Page 186]\nProblem Solving\u2014Finding a Better Way 175\nIS PROBLEM SOLVING EFFECTIVE?\nLet\u2019s look at the research. Good problem-solving skills are consistently associated with better\noverall emotional adjustment, and poor problem-solving skills are associated with more distress and\npoorer adjustment (D\u2019Zurilla & Nezu, 2010). For example, poor problem-solving skills are related to\ndrug and alcohol addiction, criminal behavior, and psychological distress. The good news is that individuals with good problem-solving skills are less likely to become depressed after a stressful event\n(Nezu, Nezu, Saraydarian, Kalmar, & Ronan, 1986).\nOver the past three decades, a large number of studies have demonstrated that problem solving is\nan effective treatment for depression (Bell & D\u2019Zurilla, 2009), anxiety, and a variety of other mental\nhealth problems (D\u2019Zurilla & Nezu, 2010; Malouff, Thorsteinsson, & Schutte, 2007). Problem solving\nhas also helped people learn to cope with serious physical illnesses such as diabetes (Glasgow, Toobert,\nBarrera, & Stryker, 2004) and cancer (Nezu, Nezu, Felgoise, McClure, & Houts, 2003). Interventions\nthat focus on developing a positive problem-solving attitude as well as teaching problem-solving skills\nseem to be the most effective (Bell & D\u2019Zurilla, 2009).\nResearch Summary\nPositive Problem-Solving Orientation + Problem-Solving Skills = Effective Treatment\nAgenda Item #2: Develop a Positive Problem Orientation\nA positive problem orientation is a core element of good problem solving. The table below compares the beliefs of individuals with positive and negative problem orientations (Nezu, Nezu, &\nD\u2019Zurilla, 2013).\nCharacteristics of a Positive and\nNegative Problem Orientation\nPositive Problem Orientation Negative Problem Orientation\n\u2022 Problems are a challenge. It is possible to \u2022 Problems are unsolvable and frightening. It is\nimprove most situations. useless to try to improve most situations.\n\u2022 One has the ability to successfully solve \u2022 One does not have the ability to successfully\nproblems or make the situation better. solve problems or make the situation better.\n\u2022 Successful problem solving takes time, effort, \u2022 Initial failure means the problem cannot be\nand persistence. Initial failure is part of solved.\nfinding a solution.\n[Page 187]\n176 CBT Made Simple\nIndividuals with a positive problem orientation see difficulties as normal life challenges and try to\nfind solutions to their problems. Individuals with a negative problem orientation tend to either avoid\ntheir problems or approach them with an impulsive or careless problem-solving style. Clearly, a positive\norientation is better, but how do you help your clients develop one?\nModeling optimism and having faith in your client\u2019s ability to problem solve is one of the most\neffective ways to help your client develop a positive problem orientation. Here are some phrases I use to\nencourage a positive problem-solving orientation:\n\u2022 Let\u2019s see if we can find a way to solve your problems.\n\u2022 I wonder if there is something you can do that will help this situation.\n\u2022 I know it feels hopeless, but I wonder if we could find a way to make things even a little better\nfor you.\n\u2022 I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve looked at all of the possible solutions. Would you be willing to try to problem\nsolve?\nSuch relatively simple interventions communicate that you believe in your client\u2019s ability to find a\nbetter solution, and that together you will be able to improve his life. You will also find that as your\nclient uses the problem-solving process successfully, his problem orientation will start to automatically\nbecome more positive.\nLet\u2019s see how Raoul\u2019s therapist helps him develop a more positive problem orientation. Raoul was\ntelling his therapist about his poor relationship with his boss, who gave him a poor work evaluation.\nRaoul: I feel so depressed when I think of going to work. I used to like going to work, but I feel so\nawkward and anxious with my boss since I received the poor work evaluation. I think we\nhave a terrible relationship. It just seems hopeless to do anything about it.\nTherapist: I hear you\u2019re thinking that it is hopeless to try and change your relationship with your boss,\nis that right?\nHis therapist has identified a negative problem orientation: It is hopeless to try and change the relationship\nwith his boss.\nRaoul: Definitely, what can I do?\nTherapist: I am wondering if you would be willing to put aside the thought that it is hopeless to do\nanything and see if we could find some better ways to cope with the situation, to help you\nfeel better.\nRaoul: What do you mean?\nTherapist: Well, when you tell yourself that it\u2019s hopeless, how does that affect your behavior?\nRaoul: I just avoid him, and keep doing the same old thing.\nTherapist: And does avoiding help?\n[Page 188]\nProblem Solving\u2014Finding a Better Way 177\nRaoul: No, in fact, it is getting worse. I just feel more and more awkward.\nTherapist: I am wondering if you would be willing to work with me to see if we could problem solve\nsome different ways of coping with your boss that might improve the situation.\nRaoul: I would be willing, but I don\u2019t think we will find any.\nTherapist: You may be right, but I want to see if we put our heads together if we could find a better\nway for you to cope.\nNotice how the therapist acknowledges that Raoul might be right but asks him to try problem solving. The\ntherapist is modeling a calm, thoughtful approach to the problem.\nAgenda Item #3: Identify Your Client\u2019s Problems\nBefore your client can solve his problems, he needs to identify them. Defining the problem and\nsetting realistic goals are the first components of a problem-solving skill set. Problems can be a one-time\nevent, such as a divorce or a serious health problem. They can be situations that happen fairly regularly,\nsuch as disciplining a child who refuses to do chores, fighting over finances with a partner, or dealing\nwith constant daily difficulties such as a long commute to work, chronic pain, or loneliness.\nSometimes it is very clear that a client needs help problem solving. A client may start therapy\nsaying, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do about X,\u201d or one of your client\u2019s thoughts may be, What else can I do?\nor I don\u2019t know how to handle this. In other cases, it can be more difficult to identify your client\u2019s need\nto problem solve. Clients with a negative problem orientation often avoid their problems but feel\nanxious. It is helpful to teach a client who tends to avoid that if he is anxious, he should ask himself\nwhether there is a problem he is not looking at.\nPROBLEM DEFINITION\nThe more specific and concrete the problem, the easier it will be to think of helpful solutions. For\nexample, \u201cI don\u2019t communicate well with my partner\u201d is a very vague problem and hard to start solving,\nwhereas, \u201cMy partner and I don\u2019t agree on how to discipline our children\u201d is much clearer and an easier\nproblem to address.\nRaoul had started his therapy session by saying in a low voice, \u201cI feel so depressed when I think of\ngoing to work. I used to like work, but I feel so awkward and anxious with my boss since I received the\npoor work evaluation. I think we have a terrible relationship. It just seems hopeless to do anything\nabout it.\u201d\nAt this point, Raoul\u2019s problem is not very specific. His therapist uses the questions under \u201cQuestions\nto Help Define the Problem\u201d in the Problem-Solving Worksheet to help Raoul become more specific\nand concrete. Sometimes you may want to use all of the questions, and sometimes only a few may be\nrelevant. You can find Raoul\u2019s answers in the table below.\n[Page 189]\n178 CBT Made Simple\nRaoul Defines His Problem\nQuestions to Help Define the Problem Raoul\u2019s Answers\nWhat happened or did not happen that bothers 1.

Where does the problem The problem involves Raoul and his boss; it\nhappen? When does the problem happen? happens at work during the day.\nWhy is this problem difficult for your client? 1. Raoul feels ashamed about the poor work\nevaluation.\n2. Raoul feels judged, hates work, has trouble\nconcentrating, and thinks everyone knows\nabout his problems with his boss.\n3. Raoul does not know what to do about the\npoor evaluation.\nWhat does your client currently do to handle Raoul tries to avoid interacting with his boss. In\nthe problem? Is your client avoiding or acting in the past, Raoul used to drop by his boss\u2019s office\nan impulsive manner? in the morning for a five-minute chat; he used to\nask his boss for his opinion on a project. Now\nRaoul goes straight to his desk.\nWhat does your client hope will happen as a Raoul hopes \u201cthings will go back to normal.\u201d\nconsequence of his/her behavior?\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 9.1: Nasir Has a Busy Clinic\nPractice defining your clients\u2019 problems.\n[Page 190]\nProblem Solving\u2014Finding a Better Way 179\nSETTING GOALS\nBoth Raoul and his therapist now have a much better sense of his problems. The next step is\nsetting goals. Goals need to be specific and concrete, realistic, and possible to accomplish. You also\nwant to articulate both short-term and long-term goals. For example, a short-term goal might be becoming more assertive with your boss and asking for an extra two weeks of holiday time during the Christmas\nseason, but that might conflict with the long-term goal of being seen as a team player and getting a\npromotion.\nOften after your client answers the questions to help define the problem on the Problem-Solving\nWorksheet, his goals are clear. If your client\u2019s goals are not clear, the following questions may be helpful.\n\u2022 How would your client like the situation to change or be different?\n\u2022 How would your client like other people in the situation to change or be different?\n\u2022 How would your client like to change or be different?\nWhen Raoul\u2019s therapist asked how he would like the situation to change, Raoul responded that he\nwanted \u201ceverything to go back to normal.\u201d This is not a very specific goal. His therapist then asked how\nhe would like his boss to change and if there were ways that he would like to change. Raoul explained\nthat generally he wanted to have a good relationship with his boss again. He wanted his boss to joke\nwith him and talk to him easily. He also wanted to be comfortable asking his boss for his opinion about\nprojects. As Raoul articulated his goals, he realized that he also wanted to understand his negative\nwork evaluation better. When a client slows down and examines his problems and goals, he often realizes aspects of the problem that are important to him that he had not focused on before.\nYou can also identify goals by paying attention to what your client hopes will happen as a consequence of his current behavior. As ineffective as their behavior may be, most people act in a way that\nthey hope will make their situation better. In Raoul\u2019s case his therapist could have asked, \u201cWhat are\nyou hoping will happen when you avoid your boss?\u201d\nOnce you have identified your client\u2019s goals and explored what he hopes will happen as a consequence of his behavior, it is important to examine the actual consequences of his behavior. Unless your\nclient understands that his behavior is ineffective, he will not be motivated to problem solve. In Raoul\u2019s\ncase, he hoped that by avoiding his boss everything would \u201cgo back to normal.\u201d When his therapist\nasked Raoul what were the consequences of avoiding, Raoul quietly acknowledged that it was not\nhelping, and was in fact making things worse.\nEXPLAIN PROBLEM SOLVING TO YOUR CLIENT\nOnce you have established that what your client is currently doing is not working, it is a good time\nto explain problem solving. You want to give your client an overview of the process and instill hope that\nproblem solving can help. Here is how I explain problem solving (you can find a copy of this script at\nhttp://www.newharbinger.com/38501):\nWe have been talking about your problem and how hopeless you feel. Sometimes people get\ninto negative cycles and don\u2019t see alternative possibilities. I am wondering if you would be\nwilling to see if we could find some other ways of coping with your problem. I want to explain\n[Page 191]\n180 CBT Made Simple\na process called problem solving. We start with identifying a specific problem and then we\nbrainstorm to try to think of different possible solutions. We are looking for as many solutions\nas we can find, without judging them. Once we have thought of some alternative ways of handling your problem, I want to spend some time evaluating the different solutions to see if there\nis one that makes more sense. Would you be willing to try?\nYour Turn!\n\uf0b2\nPractice in Your Imagination: Explain Problem Solving\nI would like you to imagine explaining problem solving to a client. Before you start, rate from 1 to 10\nhow comfortable you feel explaining problem solving. At the end of the exercise, rate your level of\ncomfort again to see if it changed. Now, let\u2019s try this exercise.\nChoose a specific client who you think would benefit from a problem-solving approach. Imagine\nthat your client has identified a problem and you want to explain problem solving. Try to get a picture\nof him or her in your mind. Imagine yourself in your office with your client. See your office; notice the\nsounds and smells in the room. Read over how I suggest explaining problem solving while imagining\nyourself saying the words. You can also use your own phrases. Really hear and feel yourself explaining\nproblem solving. Imagine explaining problem solving two more times with the same client. Each time,\nimagine that your client responds positively.\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 9.1: Define the Problem and Set Goals\nAgenda Item #4: Brainstorm Solutions\nThe next phase involves helping your client find new solutions for his problem. Finding new solutions to problems is difficult\u2014if clients knew of better ways to manage their lives, they would already\nbe doing things differently. Problem solving involves asking your client to step outside of his usual\nmind-set. You want to engage in a process called brainstorming, which means coming up with as many\nvaried solutions as you can. When brainstorming, it is helpful to follow these three principles:\n\u2022 Quantity: Try to generate as many solutions as possible.\n\u2022 Variety: The greater the variety of solutions, the more chances that you will have a good idea.\n\u2022 Deferred Judgment: Write down all solutions that come to mind, no matter how silly, irrelevant, or outrageous.\nInclude a few far-fetched and seemingly impossible solutions; they can help your client think outside\nthe box. Sometimes combining a far-fetched solution with another solution can lead to a good\nsolution.\n[Page 192]\nProblem Solving\u2014Finding a Better Way 181\nFINDING NEW SOLUTIONS\nIt can be very hard not to jump in and solve your client\u2019s problems. Ideally, brainstorming new solutions is a collaboration between therapist and client. The more your client can discover his own solutions, the more empowering the process will be. I start with asking my client for his suggestions. Often,\nall I need to say is, \u201cI wonder if there are some other ways of handling this situation.\u201d If I think of a\nspecific strategy that my client did not mention, I usually say, \u201cI have an idea that might help. Let\u2019s see\nif you like it.\u201d If my client likes the suggestion, I encourage him to apply the strategy to his specific\nproblem.\nFor many of your clients, the process of stopping and consciously looking at their problems will\nnaturally lead to thinking of new, effective solutions. However, some clients find it hard to think of\nalternative ways of handling their problems. Try the \u201cQuestions to Help Find New Solutions\u201d list on\nthe Problem-Solving Worksheet. Below are the questions.\n\u2022 What are some different ways you could handle your problem?\n\u2022 What would you suggest to someone who had this problem?\n\u2022 What do you think a friend or someone who cared for you would suggest if he or she knew that\nyou had this problem?\n\u2022 How have you handled similar situations in the past?\n\u2022 How do you overcome obstacles in other areas of your life?\n\u2022 Is there any positive information that you are ignoring that could be helpful in solving this\nproblem?\n\u2022 Is there an aspect of the problem that cannot be changed and that you have to accept? (The\nchallenge is to accept what cannot be changed and find coping strategies for what can be\nchanged.)\nLet\u2019s see how Raoul\u2019s therapist helps him brainstorm. Initially Raoul has some difficulty finding\nalternative solutions. However, his therapist maintains an optimistic attitude and sticks to problem\nsolving.\nTherapist: Right now you are avoiding your boss, and you were saying that it doesn\u2019t seem to be\nimproving the situation. Let\u2019s see if we can think of some other things you could do. I\nwant us to write down everything we think of. In this early stage, we\u2019re looking for quantity and variety of solutions. Every idea is a good idea. Later we\u2019ll figure out which one we\nwant to use.\nNotice how his therapist explains the principles of quantity, variety, and deferred judgment.\nRaoul: Anything I can think of just seems impossible.\nTherapist: You may be right, but let\u2019s see if we can think of what you could do to improve your relationship with your boss.\n[Page 193]\n182 CBT Made Simple\nNotice that Raoul\u2019s therapist acknowledges that he might be right but maintains an optimistic attitude.\nRaoul: I think that the best solution may be to get out of the department and ask for a transfer.\nTherapist: So one option is to ask for a transfer. Any other options you can think of?\nRaoul: I could just keep doing what I am doing; it is not going so badly. I\u2019ve also thought of asking\na friend who works in another department if he had any ideas.\nTherapist: We have a couple of solutions; let\u2019s write them down. First, ask for a transfer; second, keep\ndoing what you are doing; and third, ask a friend for advice. I\u2019m going to ask you some\nquestions to see if they help you come up with any other solutions. I\u2019m wondering\u2026if a\ncolleague had this problem, what would you suggest to him?\nNotice how Raoul\u2019s therapist starts with a summary statement to indicate she heard Raoul, and then\nfollows up with a question from the \u201cQuestions to Help Find New Solutions\u201d list.\nRaoul: That\u2019s easy, but I don\u2019t think it would work for me.\nTherapist: You might be right, but let\u2019s look at what you would suggest in any case.\nRaoul: Well, the first thing I would suggest is that my colleague stop avoiding his boss and behave\nin a friendly manner.\nYour Turn!\nHelp Raoul Find New Solutions\nRaoul\u2019s suggestion that he stop avoiding his boss and behave in a friendly manner is a good overall\nstrategy, but it is not very concrete.\nLook at the three possible responses below and pick the one that will help Raoul be more specific\nand concrete.\n1. Great suggestion. I wonder if you started generally participating more in meetings whether that\nwould be helpful.\n2. When you think of being friendlier, what are your thoughts?\n3. If your colleague wanted to stop avoiding his boss and be friendlier, what are some things he\ncould do?\nResponse #3 is the most likely to help Raoul develop specific and concrete solutions. In response #1,\nthe therapist is solving the problem for Raoul. Response #2 would be a good question if we had a\nspecific, concrete solution, but it is too soon in the problem-solving process.\nTherapist: I f your colleague wanted to generally stop avoiding his boss and be friendlier,\nwhat are some things he could do?\n[Page 194]\nProblem Solving\u2014Finding a Better Way 183\nRaoul: (laughing slightly) Well, I guess I would suggest saying hello to his boss before\nmeetings, speaking up at meetings, and probably letting his boss know how some\nof his projects are going.\nTherapist: C ould we put these down as possible solutions for you? (Raoul nods and smiles.)\nYou\u2019ve come up with quite a long list.\nLook at the three possible responses below and pick the one that will help Raoul continue to find\nalternative solutions.\n1. I\u2019m wondering whether we could find more solutions. What would someone who knew you well\nsuggest as a solution?\n2. What are the obstacles to starting to speak up at meetings?\n3. Let\u2019s make a plan for when you could start speaking up more at meetings.\nResponse #1 is the most likely to help Raoul continue to find solutions. Responses #2 and #3 would\nbe good responses if Raoul had already picked speaking up at meetings as a solution; however, he has\nnot yet finished listing all of his possible solutions.\nTherapist: I \u2019m wondering whether we could find more solutions. What would someone who\nknew you well suggest as a solution?\nRaoul: Honestly? I think my wife would suggest that I wait until the next evaluation,\nwhich is in six months, before I do anything. My daughter would suggest that I\nmake an appointment with my boss to talk about the poor work evaluation. But\nthat\u2019s totally impossible for me to do. I would just be too anxious.\nOften when clients think of an assertive response, they immediately back away. It just feels too\nhard. That\u2019s what happened when Raoul thought of talking to his boss about his poor work evaluation.\nIt is worthwhile spending some time exploring what exactly your client could say. Often when clients\nhave a concrete scenario, the assertive response feels more doable.\nHere is Raoul\u2019s list of possible solutions:\n\u2022 Keep doing what I am doing\n\u2022 Ask for a transfer to another department\n\u2022 Ask a friend for advice\n\u2022 Talk to my boss before meetings, participate in meetings, and tell my boss how my projects\nare going\n\u2022 Wait for next evaluation\n\u2022 Arrange a meeting with my boss to discuss my evaluation\n[Page 195]\n184 CBT Made Simple\nAgenda Item #5: Choose a Solution\nFor many clients, calmly evaluating different solutions is a new and empowering experience. You\nwant your client to evaluate the likelihood that the different solutions will either resolve or improve the\nproblem. I teach my clients to ask themselves the following questions from the Problem-Solving\nWorksheet so that they can make an informed choice.\n\u2022 What are the short-term and long-term benefits of each solution?\n\u2022 What are the short-term and long-term drawbacks of each solution?\nIf my client finds the concept of benefits and drawbacks too abstract, I ask, \u201cIf you use this solution,\nwhat are some of the good things that might happen and what are some of the bad things that might\nhappen?\u201d We make a chart and write down the answers; clients can then take the chart home and\nspend more time thinking about the decision. Below are some of the questions that I ask to encourage\nclients to think about the short-term and long-term consequences of each solution.\n\u2022 How will this solution affect me, other people, and the situation?\n\u2022 How will I feel after implementing this solution?\n\u2022 Is this solution consistent with my values? Will implementing this solution be important to me\nin terms of acting on my values?\n\u2022 Does the solution generally feel doable?\n\u2022 Does the solution feel doable in terms of time and effort required?\nRaoul has a large number of solutions; it\u2019s hard to evaluate all of them. His therapist asked him to\npick three solutions to evaluate. Below is how Raoul completed his evaluation. You can download the\nworksheet Benefits and Drawbacks of My Solutions at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\n[Page 196]\nProblem Solving\u2014Finding a Better Way 185\nBenefits and Drawbacks of My Solutions\nSolution Short-Term Short-Term Long-Term Long-Term\nBenefit Drawback Benefit Drawback\nAsk for a transfer Will get me out I have to tell my It might lead to a I lose some of\nof the office boss, and until I better situation my seniority if\nleave it will be I change\nA change might\nworse departments\nbe good\nApplying for a Next job might\ntransfer is be worse\ndifficult, hard to\nget a good\nreference, can\ntake a long time\nTalk more with Relationship Does not address Relationship Still do not\nboss; discuss might improve the poor work might improve understand poor\nprojects, etc. evaluation work evaluation\nFairly easy to do\nMeet with boss to Might resolve Might make it Ideally will help Might make it\ndiscuss poor work the issue worse; could find with relationship impossible to\nevaluation out boss very and work stay in job\ncritical of my work performance\nHigh anxiety\nOnce Raoul and his therapist had evaluated the three solutions, his therapist asked him to summarize the benefits and drawbacks of each solution.\nAsking for a transfer: It might make me feel good initially, but it will be a lot of work and may not lead\nto a better solution. Plus, I lose my seniority.\nTalk more with the boss: It might help with the relationship. There is no real risk. Only problem is\nthat it does not address the poor work evaluation.\nMeet with boss to discuss poor work evaluation: The most high risk and the hardest. Might be the\nbest solution, but might make it hard to stay.\nWhen Raoul evaluated the different solutions, it was clear that asking for a transfer was not a\ngood idea. He decided he wanted to start with dropping by his boss\u2019s office to chat and also try talking\nto his boss about different projects he was working on. He wanted to see what happened when he\nstarted talking more to his boss before deciding whether he wanted to discuss his poor work evaluation with him.\n[Page 197]\n186 CBT Made Simple\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 9.2: Brainstorm and Choose a Solution\nMAKE A PLAN\nNext, your client needs to develop a plan for implementing the solution he chose. Make sure that\nthe plan is specific and concrete. It is helpful to write out what your client will actually do. Next, specify\na first step to the plan and a time and date when your client will try the first step to the solution. You\nalso want to check if there are any obstacles to the plan, and try to address them.\nRaoul decided he wanted to try dropping by his boss\u2019s office the next day. He had meetings on\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday, and he would make a point of getting there early to chat with his boss\nbefore the meeting.\nPREPARE FOR THE WORST\nSometimes your client wants to try a solution where there is a realistic possibility of a negative\noutcome. For example, my client Julia decided to disclose to her partner that she had been sexually\nabused as a child, even though she knew there was a realistic possibility her partner would blame her\nfor the abuse. Other clients have raised various difficult issues with their bosses, partners, and friends,\nhoping to improve the relationship, but instead the discussion resulted in increased tension. You want\nto be sure your client understands the realistic risk of a negative reaction and is prepared for that should\nit occur.\nUSE IMAGERY TO PRACTICE\nRehearsing using imagery is an opportunity to practice the new solution and to check if there are\nany obstacles. I ask my client to imagine doing the new solution in his mind. I encourage my client to\nclose his eyes, and I describe him carrying out the new solution. I ask him to see and feel himself in the\nsituation, and if the solution involves talking, to hear himself and the other people. After he has imagined doing the solution once, I ask him to open his eyes and I ask if there were any obstacles, or if he\nwould like to change anything. We address the obstacles. I then ask him to imagine doing the new\nsolution two more times and incorporate any changes he wanted. I ask my client to rate how doable the\nsolution is before and after practicing in his mind.\nWhen Raoul imagined dropping by his boss\u2019s office to chat, he realized it would be easier if he had\na specific question about a file that he wanted to ask. His therapist incorporated that into the next two\nimaginal rehearsals.\nYOUR CLIENT TRIES HIS NEW SOLUTION\nThink of your client\u2019s new solution as an experiment that will provide additional data, rather than\nthe one right way to proceed. Often clients prematurely dismiss a solution because the outcome wasn\u2019t\nperfect. Results need to be evaluated on a continuum rather than a \u201cperfect or else failure\u201d yardstick.\nIt is helpful to decide ahead of time how your client will evaluate whether his new solution is successful. If the solution did not work out, or if aspects of the problem remain, you need to continue to\n[Page 198]\nProblem Solving\u2014Finding a Better Way 187\nproblem solve. It may also be helpful to reevaluate what aspects of the problem can and cannot be\nchanged. The reality is that many of life\u2019s difficulties take time and effort to address, and often there\nis no perfect solution.\nIt is also important to teach your client to give himself a pat on the back for trying his new solution.\nEven if the new solution did not work out, trying indicates a willingness to attempt to solve the problem\nrather than staying stuck. I model a positive problem orientation. Depending on what happened, some\nof the statements I use are, \u201cThat went well,\u201d \u201cTrying is an important first step,\u201d and \u201cEven though it\nwasn\u2019t perfect, it is a step in the right direction.\u201d\nSUZANNE PROBLEM SOLVES\nIf you remember, in the last chapter we helped Suzanne manage her anxiety about going to the\nbarbecue by looking at her hot thought and developing a more balanced thought. Her worry had\ndecreased sufficiently that she decided to go to the barbecue. However, she still worried that she would\nnot know what to say and that the other teachers would not talk to her.\nHer therapist thought it would be helpful to problem solve what Suzanne could do to make the\nbarbecue easier for her. They came up with a number of strategies, including offering to help with any\nfood preparation and the cooking; thinking of some questions she could ask that might start a conversation, such as how long the other teachers had been at the school and whether they had children;\napproaching the other teachers, introducing herself, and standing there as part of the group; focusing\nher attention on what the other teachers were saying; and spending some time playing with the principal\u2019s young children.\nWhen Suzanne evaluated the different solutions, she picked offering to help with the cooking,\nthinking of some questions she could ask to start a conversation, and then approaching one of the\nteachers at the party and starting to talk. She felt a lot better once she had a plan.\nAgenda Item #6: Develop Coping Thoughts\nOnce your client has decided how he wants to handle the problem, and has a plan, it can be useful\nto develop coping thoughts that help him focus on the task and manage any negative feelings. Highly\ncritical thoughts about ourselves or others not only make us feel bad, but also distract us from the\npresent moment, making it harder to handle a stressful situation. In a coping thought model, you and\nyour client actively develop thoughts that help your client execute his plan and manage his negative\nemotions. Coping thoughts tend to be short and provide directions as to what to do in a specific\nsituation.\nHere is the general process that I use to develop coping thoughts:\n1. Identify the behavior your client wants to accomplish and his plan.\n2. Check if your client\u2019s current thoughts are interfering with or sabotaging his plan.\n3. Develop coping thoughts.\n4. Use imagery to practice your client\u2019s coping thoughts.\n[Page 199]\n188 CBT Made Simple\nIDENTIFY THE BEHAVIOR YOUR CLIENT WANTS TO ACCOMPLISH\nIn addition to being part of a problem-solving plan, coping thoughts can be used for any specific\nbehavior your client wants to accomplish. For example, I have used coping thoughts to help my client\nElyse stop procrastinating, sit down, and complete her tax return; I have also used coping thoughts to\nhelp clients drink only one glass of wine a night, start an exercise program, use relaxation for pain\ncontrol, and raise an awkward topic with a friend or family member. You can also use coping thoughts\nto help clients manage their feelings of anxiety or of being overwhelmed. You want to be sure the\nbehavior is specific and doable. If Elyse does not know how to complete her tax return, all the coping\nstatements in the world will not help her.\nIDENTIFY CURRENT THOUGHTS THAT ARE INTERFERING\nWITH THE PLAN\nSometimes when clients think of a solution to their problem, they are optimistic; however, often\nnegative, sabotaging thoughts interfere with their ability to implement their plan. I usually ask my\nclient what might interfere with his plan, and specifically whether there is anything he is likely to say\nto himself that would sabotage the plan. I want to make sure my client understands the impact of his\nthoughts on his ability to complete his plan. Let\u2019s see if Suzanne has any thoughts that will sabotage\nher plans for how to handle the barbecue.\nTherapist: Suzanne, I am wondering, when you think of helping with the food at the barbecue, or\nstarting to talk to one of the other teachers, what thoughts go through your mind?\nSuzanne: Helping with the food at the barbecue is easy, a really great idea. When I think of going up\nto the other teacher and starting a conversation, I get pretty anxious.\nSuzanne has identified a feeling, but we are looking for sabotaging thoughts. We know from our four-factor\nmodel that thoughts lead to feelings.\nTherapist: What are some of your thoughts that go with your anxious feeling?\nSuzanne: I guess I think that no one will find my questions interesting, and that it was probably a\nmistake to go to the party.\nSuzanne\u2019s therapist wants her to see how these thoughts might sabotage her plan.\nTherapist: When you have these thoughts, how does it affect your plan to start talking to the other\nteachers?\nSuzanne: It makes it really hard and makes me not want to go or just stand there quietly, instead of\ntrying to talk.\nI sometimes draw a diagram to help my client see how his thoughts are sabotaging his plan. Many\nclients find it helpful to visualize the process. This can be especially helpful if a client wants to accomplish his plan but then doesn\u2019t carry out the plan and doesn\u2019t understand what got in the way. Figure\n9.1 shows what Raoul\u2019s therapist drew for Raoul to help him understand the impact of his thoughts on\nhis procrastinating around writing a report.\n[Page 200]\nProblem Solving\u2014Finding a Better Way 189\nThoughts\nThoughts\nSituation This is so\nhard, I will Feelings Behavior I will never\nSits at desk\nnot do a Do other finish the\nto work on Anxious\ngood job, no work, leave project, I am\nproject\none respects desk a failure.\nme anymore.\nFigure 9.1. Raoul avoids a project.\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 9.2: Suzanne Goes to the School Fair\nPractice using a diagram to explain the consequences of your client\u2019s thoughts.\nOnce you have identified your client\u2019s negative sabotaging thoughts, you use a coping thought\nmodel to ask him to put aside these thoughts. Unfortunately, if you tell your client to stop a thought, it\njust bounces back stronger. However, your client can learn to ignore his interfering thoughts, especially\nif he has developed coping thoughts. You can\u2019t think of coping thoughts and interfering thoughts at the\nsame time.\nHELP YOUR CLIENT DEVELOP COPING THOUGHTS\nThe next step is to develop thoughts that help your client cope with the situation and manage his\ndisruptive feelings. Below are questions to help your client develop coping thoughts. You can download\na Questions to Develop Coping Thoughts handout at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\n\u2022 What could you say to yourself that would help you cope with this situation?\n\u2022 What advice could you give a friend in terms of helpful coping thoughts?\n\u2022 What would someone who knows you well suggest as helpful coping thoughts?\n\u2022 If you were in a more optimistic mood, what might you think?\n\u2022 When you have coped successfully in the past, either with a similar or a different type of situation, what have you told yourself?\nOnce you have a list of coping thoughts, write them down. Coping thoughts generally fall into\nthree categories: placing the situation in a realistic perspective, focusing on the task at hand, and managing anxious or overwhelming feelings. Different types of thoughts will be helpful in different situations. Let\u2019s look at some examples of thoughts in each category. You can download a copy of Examples\nof Coping Thoughts at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\n[Page 201]\n190 CBT Made Simple\nExamples of Coping Thoughts\nPlace the Situation in a Focus on the Task Manage Anxiety\nRealistic Perspective\n\u2022 Try not to take this too \u2022 You have a plan. \u2022 Anxiety is not dangerous.\nseriously.\n\u2022 Do the first step of your \u2022 It doesn\u2019t matter if my heart\n\u2022 This is just one situation. plan. is pounding.\n\u2022 If this situation doesn\u2019t work \u2022 Focus on the task. \u2022 I can take some deep\nout, there will be others. breaths.\n\u2022 It does not have to be\n\u2022 Don\u2019t blow this up out of perfect. \u2022 It will pass.\nproportion.\n\u2022 One step at a time \u2022 Anxiety is normal.\n\u2022 Even if I\u2019m upset, I can do \u2022 Remember your rational\nmy plan. thoughts.\n\u2022 You don\u2019t have to listen to\nworry thoughts.\nSuzanne, together with her therapist, identified a number of thoughts she could use as coping\nthoughts to help her start talking to one of the other teachers. They included Stick to your plan, Just ask\na question, There are only three other teachers, and Don\u2019t listen to anxiety.\nUse imagery to practice. Once your client has developed coping thoughts, you take him through his\nplan again in his imagination, this time adding coping thoughts. After we have practiced once, I ask if\nthere is anything he would like to change and if any of the coping thoughts were particularly helpful or\nnot that helpful. I make any changes and then we practice two more times in his imagination.\nWhen Suzanne rehearsed her plan and coping thoughts in her imagination, she particularly liked\nthe thoughts Just ask a question and Don\u2019t listen to anxiety.\nYOUR TURN!\nHelp Raoul Develop Coping Thoughts\nRaoul decided that he wanted to call one of his colleagues whom he had been avoiding and suggest that\nthey have lunch together. He was fairly anxious about calling, and rated his anxiety at a 6 out of 10. His\nthoughts were I haven\u2019t had lunch with him in a long time; he will think it weird that I phone him. How could\nyou help Raoul develop coping thoughts that would help him call his colleague?\nLook at the three possible responses below and pick the one that will help Raoul develop coping\nthoughts.\n1. How could you contact your colleague to ask him out for lunch?\n[Page 202]\nProblem Solving\u2014Finding a Better Way 191\n2. I think it is important that you tell yourself to stop thinking these thoughts; they are clearly\nstopping you from calling your colleague.\n3. I am wondering if you could try to put these thoughts aside and see if we could come up with\nsome thoughts that will help you call your colleague.\nResponse #3 is the next step in developing coping thoughts. Response #1 will help Raoul develop a\nspecific plan of what he will do, but it will not help develop coping thoughts. In response #2, the therapist is telling Raoul to try to stop his thoughts. This will backfire\u2014when we try to stop thinking a\nthought, we just think about it more.\nTherapist: I am wondering if you could try to put these thoughts aside and see if we could\ncome up with some thoughts that will help you call your colleague.\nRaoul: What do you mean?\nLook at the three possible responses below and pick the one that will help Raoul develop coping\nthoughts.\n1. If a friend were anxious about inviting a colleague for lunch, what would you suggest that he\ntell himself?\n2. Your problem is that you are not positive enough.\n3. Just say to yourself\u2014be positive!\nResponse #1 is the best answer. It uses the question \u201cWhat advice could you give a friend in terms of\nhelpful coping thoughts?\u201d and applies it to Raoul\u2019s situation. In responses #2 and #3, the therapist is\ntrying to use positive thinking. The problem is that positive thinking doesn\u2019t work because it is too\ngeneral and doesn\u2019t address the specific behavior the client wants to do.\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 9.3: Develop Coping Thoughts\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 9.4: Use Imagery to Practice\nHomework: Practice CBT\nBefore continuing with the next chapter, take some time to try the homework.\n[Page 203]\n192 CBT Made Simple\nApply What You Learned to a Clinical Example\nComplete the following exercises.\n\uf09d\nExercise 9.1: Nasir Has a Busy Clinic\nExercise 9.2: Suzanne Goes to the School Fair\nApply What You Learned to Your Own Life\nFor the following homework assignment, you can use the guided audio file to help you go through\neach step; I think it is more effective than reading the exercise.\nHomework Assignment #1\n\uf0b2\nPractice Using the Problem-Solving Steps\nAccompanying audio file: Solve Your Own Problems\nThink of a problem that is currently troubling you.

Did you notice your clients\u2019 problem orientation? Did\nyou have a chance to try problem solving in your own life or with any clients? What was it like to consciously evaluate different solutions? Was it hard not to jump in and solve your clients\u2019 problems?\nSet the Agenda\nIn this chapter you will learn how to help your clients who have depression by increasing their activity\nlevel to improve their mood. The technical term for this intervention is behavioral activation.\nAgenda Item #1: How does behavioral activation work?\nAgenda Item #2: Help your clients understand their depression.\nAgenda Item #3: Monitor your clients\u2019 daily activities.\nAgenda Item #4: Plan activities that increase positive moods.\nAgenda Item #5: Graded task assignments.\nAgenda Item #6: Increase well-being.\nWork the Agenda\nBehavioral activation is primarily a treatment for depression. It is based on the premise that when your\nclients change their behaviors, and increase activities that promote pleasure and a sense of competence, their mood will improve.\n[Page 208]\nBehavioral Activation\u2014Action Plans for Depression 197\nAgenda Item #1: How Does Behavioral Activation Work?\nYou can think of depression as a cycle that is caused and maintained by avoidance and a lack of\npositive reinforcement. Depression starts with changes in a client\u2019s life that lead to a decrease in events\nthat she enjoys and an increase in unpleasant events. As a result of these changes, your client\u2019s overall\nmood declines and activities she used to enjoy are less pleasurable. Clients start avoiding activities such\nas seeing friends and family and pursuing hobbies, exercise, or leisure activities. The more clients avoid\nactivities that might lift their mood, the less contact they have with positive reinforcements. The less\ncontact with positive reinforcements, the more down they feel and the less they feel like doing anything\n(Martell, Dimidjian, & Herman-Dunn, 2010).\nWhen clients become less active, their overall routine is disrupted, which may lead to sleep problems, poor appetite, and generally feeling out of sync with their environment, all of which exacerbate\ndepression (Dimidjian, Barrera, Martell, Mu\u00f1oz, & Lewinsohn, 2011). The more your clients are caught\nin this cycle of depression, the more they disengage from their normal life and the more likely they are\nto develop secondary problems. For example, the student who is too depressed to attend baseball practice may eventually be kicked off the team. Figure 10.1 shows how the cycle of depression works.\nTrigger: Difficult Situation or Life Changes\nSecondary Decrease in\nproblems; positive events;\nDisrupted Increase in\nroutines negative events\nAvoid Low mood\nactivities and fatigue\nThoughts: I\ndon\u2019t enjoy\nanything; I\nam tired and\nneed to rest.\nFigure 10.1. Cycle of depression.\n[Page 209]\n198 CBT Made Simple\nBREAKING THE CYCLE OF INACTIVITY AND DEPRESSION\nBehavioral activation interrupts the cycle of depression by directly targeting avoidance and encouraging clients to engage in mood-boosting activities. Clients identify activities that (1) are enjoyable, (2)\nincrease their confidence or sense of mastery, or (3) are functional in that they decrease the negative\nconsequences of avoidance. The therapist works with clients to schedule these activities into their week\nin a step-by-step manner and uses the problem-solving process to address any obstacles (Martell et al.,\n2010). As clients start to engage in pleasurable activities, their mood improves. As clients feel better,\nthey have more energy, they stop wanting to avoid activities, and they engage in healthy routines. In\nshort, a mood-boosting cycle starts.\nBehavioral Activation Theory\nPleasurable Activities + Problem Solving = Behavioral Antidepressant\nOVERVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION\nThe formal goal of behavioral activation is for your clients to return to their pre-depression level of\nfunctioning. I prefer to tell my clients that our goal is to help them have a life they enjoy. The focus is\nto actively encourage clients to engage in activities even though they \u201cfeel\u201d like avoiding or resting. It\nseems to me that folk wisdom often captures the essence of behavioral activation. My Aunt Tanya, who\nis eighty-eight, always told me, \u201cNo matter what, get up every morning and put on your makeup, and\nbefore you go to bed at night, have a sip of vodka.\u201d In other words, according to Aunt Tanya, no matter\nhow you are feeling, get up and face the world, and before the day ends, do something nice for\nyourself.\nGenerally, the behavioral activation process unfolds in the following order.\n1. Understand your client\u2019s depression in relation to changes in his or her daily activities.\n2. Monitor your client\u2019s daily activities.\n3. Plan activities that increase positive mood.\n4. Monitor your client\u2019s mood before and after activities.\n5. Problem solve obstacles.\n6. Establish healthy routines and prevent setbacks.\nIS BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION EFFECTIVE?\nEven though I have practiced behavioral activation for many years, when a client with severe\ndepression comes into my office, I often find myself thinking that behavioral activation will not be\nenough. How can adding pleasurable activities be sufficient to help this very depressed client? But\nrather than believing my automatic thoughts\u2026I look at the evidence!\n[Page 210]\nBehavioral Activation\u2014Action Plans for Depression 199\nOver the past three decades, numerous studies, including a number of meta-analyses, have consistently demonstrated that behavioral activation is an effective treatment for mild, moderate, and severe\ndepression (Dimidjian et al., 2011; Soucy-Chartier & Provencher, 2013). This is true for children, teens,\nand adults of all ages. Behavioral activation alone has been found to be as effective as treatments that\ninclude both behavioral and cognitive interventions, such as identifying and challenging negative\nthoughts (Dimidjian et al., 2006; Richards et al., 2016). There is some indication that if clients are\nseverely depressed, therapy provided over a sixteen-week period that includes only behavioral activation is more effective than therapy that includes behavioral and cognitive interventions. Behavioral\nactivation is also an effective intervention for relapse prevention (Dobson et al., 2008). A recent study\nfound that clients with complicated bereavement also responded positively to behavioral activation\n(Hershenberg, Paulson, Gros, & Acierno, 2014).\nResearch Summary\nClients with mild and moderate depression: Behavioral activation should be a component\nof treatment.\nClients with severe depression: Behavioral activation should be the first intervention.\nAgenda Item #2: Help Your Clients Understand\nTheir Depression\nA client who is depressed often starts therapy saying, \u201cWhat is wrong with me? I used to be so\nstrong\u201d or, \u201cI think I am going crazy, I just feel like crying all day.\u201d You want to help your client understand that her depression is related to a lack of mood-enhancing activities and is not a personal failure.\nYou can use the cycle of depression as a model for gathering information that will help your clients\nunderstand the factors that caused and maintain their depression. If your clients understand that their\ndepression is related to a lack of pleasurable activities in their lives, they will be more motivated to\nengage in mood-boosting activities. This is important, as you are going to ask your clients to engage in\nactivities even if they don\u2019t \u201cfeel like it.\u201d\nStart with looking at the changes in your client\u2019s life that preceded her depression, in particular,\ndecreases in reinforcing and/or pleasurable activities and increases in unpleasant activities. You also\nwant to look at how your client coped with these changes, and the role of avoidance. The two main\nquestions I ask my client are:\n1. What life changes occurred prior to your depression?\n2. How did these changes affect your daily life activities in relation to an increase or decrease in\npleasurable activities?\n[Page 211]\n200 CBT Made Simple\nSUZANNE\u2019S CYCLE OF DEPRESSION\nSuzanne started therapy saying she didn\u2019t know what was wrong with her. She had a great house,\ngreat kids, a good job, and a great husband, but she was just so overwhelmed that she didn\u2019t enjoy life\nanymore. She cried softly as she told her therapist that she wasn\u2019t coping.\nIn chapter 2 we listed the stressors and recent changes in Suzanne\u2019s life that happened prior to her\ndepression.\n1. Suzanne started teaching at a new school. The school is a thirty- to forty-minute commute\nfrom home; she does not know the other teachers, who form a tight group.\n2. Her mother-in-law is no longer able to babysit.\n3. Genia, her best friend, moved away.\nLet\u2019s see how her therapist uses the two questions we just identified to understand Suzanne\u2019s\ndepression.\nTherapist: It sounds like there have been a lot of changes in your life. I am wondering if we could\nspend a moment and think about how each change has affected your life. Which one\nshould we look at first?\nSuzanne: Well, I think the really big one is the new school.\nTherapist: I think it would be helpful to look at how your life has changed since starting at the new\nschool. I want to look at activities you stopped doing, and activities you started doing\nbecause of the new school.\nThe therapist instills hope by starting with, \u201cI think it would be helpful.\u201d Notice her therapist did not ask\nSuzanne how she feels about the new school. She asked her to look at how her life is different.\nSuzanne: One of the biggest changes is the morning. I used to walk to school; it was about fifteen\nminutes each way. I now spend forty-five minutes commuting. The extra thirty minutes I\nused to have meant that I had time to get the kids ready in the morning. Now everything\nhas to be ready the night before. The kids have to be completely ready to be dropped off at\nmy neighbor\u2019s home by 7:30. It\u2019s really hard getting them up, dressed, and fed. My neighbor\ntakes them to school. My husband leaves early for work and can\u2019t help.\nTherapist: That sounds like a really big change to your morning routine.\nSuzanne: Yes, I used to enjoy the mornings\u2014it was a nice time with the kids, and I liked the walk\nto school. Now it is just so stressful.\nThe therapist makes a supportive comment, and Suzanne goes on to elaborate how her life has changed.\nTherapist: I want to start making a list of the ways your life has changed. I think it will help us understand your depression and how to help you. What would you put down?\nNotice how her therapist instills hope. The therapist asks Suzanne what she would put on the list.\n[Page 212]\nBehavioral Activation\u2014Action Plans for Depression 201\nSuzanne: Well, I guess, I no longer have the fifteen-minute walk to school, I no longer have a nice\ntime with my kids in the morning, and actually, I rarely eat breakfast, I am so frazzled. I am\noften starving by the time I get to school.\nTherapist: I think that\u2019s a really good list of all the things that you are no longer doing. What about\nanything that you now do because of the new school that you were not doing before?\nSuzanne: Well, I guess I have to be really organized the night before, which I find hard. I make my\ndaughter\u2019s lunch, put out the kids\u2019 clothes, and make sure I am all organized for school.\nAlso, I have to be really strict with the kids, as I am on a tight schedule. Which means I\nyell more to get them going in the morning. I also have the long drive to work, which I\nhate. I spend the whole time in the car thinking about what a bad mom I\u2019ve become, how\nI yelled at the kids once again, and how I wish I were back at my old school. It\u2019s just awful.\nTherapist: Sounds like a lot of changes. When we look at how different your morning is now to how\nit used to be, what are your thoughts?\nNote that the therapist first asked Suzanne what had changed, second asked her how the change had\naffected her daily life, and third asked her what she thought when she looked at the changes.\nSuzanne: Well, no wonder I am depressed; it sounds like an awful way to start the morning.\nBy examining how her morning has changed, Suzanne has shifted from \u201csomething is wrong with me that\nI am depressed,\u201d to realizing that the changes in her morning routine may be contributing to her\ndepression.\nTherapist: I think you said something important. Seems like the change in school caused a lot of\nother changes in your life and had a negative effect on your morning routine and mood. I\nthink we are discovering some important information. I want to see if there are other ways\nthat starting at the new school has impacted your life.\nNotice how Suzanne\u2019s therapist reinforces her awareness that her morning routine is impacting her mood.\nAlso notice how the therapist keeps Suzanne on track with the task.\nSuzanne used to spend time with other teachers, who were her friends, and now she sees few of her\nfriends. She had enjoyed being involved in the school play and had received a lot of positive feedback\nfrom many people in the school. She was well known as a popular teacher. At her new school she participates in no extracurricular activities and knows none of the other teachers socially. She gets home\nlate from work, tired and frazzled from the drive.\nSuzanne had not realized that since her mother-in-law had become ill and could no longer babysit,\nshe and her husband had practically stopped going out in the evening. It had been ages since they had\nseen many of their friends. Suzanne also realized that since Genia had moved away, she had stopped\nher weekly walks and talked to her friend much less. Suzanne was surprised when she looked at the\nimpact of all the changes in her life.\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 10.1: Raoul\u2019s Cycle of Depression\nPractice using the cycle of depression to understand your clients.\n[Page 213]\n202 CBT Made Simple\nUSE A WRITTEN SUMMARY\nAfter I have explored with my client how her life has changed, I find it helpful to provide a written\nsummary. Sometimes I draw the cycle of depression and together we look at how it is related to my client\u2019s specific situation. Other times I use the Understand Your Depression worksheet, which you can\ndownload at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501. The worksheet gives your client an overview of how\nher activities have changed since she became depressed. When Suzanne looked at her Understand Your\nDepression worksheet, it made sense that the changes in her activities were affecting her depression.\nUnderstand Your Depression\n1. Changes or stressors in your life prior to your depression? New school, mother-in-law no\nlonger babysitting, and Genia, her best friend, moving away.\n2. Since these changes or stressors, how have your activities changed?

This analogy was\ninspired by Melanie Fennell\u2019s virtuous and vicious flowers (Fennell, 2006). I explain that feeling happy\nis similar to a brightly colored flower with lots of petals. I then draw a flower with a circle in the middle\nand petals around the circle. I ask my client to fill in each petal with an activity she did before she\nbecame depressed that she enjoyed or gave meaning to her life. I look for healthy routines; social activities with colleagues, friends, and family; activities that are pleasurable or meaningful; and activities\nthat lead to a sense of competence or mastery.\nOnce my client has completed filling in her flower, I ask her to draw an X through all the petals\nthat have changed since the depression. Usually, almost all of them are gone. What was once a full\nbloom is often only a few petals.\nWith some clients, instead of a flower I draw a picture of a wall. I use bricks to build a strong wall;\nif you take out too many bricks, the wall will fall, or have big holes.\nSuzanne\u2019s therapist used the flower analogy, and Suzanne was surprised to see her flower. Her\ndepression was making more and more sense to her. Her therapist explained that together they would\nhelp Suzanne start to add petals back into her life so that she could start to feel better. Suzanne said\nthis was a good idea, but added that she couldn\u2019t imagine where to begin. Her therapist assured her they\nwould work together and go slowly.\nYour Turn!\nUnderstand Mayleen\u2019s Depression\nBelow is a description of Mayleen, a fifty-eight-year-old woman who has come to therapy because she is\ncurrently depressed. Try to complete the Understand Your Depression worksheet with the information\nbelow. You can see my answers in the appendix.\nMayleen is a successful sculptor. She lives alone, has never married, and has no children. Two\nyears ago her mother became ill, and Mayleen has been very involved in her care.\nMayleen\u2019s mother lives alone in the town where Mayleen grew up, about three hours away.\nMayleen left when she was eighteen and no longer has any friends or other family who live\nthere. She spends four days a week visiting her mother and attending to her needs, looking after\nthe house, and taking her to doctor\u2019s appointments. Mayleen is happy that she is able to care for\nher sick mother but feels lonely when she visits. She and her mother watch a lot of daytime TV,\nwhich Mayleen finds boring.\nOver the two years that her mother has been ill, Mayleen has become increasingly depressed\nand feels guilty about not spending all her time caring for her mother. She has stopped seeing\nmany of her friends, has given up exercise, and has almost completely stopped sculpting, as she\nbelieves there is no time for these activities, and she is so tired most of the time.\n[Page 215]\n204 CBT Made Simple\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 10.1: Explain Depression\nAgenda Item #3: Monitor Your Clients\u2019 Daily Activities\nBehavioral activation involves asking your clients to engage in pleasurable activities. Sounds easy.\nThe difficulty is that depressed clients don\u2019t feel like doing anything. They will tell you, \u201cNothing\nhelps.\u201d You are going to ask your clients to act according to a plan rather than according to how they\nfeel. If your clients can see the connection between an increase in their activity level and an increase\nin their mood, they will be more motivated to add pleasurable activities to their lives, even if they don\u2019t\n\u201cfeel\u201d like doing them.\nThe easiest way for clients to see the connection between their mood and specific activities is to\nmonitor their daily activities and rate their moods. I ask clients to complete a Daily Activities Schedule\n(available at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501), where they write what they do, hour by hour, and\nrate their mood. I usually complete the first day of the Daily Activities Schedule during the therapy\nhour. That way, I am sure my clients understand what to do. (If the session is early in the morning, we\ncomplete it for the previous day.) Then for homework I assign the Daily Activities Schedule for the rest\nof the week.\nHere is how I introduce the Daily Activities Schedule. I explain both the rationale behind the\nintervention and what we will be doing.\nI think it is important to understand how you spend your days, and if your mood changes with\nthe types of activities that you do. I have a Daily Activities Schedule where you can write down\nwhat you do throughout the day, and rate your mood. That way, we can see whether there are\ntimes during the day when you feel better, and times when you feel worse. We are going to try\nand increase the times you feel better and learn how to cope with the times when you feel\nworse. Does this make sense to you?\nLet\u2019s take today and see if we can complete the schedule together. Is that okay with you?\nWhat time did you wake up? If you had to rate your mood from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most\ndepressed you have ever been, and 1 being not at all depressed, where would you rate your\nmood when you woke up today?\nI then take my client through her day, rating her mood during each activity.\nYour Turn!\n\uf0b2\nPractice in Your Imagination:\nExplain a Daily Activities Schedule\nBefore you start, rate from 1 to 10 how comfortable you are explaining a Daily Activities Schedule to a\nclient who is depressed. At the end of the exercise, rate your level of comfort again to see whether it\nchanged. Now, let\u2019s try this exercise.\n[Page 216]\nBehavioral Activation\u2014Action Plans for Depression 205\nChoose a client who is depressed and who you think would benefit from using behavioral activation. Try to get a picture of him or her in your mind. Imagine yourself in your office with your client.\nSee your office; notice the sounds and smells in the room. Imagine that you want to introduce a Daily\nActivities Schedule. Read over how I explain using a Daily Activities Schedule while imagining yourself saying the words. You can also use your own phrases. Imagine getting out the Daily Activities\nSchedule and explaining it to your client. Now, imagine explaining the Daily Activities Schedule two\nmore times with the same client. Each time, imagine that your client responds positively.\nWHAT DID YOUR CLIENT LEARN?\nThe next step is to use the Daily Activities Schedule to help your client discover an activity/mood\nrelationship and to decide which times of day to target and which activities to introduce or expand. I\nstart with asking my client about the general experience of completing the Daily Activities Schedule\nand then ask whether she learned anything in the process. I then go over Questions to Explore a Mood/\nActivity Relationship (Martell et al., 2010). When I first started doing behavioral activation, I kept\nthese questions next to me. You can download a copy at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\n\u2022 Do you see an activity/mood relationship?\n\u2022 What activities help you feel better?\n\u2022 What activities or situations are connected to a low mood?\n\u2022 What time periods are you most at risk for a low mood?\n\u2022 Do you have any routines that help you maintain a positive mood?\n\u2022 Is there anything you are avoiding?\nBelow is the Daily Activities Schedule that Suzanne completed and brought to therapy. She rated\nher depression from 1 to 10, 1 being not at all depressed and 10 being the most depressed she had ever\nbeen.\n[Page 217]\n206 CBT Made Simple\neludehcS\nseitivitcA\nyliaD\ns\u2019ennazuS\n)desserped\nyrev\n= ;desserped\nlla\nta\nton\n=\n1(\nyadnuS\nyadrutaS\nyadirF\nyadsruhT\nyadsendeW\nyadseuT\nyadnoM\n)7(\nsdik\nekaW\n)6(\nsdik\nekaW\n)8(\nsdik\nekaW\n)8(\nsdik\nekaW\n00:6\nsdik\nffo\nporD\nsdik\nffo\nporD\nsdik\nffo\nporD\nsdik\nffo\nporD\n00:7\n)7(\n)9(\n)9(\n)8(\n)9(\ndeb\nni\neiL\n)9(\ndeb\nni\neiL\nkrow\not\nevirD\nkrow\not\nevirD\nkrow\not\nevirD\nkrow\not\nevirD\n00:8\n)7(\n)7(\n)9(\n)9(\nenohP\n;esuoh\nnaelC\n)5(\nhcaeT\n)5(\nhcaeT\nta\nyad\nstropS\n)5(\nhcaeT\n)6(\nhcaeT\n00:9\n)3(\ndneirf\n)4(\nsdnarre\n)4(\nloohcs\nhtiw\nyalP\n)4(\nsdik\n00:01\n-ni-rehtom\ntisiV\n00:11\n)4(\nwal\n)5(\nhcnuL\n)5(\nhcnuL\ndna\nsseceR\ndna\nsseceR\ndoof\nhtiw\npleH\ndna\nsseceR\ndna\nsseceR\n00:21\n)7(\nhcnul\n)7(\nhcnul\n)4(\n)8(\nhcnul\n)8(\nhcnul\n)5(\nhcaeT\n)5(\nhcaeT\n)4(\nyad\nstropS\n)5(\nhcaeT\n)5(\nhcaeT\n00:1\not\nsdik\nekaT\n00:2\n)4(\nkrap\n[Page 218]\nBehavioral Activation\u2014Action Plans for Depression 207\nhtiw\nkraP\n)6(\nemoh\nevirD\not\ngniteeM\nhtiw\npu\nnaelC\n)9(\nemoh\nevirD\not\ngniteeM\n00:3\n)4(\ndneirf\nretniw\nssucsid\nsrehcaet\nrehto\nretniw\nssucsid\nyadiloh\n)4(\nyadiloh\n)4(\nylbmessa\n)4(\nylbmessa\n,sdik\npu\nkciP\n)6(\nemoh\nevirD\n)6(\nemoh\nevirD\n,sdik\npu\nkciP\n)7(\nemoh\nevirD\n00:4\n)6(\nVT\nhctaw\n)6(\nVT\nhctaw\nemac\nstneraP\nesuoh\nsdneirF\n;sdik\npu\nkciP\n;sdik\npu\nkciP\n;sdik\npu\nkciP\n;sdik\npu\nkciP\n;sdik\npu\nkciP\n00:5\nrennid\nazzip\nrof\nhtiw\nrennid\nrof\nrennid\nekam\nrennid\nekam\nrennid\nekam\nrennid\nekam\nrennid\nekam\n)4(\n)4(\nsdik\n)7(\n)6(\n)7(\n)6(\n)7(\nta\nrenniD\nenola\nrenniD\nhtiw\nrenniD\nenola\nrenniD\nhtiw\nrenniD\n00:6\nesuoh\ns\u2019dneirf\n)7(\nsdik\nhtiw\ndna\nsdik\n)7(\nsdik\nhtiw\ndna\nsdik\n)4(\n)4(\ndnabsuh\n)5(\ndnabsuh\ndeb\not\nsdik\ntuP\ndeb\not\nsdik\ntuP\nstup\ndnabsuH\ndeb\not\nsdik\ntuP\n00:7\n)7(\ndnabsuh\nhtiw\n)4(\ndeb\not\nsdik\n)7(\n)5(\ndeb\not\nsdik\ntuP\ndeb\not\nsdik\ntuP\ndeb\not\nsdik\ntuP\nhtiw\ntahC\nhtiw\nemag\nyalP\nhtiw\nVT\naineG\nenohP\n00:8\n)5(\ndnabsuh\nhtiw\ndnabsuh\nhtiw\n)4(\nrobhgien\n)4(\ndnabsuh\n)4(\ndnabsuh\n)4(\n)4(\n)4(\nrof\nydaer\nteG\nsemag\ndna\nVT\nhtiw\nVT\nhctaW\nrof\nydaer\nteG\nrof\nydaer\nteG\nrof\nydaer\nteG\nrof\nydaer\nteG\n00:9\n)7(\nyadnoM\ndnabsuh\nhtiw\ndnabsuh\n)7(\nyad\ntxen\n)5(\nyad\ntxen\n)6(\nyad\ntxen\n)8(\nyad\ntxen\n)4(\n)3(\ndeB\ndeB\ndeB\ndeB\ndeB\ndeB\ndeB\n00:01\n[Page 219]\n208 CBT Made Simple\nWHAT DID SUZANNE LEARN?\nBefore looking at Suzanne\u2019s answers to Questions to Explore a Mood/Activity Relationship,\nexamine her week and see how you would answer the following questions. After each question, I have\nincluded Treatment Implications, where I encourage you to think about how you would use the answers\nto the questions in guiding future therapy.\nDo you see an activity/mood relationship? What activities help you feel better? What activities or\nsituations are connected to a low mood? When Suzanne reviewed her Daily Activities Schedule, it\nstruck her that she was doing almost nothing fun. She was surprised that when she was more active,\nher mood improved. In particular, socializing with other people helped her feel better. Suzanne also\nnoted that she felt better when her husband was home and that she felt fairly good most of the time at\nschool. Suzanne had always thought that she felt better on the weekends because she slept more and\nwas away from school. After looking at her Daily Activities Schedule, she wondered if she felt better\nbecause she was more active and spending time with her husband, friends, and family.\nSuzanne noted she was very depressed during her drives to and from school. She explained that she\nspent most of the drive thinking about how horrible the morning had been and how she wished she was\nback at her old school. Watching TV at night with her kids and without her husband was also a low\ntime. She also noted how much she disliked getting ready for the next day and how hard she found the\nmorning routines.\nTreatment implications: How would you use Suzanne\u2019s answers to the questions above to reinforce\nthe importance of adding pleasurable activities to her life?\nWhat time periods are you most at risk for low mood? Suzanne noted that mornings were particularly bad. When she wakes up, she lies in bed and thinks about what a bad mother she is and how her\nhusband must be fed up with her. She has images of him leaving her and of being alone and miserable.\nSuzanne had not realized how depressed she was every morning and how hard it was for her to get the\nkids ready on a tight time schedule. She also noted that the nights she was home alone with the kids\nwere particularly hard, and she was often depressed.\nTreatment implications: What time period would you target first for adding pleasurable activities?\nDo you have any routines that help you maintain a positive mood? Suzanne could not see any routines that helped her feel better. She realized how different that was from the previous year, when she\nhad a good morning routine, walked to school, and regularly saw friends. Her therapist noticed that she\nput her children to bed at a regular and appropriate time. Suzanne and her husband also went to bed\nat a regular time and early enough that they got eight hours of sleep. Her therapist thought that these\nwere real strengths and important routines.\nTreatment implications: How would you use this information in therapy?\nIs there anything you are avoiding? Suzanne could not think of anything she was avoiding. She mentioned that she did not go out with her friends much anymore, but that was because she was so tired all\nof the time.\nTreatment implications: From a behavioral activation perspective, do you think she is avoiding\nfriends?\n[Page 220]\nBehavioral Activation\u2014Action Plans for Depression 209\nAgenda Item #4: Plan Activities That Increase Positive Moods\nAfter looking at her schedule, Suzanne agreed it would be a good idea to start a mood-boosting\nplan. Her therapist explained that when you are depressed, doing pleasurable activities is like taking\nmedicine\u2014you do it because you know it will help, not because you want to. As a therapist, you need\nto encourage your clients to follow their mood-boosting plan rather than their depressed feelings.\nACTIVITIES THAT ENCOURAGE MASTERY AND PLEASURE\nIn behavioral activation you want to increase activities that provide your client with a sense of\nmastery or competence and pleasure. However, such a general statement does not provide much guidance for therapy. I suggest activities in the following categories to help boost a client\u2019s mood. It is important to remember that this is a very individualized process, as activities that provide a sense of mastery\nor competence and pleasure are different for every individual.\nActivities of daily living. First and foremost, I want to be sure that my client is accomplishing the basic\nbusiness of living, including feeding herself, cleaning her clothes, getting enough sleep, doing basic\nchores, and addressing responsibilities to family, friends, or work such as taking care of children or\ncompleting minimal work tasks. For example, Suzanne is often too frazzled to eat breakfast and arrives\nat school starving. She often eats a chocolate bar or is hungry all morning. It would be important for\nher therapist to help Suzanne make an effort to eat breakfast.\nSocial contact. People vary in how much and what kind of social contact they want, but everyone\nneeds some. When clients become depressed, they usually withdraw from family and friends. It can be\nhard to re-engage. You want to start slowly with small steps.\nExercise. There is increasing evidence that regular exercise boosts your mood and can counter\ndepressed feelings (Trivedi et al., 2011). Exercising outdoors may lift your mood even more than exercising indoors (Barton & Pretty, 2010). This makes total sense to me; I am far happier walking outside on\na beautiful spring day than using the treadmill in the gym. In fact, I am even happier if I walk outside\nwith a good friend\u2026and pick up a coffee (and maybe even a cookie!).\nClients vary tremendously in how much exercise they want to do. Generally, any increase in activity is good. With some clients I have started by encouraging them to go outside for five minutes.\nPleasurable activities. When clients are depressed it can be hard to find activities that they find pleasurable. Here are some suggestions.\n\u2022 Build on existing activities. Identify mood-boosting activities your client is already doing and\nexpand the activity. For example, if your client enjoyed talking to a friend about the recent\npolitical situation, can she see this friend more often? Can she contact another friend? Maybe\nthe stimulation of discussing politics increased her mood. Could she read the newspaper or\nlisten to a podcast?\n\u2022 Try activities your client used to enjoy before she was depressed. She may be surprised at how\nmuch she still enjoys them. Just make sure your client doesn\u2019t expect to enjoy these activities\nas much as before.\n[Page 221]\n210 CBT Made Simple\n\u2022 Use the Pleasurable Activities List, which you can download at http://www.newharbinger.\ncom/38501. The list can start clients thinking about possible activities they don\u2019t usually do but\nmight like to try.\n\u2022 Choose activities that lead to a sense of mastery or competence. People tend to enjoy doing\nthings they are good at. You also want to address any avoidant behavior that is likely to create\nadditional problems, such as avoiding completing a work project or enrolling children in camp.\n\u2022 Encourage activities that are consistent with your client\u2019s values and are meaningful. For\nexample, volunteering may be enjoyable because it is related to a client\u2019s values.\nPractice being mindful. I encourage my clients to gently put aside their critical mind and allow themselves to concentrate on the activity in the moment. For example, if a client is walking outside, I\nencourage her to notice the fresh air, see the flowers, and feel the wind. Don\u2019t tell your client to stop\nthinking negative thoughts. When we tell ourselves to stop thinking something, the thought bounces\nback stronger. Some of my clients like the idea of taking a holiday from their negative thoughts.\nGUIDELINES FOR EFFECTIVE ACTIVITY PLANS\nSuzanne wanted to start with an activity that would have an immediate effect on her mornings, as\nshe arrives at school already very depressed. She decided to try listening to music and podcasts in the\ncar on the way to work as a way to boost her mood.\nSuzanne also wanted to add telephoning Genia, her best friend; contacting Rita, her friend from\nher previous school; and seeing her mother-in-law. She set a time when she would call Rita and Genia.\nRather than set a specific time to see her mother-in-law, Suzanne wanted to see how her weekend\ndeveloped. Sometimes it is helpful to set specific times for activities, but sometimes clients want a more\nflexible schedule. If we were flexible in terms of when an activity would get done, and my client didn\u2019t\ndo the activity, the next week I try to set a specific time. Suzanne was not optimistic that these would\nmake much difference to her mood, but she was willing to try.\nThough these activities sound great, often clients don\u2019t do the activities they plan. Activities that\nfollow the guidelines below have a better chance of being done. You can find a Guidelines for an\nEffective Activity Plan handout at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\n\u2022 Was the plan developed collaboratively with your client?\n\u2022 Is the plan specific and concrete?\n\u2022 Is the plan doable?\n\u2022 Is the plan naturally reinforcing?\n\u2022 Can the plan be part of a regular routine?\nDeveloped collaboratively. I start by asking, \u201cWhat would be a good activity to add to your week that\nwould help you start to feel better?\u201d Clients often have very good suggestions; however, sometimes they\n[Page 222]\nBehavioral Activation\u2014Action Plans for Depression 211\nneed help thinking of good activities. If you suggest the activity, try to involve your client in tailoring\nyour suggestions to her situation. The key is to develop the activity with your client, not for your client.\nSuzanne\u2019s therapist was careful that the activities were either Suzanne\u2019s idea or developed together.\nSpecific and concrete. Use the same criteria we used to decide whether homework was sufficiently\nspecific and concrete: Is there a specific behavior your client is going to do? How often will your client\ndo the activity? Where and when will your client do the activity?\nSuzanne\u2019s activities are specific and concrete. Suzanne wanted some flexibility in planning to see\nher mother-in-law. That seemed fine to her therapist. Not every activity has to be rigidly scheduled.\nDoable. Start at your client\u2019s current level of activity, not where she would like to be, or where she used\nto be. Start small, so that your client can experience success. I always ask if the activity \u201cfeels doable.\u201d\nI also check if my client has everything she needs to complete the activity. Ask if your client foresees\nany obstacles and problem solve how to overcome them.\nWhen Suzanne\u2019s therapist checked if the activities felt doable, Suzanne said that listening to music\nwhile driving to and from school felt doable. However, the idea of finding a podcast, downloading it,\nand then concentrating on someone talking felt overwhelming. They decided she would focus on listening to music.\nNaturally reinforcing. Choose activities that are intrinsically enjoyable or that your client will receive\npositive reinforcement for doing. For example, fifteen minutes of playing a board game with your child\nis more naturally reinforcing than fifteen minutes of doing dishes. This is particularly important in the\nbeginning, when you want your client to experience positive results and stay motivated.\nThe activities Suzanne and her therapist chose were naturally reinforcing. Suzanne likes music and\nenjoys spending time with Rita, Genia, and her mother-in-law.\nRegular routine. Many of my clients initially suggest planning a big, faraway event, such as a vacation\nfor next December. However, positive, routine activities sustain a positive mood more than one-time,\nbig events. Examples of routine activities include a regular date with a friend or a weekly exercise class.\nA good routine is like a good structure that maintains a good mood.\nThe activities Suzanne and her therapist picked could become part of her routine.\nYOUR TURN!\nDevelop Mood-Boosting Activities for Anna\nAnna recently graduated from a community college program and has been living at home with her\nparents for the past six months while she looks for work. She is increasingly depressed. She completed\na Daily Activities Schedule, which she reviewed with her therapist, who wanted to add activities that\nwould increase pleasure or a sense of mastery or competence.\nAnna noticed that her lowest mood is around 5:00 p.m. She is alone in the house, and her parents\ndo not get home for another two hours. She spends the time surfing the web and ruminating. Her\ntherapist tells her to stop ruminating and that surfing the web is not helping her. Anna used to like\nrunning, but she has not run for over a year. Her therapist suggests that Anna go back to running,\n[Page 223]\n212 CBT Made Simple\nstarting with three times a week for an hour. Anna likes the idea. Together they decide that Anna will\nrun Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for an hour at 5:00 p.m.\nNow try the following exercise:\n1. Evaluate her therapist\u2019s interventions in relation to the Guidelines for an Effective Activity\nPlan, and complete the following table. You can see my answers in the appendix.\nSuggested Developed Specific and Doable Naturally Regular\nActivity Collaboratively Concrete Reinforcing Routine\nRun three\ntimes a week\nfor an hour\n2. After you assess the current plan, design a more effective one.\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 10.2: Jamar Is Feeling Depressed\nPractice assessing whether planned activities are likely to be effective.\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 10.2: Plan Mood-Boosting Activities\nMONITOR YOUR CLIENT\u2019S MOOD BEFORE AND AFTER ACTIVITIES\nIf you ask your clients who are depressed if they will enjoy an activity, they will probably say no.\nClients who are depressed don\u2019t enjoy activities as much as they used to. However, clients tend to enjoy\nactivities more than they think they will. Often, starting the activity is the hardest part. Rating moods\nbefore and after a pleasurable activity provides your client with important data on how adding\n[Page 224]\nBehavioral Activation\u2014Action Plans for Depression 213\nmood-boosting activities to her life affects her moods. I usually ask clients to complete the Predict Your\nMood worksheet, shown below. (You can download a blank copy at http://www.newharbinger.\ncom/38501.)\nAfter clients try an activity, if their mood ratings improved, I ask what they learned. I want my\nclients to see that even though they believe that they will not enjoy an activity, their predictions are not\nnecessarily accurate.\nLet\u2019s see how Suzanne completed the Predict Your Mood worksheet for two of the activities she was\ngoing to try and how her therapist used the worksheet.\nPredict Your Mood\nDate and How much will Mood Before How much did Mood After\nActivity I enjoy this Activity I enjoy this Activity\nactivity? activity?\n(rate from 1\u201310; (rate from 1\u201310;\n(rate from 1\u201310; 1 = very happy; (rate from 1\u201310; 1 = very happy;\n1 = not at all; 10 = very 1 = not at all; 10 = very\n10 = a lot) depressed) 10 = a lot) depressed)\nMonday: 3 7 5 5\nListened to music\nin the car\nCalled friend, 3 7 6\u20137 4\nRita\nTherapist: Looks like you did a great job of completing the Predict Your Mood worksheet. When you\nlook at your responses, what do you notice?\nSuzanne: Well, for one thing, in both cases my mood went up.\nTherapist: Could you tell me more about that?\nThe therapist wants to expand and consolidate Suzanne\u2019s awareness of the activity/mood relationship.\nWhen her therapist asks for details, Suzanne remembers the experience and it becomes more salient.\nSuzanne: Well, I actually enjoyed listening to music. I chose some really upbeat old songs that I like.\nI think it distracted me from my bad morning.\nTherapist: So listening to music was a good idea. What about talking to Rita?\nSuzanne: That was also more enjoyable than I expected. We had a really good talk and caught up.\nShe told me she missed me, and all my friends have been asking about me.\n[Page 225]\n214 CBT Made Simple\nHer therapist uses a summary statement to consolidate the experience.\nTherapist: I hear Rita missed you, and your other friends also miss you. Hmm (therapist gently smiles).\nLet\u2019s look at the accuracy of your predictions. What did you initially predict? (They look at\nthe Predict Your Mood worksheet.)\nNotice how Suzanne\u2019s therapist is not giving Suzanne the answers but is asking her for the information and\nletting her draw her own conclusions.\nSuzanne: I predicted that I would not enjoy listening to music and calling Rita very much. I gave\nboth a 3.\nTherapist: And what actually happened?\nSuzanne: (laughing a bit) Well, I actually enjoyed listening to music quite a bit; I gave it a 5. And I\nenjoyed talking to Rita way more than I expected; I gave it a 6 to 7\u2014it was great to catch up.\nTherapist: And what does that say about your predictions?\nSuzanne: I guess I was wrong.\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 10.3: Monitor Mood Before and After Activities\nOVERCOMING ROADBLOCKS: YOUR CLIENT DID NOT TRY THE\nPLANNED ACTIVITY\nDespite your best efforts, your client will not always do the agreed-upon activities. First, ask your\nclient what got in the way. Sometimes it is a simple answer. Next, ask what went though her mind when\nshe thought of doing the activity. Did she think it was too hard? Did she think it would not help, or did\nshe have other thoughts? I go back to the fundamental principle: Follow your mood-boosting plan\nrather than your depressed feelings. Remember, for depression, activity is like medicine. There is some\nevidence that clients who make a public commitment to doing an activity are more likely to follow\nthrough (Locke & Latham, 2002). If my client has supportive family members or friends, I encourage\nher to share her plans.\nI then problem solve how my client could do the activity the next week, or modify the activity so\nthat it is more doable. I make sure I remain encouraging and optimistic and convey my belief that treatment will work.\nThe first week, Suzanne listened to music every day on the way to and from work. However, at her\nnext appointment, she told her therapist that she had stopped listening to music, that this past week\nshe was just \u201ctoo down.\u201d Her therapist reviewed what Suzanne had learned from her Predict Your Mood\nworksheet. She decided to try again. Suzanne laughed and said she would have to listen to music \u201ceven\nwith her depressed hat on.\u201d Her therapist thought this was a great image, and used it often in therapy.\n[Page 226]\nBehavioral Activation\u2014Action Plans for Depression 215\nWHAT IF I HAVE ONLY A FEW SESSIONS?\nThe research on behavioral activation has generally evaluated a protocol that involves sixteen\nweeks of treatment, and often two sessions a week for the first eight weeks (see, for example, Dimidjian\net al., 2006). However, many therapists see clients for only a few sessions. If I have only a couple of sessions, I start with exploring what my client is no longer doing that she used to enjoy. I then explain the\nactivity/mood relationship. Either in the first or second session, we work together to identify specific\npleasurable activities she could start doing. I make sure the activities make sense given my client\u2019s\ncurrent level of activity. I try to target a period of the day when her mood is particularly low. If possible,\nI encourage social contact, as there is such strong evidence that it is a mood booster.\nPREVENTING RELAPSE\nTo maintain a positive mood, your client needs to have good routines. What is involved in a good\nroutine is different for every person, but it generally includes a structure to the day, socializing, some\nexercise, activities that are meaningful and connected to your client\u2019s values, and some fun. I use the\nanalogy of creating a strong structure for a building. If the supporting beams are rotten and weak, even\nif you have good drywall and a beautiful paint color, you will have an unstable house.\nI teach my clients that after therapy ends, if they start to get depressed again or are going through\na stressful time, they should examine their daily routine. I encourage them to notice their worst times\nof the day and think about how they can make those times better. I also encourage them to try adding\neven small mood-boosting activities throughout the day.\nI also use activity scheduling to prevent depression with clients who are going through a particularly difficult time. If you have ever gone through a difficult time, I am sure people have told you to\n\u201ctake care of yourself.\u201d This is good advice, but very general. I examine pleasurable activities my client\nhas stopped doing because of the stress and see if we can add them back into her life, or add other\nactivities that she enjoys. Together we make a specific plan that is doable and can be part of my client\u2019s\nroutine.\nAgenda Item #5: Graded Task Assignments\nGraded task assignments are used primarily when your client is avoiding important tasks that feel\noverwhelming. It is often a component of activity scheduling, problem solving, and treating\nprocrastination.\nGraded task assignments involve looking at a whole activity and breaking it down into smaller\npieces, or chunks. These smaller chunks feel doable in a way that the whole task does not. Your client\nstarts with completing the first chunk and progresses to additional chunks. It can be helpful to limit\n[Page 227]\n216 CBT Made Simple\nthe amount of time a client spends on each task to make it feel more manageable. By breaking tasks\ndown into specific chunks, your client can feel she is progressing as she completes each task. It can also\nbe helpful to set a specific time when the tasks will be done.\nFor graded task assignments to be effective, the tasks have to be very specific and concrete behaviors. For example, if a client is procrastinating over filing his taxes, the first task might be spending\ntwenty minutes reviewing the tax form, the second task might be spending half an hour gathering\nincome statements, and the third task might be entering the income information he gathered on the\ntax form. You don\u2019t need to set out all the steps, but it is helpful to specify the first few.\nYOUR TURN!\nUse Graded Task Assignments\nBelow are examples of clients who are feeling overwhelmed. Their therapists want to use graded task\nassignments as an intervention. Look at their first task and decide if it is sufficiently specific and concrete, doable, and time-limited. I will do the first one; you do the next two. You can find my answers in\nthe appendix.\n1. Cynthia\u2019s boss asked her to be in charge of the site visit when members of the head office come\nto inspect their unit. She is feeling very overwhelmed. She and her therapist thought a good\nfirst task would be reorganizing the filing system to make it more systematic.\n2. Richard wanted to invite his whole family\u2014about fifteen people\u2014for Thanksgiving dinner.\nHe is feeling very overwhelmed. His therapist and he thought that spending thirty minutes\nmaking a list of the food he wanted to cook would be a good first task.\n3. Alexandra wanted to find a part-time job. She is feeling very overwhelmed and tells her therapist she does not know where to start. She and her therapist thought that exploring her options\nfor work would be a good first step.\n[Page 228]\nBehavioral Activation\u2014Action Plans for Depression 217\nTask Specific and Doable?

The focus is on developing interventions that promote well-being rather than on alleviating depression (Seligman, Steen, Park, & Peterson, 2005). Most CBT therapists I know incorporate\nsome of the following interventions into behavioral activation. Though less robust than the research\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of behavioral activation, there is some evidence that these interventions may increase happiness (Duckworth, Steen, & Seligman, 2005; Sin & Lyubomirsky, 2009).\nACTIVITIES THAT INCREASE WELL-BEING\nSocialize with friends and family. Social contact is the single factor most consistently related to happiness (Leung, Kier, Fung, Fung, & Sproule, 2013; Parks, Della Porta, Pierce, Zilca, & Lyubomirsky,\n2012). Increasing positive social interaction is also one of the most effective interventions to increase\nhappiness (Seligman et al., 2005).\nKeep a journal of positive experiences. Write down one to three positive experiences a day. I ask my\nclients to take a moment to remember the experience fully and to see it occurring again in their\nmind\u2019s eye.\nSavor the moment. Make a conscious effort to enjoy a pleasant moment. It is helpful to focus on one\u2019s\nsenses to stay present. For example, if a client plans to take a walk, remind her to notice the flowers or\nthe fresh air.\nExpress gratitude. Write one to three things to be grateful for every day. This is also called \u201ccounting\none\u2019s blessings.\u201d I ask my client to take a moment to remember the blessing fully and to appreciate that\nit was in her life. Another form of expressing gratitude involves consciously telling, or writing to, others\nto say that you appreciate them or what they have done.\nPractice acts of kindness. Consciously do a kind act you would not normally do. This may involve\nconsciously acting in a kind manner to someone you would not normally be kind to, or doing an additional kind act to someone you would normally be kind to. Ask your client to notice the other person\u2019s\nreaction to her acts of kindness. Often people smile, say thank you, or react in a positive manner, which\nin turn will contribute to your client\u2019s feeling happy. It\u2019s nice when someone smiles at you.\nThink optimistically. Identify a potentially stressful upcoming event and then describe the best possible outcome. The more detailed the description, the more emotionally engaged your client, and the\nmore positive her mood. Encourage your client to write the description and to form a detailed image in\nher mind of the positive outcome.\nHomework: Practice CBT\nBefore continuing with the next chapter, take some time to try the homework.\n[Page 230]\nBehavioral Activation\u2014Action Plans for Depression 219\nApply What You Learned to a Clinical Example\nComplete the following exercises.\n\uf09d\nExercise 10.1: Raoul\u2019s Cycle of Depression\nExercise 10.2: Jamar Is Feeling Depressed\nApply What You Learned to Your Own Life\nTherapists often talk about the importance of self-care.

Did you have a chance to ask a client to\nmonitor his or her daily activities? What about adding mood-boosting activities to a client\u2019s life, or your\nown? Did you try graded task assignments to help a client break down an overwhelming task?\nIf you did not have a chance to do the homework, think of a mood-boosting activity you could add\nto your own life this week. Choose a small, doable activity. Schedule it into your week. Then try it, and\nnotice the effect on your mood.\nSet the Agenda\nIn this chapter we are going to learn how to use exposure therapy to help your clients face situations\nthey have been avoiding.\nAgenda Item #1: What is exposure?\nAgenda Item #2: Prepare to do exposure.\nAgenda Item #3: Implement exposure.\nAgenda Item #4: Do postexposure debriefing.\nAgenda Item #5: Discuss relapse prevention.\nWork the Agenda\nAs with all interventions, to use exposure effectively, it\u2019s critical to begin with a clear understanding of\nhow and why it works.\n[Page 234]\nExposure Therapy\u2014Clients Face Their Fears 223\nAgenda Item #1: What Is Exposure?\nExposure therapy is a treatment for anxiety based on gradual, planned, repeated exposure to what\nwe fear, starting with easy situations and progressing to more difficult situations. It is based on the\npremise that the more we face our fears, the less anxious we become and the more we learn we can\ncope.\nI want to start by telling you a story related to exposure from my own life. I am at Disneyland. My\nkids want to ride the really big roller coaster. We wait in line. I start to get anxious; the roller coaster\nlooks pretty scary. I wonder, Are there lots of accidents? It occurs to me that if planes can crash, roller\ncoasters can also crash. We get to the front of the line, I look at the roller coaster, and I have one of the\nmost intense anxiety reactions of my entire life. I turn to my husband, with panic in my voice, and say,\n\u201cI am absolutely not going on that thing!\u201d\nIf I do not get on the roller coaster, what will happen to my fear? Next time, will I be more or less\nlikely to go on a roller coaster? How will I feel about my ability to cope with roller coasters? How will I\nfeel about my ability to cope with scary rides generally?\nI am embarrassed to say, I turned around, made my way back through the long line, and did not go\non a roller coaster for many years. If I wanted to get over my fear of roller coasters, what would you\nsuggest? Here is my plan: Start with a really small roller coaster, and ride it a few times until I am comfortable. Next, try a slightly larger roller coaster. Once I am comfortable with this larger roller coaster,\ntry an even bigger one. Basically, my plan for overcoming my roller coaster anxiety is exposure therapy.\nExposure therapy involves identifying the feared object or situation your client is avoiding and\nmaking a plan to face the fear. Your client starts exposure with objects or situations that elicit little fear\nand stays in the situation until either habituation occurs or he learns that he can cope with the situation. Your client then progressively faces situations that elicit more fear.\nExposure Therapy\nOvercome Anxiety = Face Your Fears\nTHE THEORY BEHIND EXPOSURE\nThere are basically two theoretical models that explain exposure: habituation (Foa & Kozak, 1986)\nand exposure as a behavioral experiment (Clark & Beck, 2010; Craske, Treanor, Conway, Zbozinek, &\nVervliet, 2014). My own sense is that both models are accurate and reinforce each other.\nHabituation is based on the observation that when an anxiety-provoking stimulus is consistently\npaired with a neutral consequence, the fear response eventually extinguishes. Let\u2019s look at my roller\ncoaster example. The roller coaster is the anxiety-provoking stimulus. I think about riding a roller\ncoaster and I get anxious. If I frequently ride a roller coaster and consistently nothing bad happens,\nriding the roller coaster becomes paired with a neutral consequence (nothing bad happening). If I ride\noften enough, I will habituate to the roller coaster and no longer be afraid. In our daily lives, exposure\noccurs naturally, all the time. Can you remember a situation where you were initially anxious, but as\nyou got used to the situation, your anxiety diminished or disappeared? Maybe it was your first night in\n[Page 235]\n224 CBT Made Simple\na new house, driving on the highway, or jumping off a diving board? By staying in the situation until\nyou were no longer afraid, you were naturally doing exposure therapy.\nExposure can also be understood as a behavioral experiment that tests your client\u2019s negative fear\npredictions (Clark & Beck, 2010; Craske et al., 2014). If you remember, anxiety is about expecting bad\nthings to happen. Anxiety is fueled by your client\u2019s overestimation of the danger of a situation and an\nunderestimation of his ability to cope with both the situation and his feelings of anxiety. Clients often\npredict that something awful will happen or that their anxiety will become intolerable. For example, I\nbelieve that if I go on a roller coaster, there is a good chance that it will fall off the rails (this is an exaggerated belief in the danger of roller coasters). I also believe that I will become so anxious that I will be\nunable to stop screaming (this is an exaggerated belief in my inability to cope).\nThe exposure task is an experiment that tests the accuracy of your client\u2019s negative predictions. By\nfacing his fears, your client learns that the situation is not dangerous and that he can cope with both\nthe situation and his feelings of anxiety. Your client will also learn that when feared situations are\nfaced, over time, anxiety diminishes. By the way, I did go on a roller coaster recently; it did not crash,\nI did scream, and by the end of the ride I actually enjoyed it!\nHOW AVOIDING MAINTAINS FEARS\nThe key treatment component in exposure is to stop avoiding and to repeatedly confront your fears\nuntil you are no longer afraid. When we avoid situations, initially our anxiety decreases as we leave the\nfeared situation. However, in the long term our anxiety increases because when we avoid we never learn\nthat the situation is not dangerous and that we can cope. Over time, the number of situations we fear\nexpands. We are caught in a self-fulfilling cycle. Take a look at Figure 11.1, the Cycle of Avoidance; you\ncan see how avoiding leads to more avoiding and more anxiety and becomes a vicious cycle.\n[Page 236]\nExposure Therapy\u2014Clients Face Their Fears 225\nAnxiety-Provoking Situation\nNever tests Prediction:\nwhether Situation is\npredictions dangerous;\nare accurate I cannot cope.\nConsequence:\nLess contact\nwith anxiety- Anxiety\nprovoking\nsituations\nAvoid\nanxietyprovoking\nsituation\nFigure 11.1. Cycle of avoidance.\nCan exposure therapy help Suzanne? At this point in therapy, Suzanne is doing better. She has been\nlistening to music on the way to work and arriving in a better mood. She has also started socializing\nagain with her old friends. As her mood has lifted, her relationship with her husband has improved and\nher mornings with the children have become less difficult. So generally things at home are going better.\nHowever, she still dislikes her new school and hardly interacts with the other teachers. Let\u2019s see if exposure therapy can help her.\nFirst let\u2019s check if the cycle of avoidance applies to Suzanne. Situations that involve interacting\nwith other teachers have become increasingly anxiety provoking for Suzanne. She believes that the\nother teachers do not want to be her friend and that even if she tried they would not like her (negative\npredictions). She is coping by avoiding almost all social contact. Since she avoids social contact, she\nnever gets to check whether her negative predictions are accurate. In addition, if Suzanne is avoiding\nthe other teachers, how do you think they react to her? Most likely they leave her alone, which reinforces her thought that they are unfriendly. Suzanne is caught in a vicious cycle.\n[Page 237]\n226 CBT Made Simple\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 11.1: Suzanne Avoids the Other Teachers\nPractice applying the cycle of avoidance.\nRole of safety behaviors. Anxiety is maintained not only by avoidance, but also by what are called\nsafety behaviors; I think of them as \u201cfake\u201d safety behaviors. Fake safety behaviors increase how safe you\nfeel; they do not actually decrease the danger of the situation. Real safety behaviors, such as wearing a\nseat belt or looking both ways before crossing the street, do in fact increase your safety. For example, if\nI was only willing to get on a roller coaster with my daughter, having my daughter with me in the roller\ncoaster is a fake safety behavior\u2014if the roller coaster crashes, will it help if my daughter is with me? The\nproblem with safety behaviors is as long as you use them, you never learn that you can cope without\nthem.\nThe best way I know to explain safety behaviors is to tell you one of my favorite jokes. Harry is\nwalking along the street, when he sees his old friend George. George is shaking his head from side to\nside saying, \u201cshush, shush.\u201d Harry goes up to George and says, \u201cGeorge, great to see you, but why are\nyou saying, \u2018shush, shush\u2019?\u201d George pauses. \u201cI am keeping the zebras away.\u201d Harry is a bit stunned. \u201cBut\nGeorge, there are no zebras in America!\u201d George smiles and says, \u201cSee, it works!\u201d So, why have I told\nyou this silly joke? Saying \u201cshush, shush\u201d is George\u2019s safety behavior. Because he always says, \u201cshush,\nshush,\u201d he never learns that if he stops, there still will be no zebras in America.\nIt can take a while to learn to recognize safety behaviors. They generally fall into four categories\n(Abramowitz, Deacon, & Whiteside, 2011):\nAvoidance. Never putting your hand up in class to avoid sounding stupid; avoiding elevators\nbecause you fear they will fall.\nChecking, reassurance seeking, and rehearsal. Repeatedly checking if the door is locked; spending hours searching the Internet for information on every small ache and pain; mentally rehearsing\nwhat you say in casual conversations to be sure you do not look silly.\nCompulsive rituals. Washing your hands for half an hour after you go to the bathroom; needing\nto check twelve times that the windows are closed before you go to bed.\nSafety signals (objects you carry or have near you to be sure you are safe, even though the chances\nof needing them are slight or they could not really help). Having another person or an animal with\nyou; making sure your cell phone is in your pocket with your finger on the emergency button in\ncase you need to call for assistance.\nThe problem with safety behaviors is that they interfere with everyday functioning, and some safety\nbehaviors actually make things worse. For example, a client is worried about germs and washes his\nhands for half an hour every time he goes to the washroom. This interferes with his ability to get his\nwork and other tasks done, and, if excessive, can cause irritation and skin problems. A client with\nsocial anxiety is worried that she looks messy and awkward. While talking to a friend she constantly\nchecks her hair. The constant checking makes her hair look messy, annoys and distracts her friend, and\nmakes the client look awkward.\n[Page 238]\nExposure Therapy\u2014Clients Face Their Fears 227\nDuring exposure therapy, clients give up their safety behaviors in a planned, systematic manner so\nthey can see that it is possible to cope without them.\nIdentify your clients\u2019 safety behaviors. Sometimes when clients describe their anxiety, they include\ntheir safety behaviors. For example, when a client of mine described her fear of flying, she mentioned\nthat she always has two or three glasses of wine before getting on the plane, to numb the anxiety. The\nwine is her safety behavior; she believes she needs it to tolerate the anxiety of flying.\nYou can also ask your clients directly about their safety behaviors. Next time one of your clients is\ndescribing her anxiety, try using Questions to Assess Your Client\u2019s Safety Behaviors, available as a\nhandout at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\n\u2022 Are there things or situations you avoid because of your anxiety?\n\u2022 Are there things you do to make yourself feel safe, or to be prepared in case of danger, such as\ncarrying things or being with certain people?\n\u2022 Is there anything you do to make yourself feel comfortable in situations where you feel anxious?\nYOUR TURN!\nIdentify Suzanne\u2019s Safety Behaviors\nSee if you can help Suzanne identify her safety behaviors.\nTherapist: W e\u2019ve been talking about how anxious you feel around the other teachers at\nwork, and generally how hard it\u2019s been for you to make friends. I am wondering\nif there are things you do to make yourself feel more comfortable when you are\nwith them.\nSuzanne: Well, I guess I have just been trying to avoid everyone as much as possible.\nLook at three possible responses below and pick the one that will help Suzanne identify her safety\nbehaviors.\n1. What are some of your thoughts when you feel anxious?\n2. Is there anything you do to make yourself feel more comfortable in situations where you have\nto interact with the other teachers?\n3. What are some of the worst situations for you, when you feel the most anxious?\nResponse #2 is the best response to help Suzanne identify her safety behaviors. Response #1 would be\na good response if you wanted to explore her thoughts, but that is not the task at the moment.\nResponse #3 would be a good question if you were starting to develop a hierarchy of situations, but\nnot for identifying safety behaviors.\n[Page 239]\n228 CBT Made Simple\nTherapist: I s there anything you do to make yourself feel more comfortable in situations\nwhere you have to interact with the other teachers?\nSuzanne: I f I really have to interact with them I try very hard to say something smart or\nfunny. I will often rehearse a comment in my mind before saying it.\nTherapist: Anything else that you do to feel comfortable?\nSuzanne: W ell, I usually wait until someone asks me a question before speaking. That way\nI don\u2019t have to talk as much.\nSuzanne identified two safety behaviors. The first is to rehearse in her mind what she will say\nbefore speaking. Do you think this will make her more or less fluent as a speaker? More or less anxious?\nThe second safety behavior is waiting to talk until someone asks her a question. Is that likely to make\nher more or less engaged in the conversation?\nOne of the difficulties with safety behaviors is that there can be a fine line between coping and\nsafety behaviors. For example, before cutting a piece of wood it is good practice to double check your\nmeasurements; however, checking six times becomes a safety behavior. Some safety behaviors are\nbenign. For example, if my daughter is happy to come with me on roller coasters, and I will only go on\na roller coaster if she is with me, this is a benign safety behavior. The assessment issue is whether the\nbehavior interferes with your client\u2019s functioning or causes her to avoid a situation that is not dangerous\nin reality.\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 11.2: Maia Was Attacked\nPractice identifying safety behaviors.\nIS EXPOSURE EFFECTIVE?\nThe answer is yes; in fact, exposure therapy is considered the most effective treatment we have for\nfear and anxiety disorders (Clark & Beck, 2010). Exposure has been used effectively for a variety of\nanxiety-related disorders, including panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social anxiety\ndisorder, PTSD, health anxiety, and specific phobias (Abramowitz et al., 2011; Clark & Beck, 2010).\nDespite its effectiveness, exposure therapy does not work 100 percent of the time. Some clients do not\nrespond, and for some clients, after successful treatment, fears return. Researchers are exploring factors\nthat predict who will respond and how to make exposure more effective.\nOVERVIEW OF EXPOSURE THERAPY\nThere are three types of exposure: in vivo, virtual, and imaginal. In vivo exposure involves exposure to what you actually fear. For example, if you fear needles, exposure tasks would involve an actual\nneedle. Virtual exposure involves using the Internet, or another medium, to simulate the experience\n[Page 240]\nExposure Therapy\u2014Clients Face Their Fears 229\nyou fear. Often exposure to fear of flying relies on virtual exposure. Imaginal exposure is when your\nclient uses his imagination to experience the situation. It is used primarily when in vivo or virtual\nexposure is not feasible. Trauma work usually relies on imaginal exposure to help clients face their\ntrauma memories.\nA word of caution: if your clients have poor impulse control, difficulty controlling their substance\nuse, or suicidal ideation or urges, or if they engage in self-injurious behavior when under stress, it is\ngenerally not recommended to use exposure until they are stabilized (Taylor, 2006).\nExposure therapy generally occurs in three phases: preparing to do exposure, implementing exposure, and debriefing after exposure.\nAgenda Item #2: Prepare to Do Exposure\nBefore you actually implement exposure, you want to prepare your client by going through the following steps:\n1. Identify the fear your client wants to address.\n2. Help your client understand how avoiding maintains his fears.\n3. Explain exposure.\n4. Develop a hierarchy of feared objects or situations.\nIDENTIFY THE FEAR YOUR CLIENT WANTS TO ADDRESS\nYou can use exposure in almost any situation where your client copes by avoiding. Suzanne was\nsocially anxious, and in particular she was anxious about interacting with other teachers and colleagues\nat her new school. Below is a list of other types of fears you could treat with exposure. Take a moment\nto think of your clients and whether any of their fears fit into these categories.\n\u2022 Fear of living creatures: Clients may fear dogs, insects, or human beings who remind them of\nan individual who hurt them.\n\u2022 Fear of inanimate objects: Many clients fear germs, toilet seats, blood, or needles.\n\u2022 Fear of specific situations: Clients may fear going to the dentist, public speaking, all kinds of\nsocial situations, and places that remind them of where they were hurt.\n\u2022 Fear of specific thoughts, memories, or images: Clients with PTSD fear remembering the\ntrauma; clients with OCD have specific thoughts that they try to avoid.\n\u2022 Fear of specific physiological reactions: Clients can fear the sensation of having to cry, the\nphysical symptoms related to going to the bathroom, or vomiting. Individuals with panic disorder fear the physical symptoms of anxiety.\n[Page 241]\n230 CBT Made Simple\nAVOIDING IS NOT THE SOLUTION\nExposure is hard work. Unless clients understand the negative consequences of avoiding, they will\nnot be motivated to engage in exposure. Many clients are so used to avoiding that they minimize the\nimpact on their lives. I find the following questions helpful:\n\u2022 How is avoiding a problem for you?\n\u2022 If you were not avoiding this situation, how would your life be different? What would you be\ndoing differently?\n\u2022 Why is it important to you to stop avoiding?\nWhen Suzanne\u2019s therapist explored the consequences of avoiding social contact with the other\nteachers, Suzanne realized that she was lonely and felt isolated.\nYou can also increase motivation to engage in exposure tasks by linking cessation of avoiding to\nyour client\u2019s values. An important value for Suzanne is being friendly and having good relationships\nwith other people. When Suzanne saw the connection between interacting with the other teachers and\nacting on her values, her motivation to stop avoiding social contact at school increased. Especially if\nclients are hesitant to engage in exposure, I examine how the exposure task is related to values that are\nimportant to them.\nEXPLAIN EXPOSURE\nExposure involves asking clients to do what they fear most. They need to trust you. I tell my clients\nthat I will not ask them to do anything they do not want to do. I fully explain exposure and communicate my optimism. I often say, \u201cThis will initially be hard, but I think you will be glad you did it.\u201d\nI model a matter-of-fact attitude toward anxiety: anxiety is unpleasant but not dangerous. I let my\nclients know that anxiety will decrease as they avoid less and face their fears. I cannot promise to eliminate anxiety, but I can help them learn to cope with their anxiety. Below is how I generally explain\nexposure to my clients, of course, tailoring the explanation to each client. You can find Explain\nExposure to Your Clients at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\nWe have been talking about how you avoid situations that make you anxious. We have also\ntalked about how avoiding these situations has not helped and has actually caused you some\ndifficulties. We have also talked about how being able to do the activity you have been avoiding is related to some very important values for you. (Only say this if you have been able to\nmake the link to your client\u2019s values.)\nI think exposure therapy would be a very helpful treatment for you. Exposure therapy\ninvolves facing your fears. We will make a list of the situations that make you anxious, starting\nwith situations that are fairly easy and going up to situations that are hard for you. We will start\nwith the easiest and see if together we can help you learn to cope with the situation.\nOnce you have learned to cope with the easiest situation, we will progress to more difficult\nones. We will work together and go at whatever pace works for you. How does that sound to\nyou? (I pause to check if my client has any questions.) As you face your fears, you will learn not\nto be afraid.\n[Page 242]\nExposure Therapy\u2014Clients Face Their Fears 231\nI want to talk a bit about anxiety. You will feel some anxiety as we do the exposure tasks.\nBut that\u2019s okay; you need to feel some anxiety for exposure to be effective. We\u2019ll go slowly.\nAlso, the more we face what makes us anxious, the less anxious we feel. This means that the\nmore you do the exposure tasks, the less anxious you will feel and the more you will learn to\nmanage your anxiety.\nYOUR TURN!\n\uf0b2\nPractice in Your Imagination: Explain Exposure Therapy\nI would like you to imagine explaining exposure therapy to a client. Before you start, rate from 1 to 10\nhow comfortable you feel explaining exposure therapy. At the end of the exercise rate your level of\ncomfort again to see if it changed. Now, let\u2019s start this exercise.\nChose a client who you think would benefit from using exposure therapy. Try to get a picture of\nhim or her in your mind. Now, imagine yourself in your office with your client. See your office; notice\nthe sounds and smells in the room. Imagine that you want to explain exposure therapy. Read over the\nwords I suggested while imagining yourself saying them. You can also use your own phrases. Really hear\nand feel yourself explaining exposure therapy. Imagine explaining exposure therapy two more times\nwith the same client. Each time, imagine that your client responds positively.\nDEVELOP A FEAR HIERARCHY\nA fear hierarchy is a list of situations that are increasingly anxiety provoking for your client. Fear\nhierarchies usually include objects or situations that are either increasingly similar in some way to the\nfeared stimulus or involve physically approaching the feared stimulus. For example, if a client is afraid\nof spiders, a hierarchy of similar stimuli might include looking at a picture of a spider, touching a plastic\nspider, looking at a real spider, and finally touching a real spider. If a client was avoiding a street where\nshe had been assaulted, a hierarchy based on physically approaching the feared stimulus might start\nwith standing four blocks away, progressing to standing three blocks away, then two blocks away, and\neventually standing on the street where the assault occurred.\nI ask clients to give me examples of situations they find fairly easy, moderately hard, and very difficult. Here is Suzanne\u2019s list of anxiety-provoking situations related to engaging in more social situations at school. Her therapist asked her to list three situations for each level of difficulty.\nFairly easy:\n\u2022 Saying hello to other teachers I pass in the hall when I arrive at school\n\u2022 Saying hello to another teacher on the way to recess\n\u2022 Saying hello to the teacher next to me at assembly\n[Page 243]\n232 CBT Made Simple\nModerately hard:\n\u2022 Eating in the lunch room and sitting down at a table with the other teachers\n\u2022 Starting a conversation with the teacher next to me at assembly\n\u2022 Asking for help with a school-related task, for example how to use the copier or where a\nresource is located\nVery difficult:\n\u2022 Asking another teacher to have lunch with me\n\u2022 Making a comment at a staff meeting\n\u2022 Volunteering to participate in the school play and letting the other teachers know that I have\nexperience\nWhen creating fear hierarchies, clients rate the difficulty of the tasks and their anxiety using subjective units of distress, or SUDS. A SUDS of 100 is the most anxious your client has ever been, and a\n0 is not at all anxious. Using SUDS ratings helps clients keep track of their level of anxiety. You can\ndownload an example of a fear hierarchy that I used with a client who was afraid to go into a subway\ncar after an accident. (See Sean\u2019s Fear Hierarchy at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.)\n\uf09d\u0081 Exercise 11.3: Aiden Uses a Knife Again\nPractice developing a fear hierarchy.\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 11.1: Develop a Fear Hierarchy\nAgenda Item #3: Implement Exposure\nYou are now ready to start doing exposure. This phase involves developing effective exposure tasks,\nidentifying your client\u2019s negative predictions, and actually doing exposure.\nDEVELOP EFFECTIVE EXPOSURE TASKS\nExposure tasks should be sufficiently easy to ensure success, but sufficiently difficult that your\nclient learns that exposure works. I usually start with a task that has a SUDS rating of around 30 to 40.\n[Page 244]\nExposure Therapy\u2014Clients Face Their Fears 233\nThere are three criteria for good exposure tasks:\n1. The task is sufficiently specific and concrete that it is clear to your client what he will do as\nwell as when and where he will do the task, and he will be able to measure whether he was\nsuccessful.\n2. The task specifies an action your client will do, and not how he will feel.\n3. The task is under your client\u2019s control.\nLet\u2019s look at a couple of tasks and see if they meet these criteria.\nTask Specific and Action the In Client\u2019s Conclusion:\nConcrete? Client Can Do? Control? Is This an\nEffective Task?\nImpress my boss No, not clear No, not clear No, can\u2019t control No\nwith a good what he will do, what he will do whether your\nBETTER TASK:\nquestion when or where boss will be\nAsk one question\nimpressed\nat staff meeting.\nWalk in the area Not sufficiently Yes, client can Yes, in client\u2019s No\nwhere I was specific. Where walk control\nBETTER TASK:\nassaulted will client walk?\nWalk for fifteen\nFor how long?\nminutes, three blocks\nfrom where the\nassault took place.\n[Page 245]\n234 CBT Made Simple\nYOUR TURN!\nDevelop Effective Exposure Tasks\nLook at the two exposure tasks below and decide whether they are (1) sufficiently specific, (2) an action\nthat the client can do, and (3) under the client\u2019s control. If you do not think they are good tasks,\ndevelop a better task. You can find my answers in the appendix.\nTask Specific and Action the In Client\u2019s Conclusion:\nConcrete? Client Can Do? Control? Is This an\nEffective Task?\nStand in front of\nthe elevator in\nmy building for 5\nminutes every day\nLook at photos\non the Internet of\ncars similar to the\none that hit me\nFIRST EXPOSURE TASK\nIf possible, either conduct the first exposure task with your client in your office or go with your\nclient to the situation he fears; that way, you can be sure that your client understands the process and\nyou are there for support. In my many years of doing exposure, I have played with plastic spiders and\nplastic knives; stood in front of elevators, subways, and streetcars; and looked at photos of cars, knives,\nand vomit. The Internet is fabulous for exposure therapy\u2014you can find photos and videos of almost\nanything!\nFor her first exposure task, Suzanne suggested starting with saying hello to teachers she passed in\nthe hall on the way to class in the morning. Her SUDS rating was a 40. The task is specific and involves\nan action that Suzanne will do. However, her therapist thought the task was not sufficiently specific,\nand it would be hard to measure whether she was successful. They decided she would say hello to at\nleast three teachers, five days a week in the morning on the way to class.\n[Page 246]\nExposure Therapy\u2014Clients Face Their Fears 235\nMOVE UP THE HIERARCHY\nOnce a client has accomplished the first task on the hierarchy, we develop the next step collaboratively. I ask my client what would be a good next task. Generally I aim for tasks with SUDS of 40 or 50,\nthough sometimes clients want to try a task with a higher SUDS rating that they feel is doable.\nTraditionally, you would not move up the hierarchy until your client\u2019s anxiety in response to the present\ntask had decreased by 50 percent. However, recent research (Craske et al., 2014) suggests that this may\nnot be necessary. I usually move up the hierarchy when my client indicates he is ready and can manage\nthe next task.\nMAKE EXPOSURE EFFECTIVE\nThere are some specific factors that can help make exposure tasks more effective.\nTasks should be frequent and prolonged. Do you think it would be more effective for me to ride a\nroller coaster three times a day for five days in a row or once a week for fifteen weeks? Probably three\ntimes a day for five days. What about a two-minute ride or a fifteen-minute ride? It is important to\nrepeat the exposure task a number of times to consolidate the learning experience.\nTasks should be varied and done in multiple contexts. Do you think I should ride one roller coaster\nat one amusement park over and over, or a variety of roller coasters in a variety of amusement parks?\nVarious roller coasters in various amusement parks will be more effective.\nExposure should be mindful. Clients often distract themselves during exposure to avoid really facing\ntheir fears. When a client is mindful, he is present in the moment (Teasdale, Williams, & Segal, 2014).\nMany of my clients say mantras, space out, close their eyes, or pretend they are not there. I use various\ngrounding techniques to help clients stay present (Dobson & Josefowitz, 2015). For example, I watch\nmy client\u2019s eyes to make sure he is looking at the anxiety-provoking stimuli, and during exposure I ask\nhim to label what he sees, to feel the ground beneath his feet, and to notice any sounds. I also ask my\nclient to notice and label his feelings or thoughts without needing to change the thoughts or the physical sensations.\nSafety behaviors should be eliminated gradually over the course of exposure therapy. Eliminating\nsafety behaviors is part of the fear hierarchy (Rachman, Shafran, Radomsky, & Zysk, 2011). For example,\na client kept a clonazepam in his pants pocket as a safety signal whenever he had to fly. As he became\nmore comfortable with flying, he moved the clonazepam to a bag at his feet, then to a bag in the overhead compartment, and finally, he flew without the clonazepam. For my roller coaster exposure, I\nwould start with riding roller coasters with my daughter (being with my daughter is my safety behavior)\nand then go on them by myself.\nBetween-session exposure tasks should be assigned. It may not be possible to conduct the exposure\ntasks with your client, as the anxiety-provoking stimuli may not be easily accessible. This occurred in\nSuzanne\u2019s case, where the exposure task involved behavior that would take place at school. A lot of\nexposure work is done between sessions, as homework. If we completed an exposure task during therapy,\nmy client\u2019s homework is usually to do the same task on his own. This enables the client to consolidate\nthe work we did together.\n[Page 247]\n236 CBT Made Simple\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 11.2: Exposure Therapy\nIDENTIFY YOUR CLIENT\u2019S NEGATIVE PREDICTIONS\nRemember that you can think of exposure as a behavioral experiment. This means you ask your\nclient to predict what will happen during the exposure task. The exposure task is a test to see if the\nprediction was accurate (Craske et al., 2014). Remember, in chapter 6 we defined anxiety as expecting\nbad things to happen and we used the following equation to understand anxiety.\nOverestimate Overestimate Underestimate\nDanger or Likelihood of Your ability to\n+ +\nAnxiety=\nd i f f i c u l t y o f situation cope\nsituation occurring\nFigure 11.2. Understand anxiety.\nI want clients to predict what will occur and how they will react so that we can examine the accuracy of their predictions and change the anxiety equation.\nClients often have \u201crealistic\u201d predictions and \u201cworst-case\u201d predictions. I ask for worst-case predictions because I want to test whether the belief that is driving the anxiety is accurate. I look for two\ntypes of predictions: first, what is my client\u2019s worst fear, or what is he most worried will occur? I then\nask my client to rate the likelihood of his prediction occurring. Second, I ask my client to predict his\nworst fear about how he will react\u2014about how he will feel, about the symptoms of these feelings, and\nabout what he will do. I then ask him to rate the likelihood of this occurring. It is important that the\npredictions are sufficiently concrete that your client can judge the accuracy of his predictions. Often a\nclient\u2019s prediction involves how he or other people will feel. Try to specify the behaviors your client\npredicts will happen as a consequence of the feelings; predictions that are behaviors are easier to assess\nthan predictions that involve feelings. For example, if a client predicts he will be anxious, ask what he\nis afraid he will do because of his anxiety, or what symptoms he is afraid he will have. For example, is\nhe afraid he will talk too quickly, or blush, or have a crushing feeling in his chest? If a client predicts\nthat a friend will be bored, ask how he will know that the friend is bored.\n[Page 248]\nExposure Therapy\u2014Clients Face Their Fears 237\nBelow are some examples of predictions.\nExposure Task What are you most worried will How am I most worried I will\noccur?

You can download\nQuestions to Identify Your Client\u2019s Predictions During Exposure at http://www.newharbinger.com\n/38501.\nI start with saying, \u201cWhen you think of doing the exposure task,\u201d\n\u2022 What is your worst-case scenario?\n\u2022 What is your worst fear about what will happen, including how other people will react?\n\u2022 What is your worst fear about how you will feel, including your worst fear of the symptoms you\nwill have?\n\u2022 What is your worst fear about what you will do or how you will behave?\n\u2022 What do you imagine will happen? Do you see it happening? (Clients often have images of\nwhat will occur during the exposure task.)\nSuzanne\u2019s therapist asked her what was the worst that could happen if she said hello to the teachers\nin the hall. Suzanne responded that she would be anxious and rated her anxiety a 5 out of 10. Her\nworst-case scenario was that she would say hello in a hesitant and awkward manner and her face would\nturn bright red. She rated the likelihood of being hesitant at 75 percent and turning bright red at 45\n[Page 249]\n238 CBT Made Simple\npercent. Suzanne\u2019s therapist then asked for her worst-case scenario of how she expected the other\nteachers to react. Suzanne responded that the other teachers will \u201cignore me and walk past me without\nsaying anything.\u201d She had a clear image of two teachers in particular smirking at her. Suzanne now has\na concrete prediction that she can assess. Suzanne\u2019s therapist wrote down her worst-case predictions\nand her likelihood ratings so that they had a record to refer back to.\nIn exposure therapy you do not verbally challenge your client\u2019s predictions, no matter how farfetched they may seem. You write them down and use the exposure task as an experiment to test\nwhether the prediction is accurate.\nAgenda Item #4: Do Postexposure Debriefing\nOnce your client has completed the exposure task, you want to discuss what he learned.\nMONITOR OUTCOME OF EXPOSURE TASKS\nIt is helpful if your client can monitor, on a written worksheet, the outcome of his exposure task\nand his anxiety level. This provides data that can be used to challenge his predictions. I ask clients to\nmonitor their anxiety every five minutes if the task involves staying in a situation for a prolonged period\nof time, or until their anxiety decreases. In Suzanne\u2019s case, she recorded her anxiety at the beginning\nand the end of the task. Below is Suzanne\u2019s monitoring worksheet.\nTask: Say hello to three teachers a day on the way to class in the morning.\nNumber of Teachers Anxiety (SUDS)\nSaid Hello To\nStart of Task End of Task\nMonday 3 40 40\nTuesday 3 40 35\nWednesday 4 30 25\nThursday 5 20 10\nFriday 5 10 10\n[Page 250]\nExposure Therapy\u2014Clients Face Their Fears 239\nCOMPLETE THE POSTEXPOSURE DEBRIEFING\nThe next step is to debrief or explore what your clients learned from the exposure task. I use the\nanxiety equation we looked at earlier as the conceptual model that guides my debriefing. You want to\nreview:\n\u2022 The accuracy of your client\u2019s initial predictions\n\u2022 The danger or difficulty of the situation\n\u2022 Your client\u2019s ability to cope with the task and with his anxiety\n\u2022 What happens to anxiety with exposure\nIn debriefing, you are gathering evidence and looking for facts that will enable your client to evaluate the accuracy of his prediction. I usually use the Are My Predictions Accurate? worksheet, which\nyou can download at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501. Let\u2019s look at how Suzanne and her therapist\ncompleted the worksheet.\nAre My Predictions Accurate?\nExposure Task Your Predictions Gather Data What Did You\n(Likelihood of Learn?\nHappening: 0\u2013100)\nSpecific? 1.

My image was not\n4. Clear image of accurate.\nteacher smirking\nYou will use the data you collected to debrief and assess whether your client\u2019s predictions were\naccurate. I explore both my clients\u2019 ability to stay in the anxiety-provoking situation and their ability to\ntolerate anxiety. Anxious clients often use their anxiety as a sign that they need to avoid the situation.\nI want my clients to learn that they don\u2019t need to listen to their anxiety but rather can make decisions\nabout how they want to behave. You also want to reinforce that anxiety will decrease with exposure.\nLet\u2019s look at how we might debrief with Suzanne. Notice how her therapist helps Suzanne reach her\nown conclusions and then reinforces the conclusions.\nWas Suzanne\u2019s prediction accurate in relation to the danger or difficulty of the situation?\nTherapist: Do you remember what you predicted would occur if you went up to teachers and said\nhello?\nSuzanne: Yes, I predicted that they would ignore me, and two teachers would smirk.\nTherapist: And what occurred?\nSuzanne: Almost all of them smiled and said hello back.\nTherapist: Hmmm, what do you make of that?\nThe therapist is asking Suzanne to reach her own conclusions.\nSuzanne: I guess my prediction was wrong; people were friendly.\nTherapist: (smiling) Can you say that again?\nThe therapist is reinforcing Suzanne\u2019s conclusions by asking Suzanne to repeat her conclusion.\n[Page 252]\nExposure Therapy\u2014Clients Face Their Fears 241\nSuzanne: (laughing slightly) People were friendly.\nTherapist: I think that is a very important observation.\nWas Suzanne able to cope with the task and her anxiety?\nTherapist: When you started the task, on the first day, where was your anxiety?\nSuzanne: It was at a 40.\nTherapist: And were you still able to say hello to the other teachers and accomplish the task?\nSuzanne: Yes, I was.\nTherapist: The fact that you were able to say hello to teachers even though you were anxious, what\ndoes that tell you about needing to avoid if you are anxious?\nSuzanne: I guess I can still do things, even if I am anxious. It seems that just because I am anxious,\nI don\u2019t have to avoid.\nYOUR TURN!\nContinue Debriefing with Suzanne\nTry using what you\u2019ve learned to help Suzanne understand the effects of exposure on her anxiety.\nTherapist: I \u2019m curious what happened to your anxiety over the course of the week as you\nsaid hello to the other teachers.\nSuzanne: Well, it got easier and easier, and my anxiety went down.\nLook at the three responses below. How could you help Suzanne reach her own conclusions about\nthe effect of exposure on anxiety?\n1. I think that\u2019s great. This is exactly what we would expect from exposure therapy. The more you\ndo a task, the easier it will be and the less anxious you will be.\n2. Given that your anxiety went down, what did you learn about what happens to anxiety when\nyou do exposure?\n3. What helped you confront the task?\nResponse #2 is the best response to help Suzanne reach her own conclusions. Response #1 would be\na good response after Suzanne had reached her own conclusions in order to reinforce them. Response\n#3 would be a good question if you wanted to understand how Suzanne had motivated herself.\n[Page 253]\n242 CBT Made Simple\nCONSOLIDATE WHAT YOUR CLIENT LEARNED\nAfter you have debriefed the exposure task, you want to help your client consolidate what he\nlearned. I use three approaches: developing a more accurate prediction, imaginal rehearsal, and review.\nTo develop a more accurate prediction, I refer to my client\u2019s original prediction and then ask what\nwould be a more accurate prediction, given what occurred during the exposure task. I encourage my\nclient to write down his new prediction. Next I use imaginal rehearsal to review the outcome of the\nexposure task and the new prediction. In Suzanne\u2019s case her new prediction was that the teachers\nwould be friendly when she said hello. Her therapist asked her to create an image and see the various\nteachers smiling at her and saying hello. Her therapist then asked Suzanne to review this memory three\ntimes a day as part of her homework.\n\uf0be\u0081\nVideo 11.3: Debrief After Exposure\nAgenda Item #5: Discuss Relapse Prevention\nOne of the difficulties with exposure treatment is that fears can return after treatment (Craske &\nMystkowski, 2006). I explain to clients that exposure is similar to exercise. Even if you exercise every\nday and get into really good shape, you have to keep exercising or you will not stay in shape. Exposure\nis similar; you have to keep practicing for the benefits to last. At the end of therapy, I explain the principles of relapse prevention:\n\u2022 Continue to face situations you previously avoided. Remember: anxiety is not a reason to\navoid.\n\u2022 The more you face your fears, the easier it becomes. Remember: anxiety is normal and exposure works.\nHomework: Practice CBT\nBefore continuing with the next chapter, take some time to try the homework.\nApply What You Learned to a Clinical Example\nComplete the following exercises.\n\uf09d\nExercise 11.1: Suzanne Avoids the Other Teachers\nExercise 11.2: Maia Was Attacked\nExercise 11.3: Aiden Uses a Knife Again\n[Page 254]\nExposure Therapy\u2014Clients Face Their Fears 243\nApply What You Learned to Your Own Life\nAfter you have completed the homework assignments below, pause and take a moment to think\nabout what you learned about yourself. Then, think about the implications of your experience with\nthese exercises for your therapy with clients.\nHomework Assignment #1\nIdentify Your Own Safety Behaviors\nThink of a situation in the past month where you were anxious. What did you do to make yourself more\ncomfortable? For example, did you carry an object or be with a certain person? Did any of your strategies involve avoidance, checking, reassurance and rehearsal, compulsive rituals, or safety signals? What\nwas the consequence of your safety behavior?\nHomework Assignment #2\nDevelop a Fear Hierarchy\nTry to think of any situations that you have been avoiding. It could be a social situation or a specific\nfear.\n1. Develop a fear hierarchy for your problem. Think of situations that are fairly easy, moderately\nhard, and very difficult.\n2. Choose a first task; make sure it is concrete, an action that you can perform, and in your\ncontrol.\n3. Make a prediction of what will occur if you do the first task.\n4. Now, it is up to you to try the task.\nApply What You Learned to Your Therapy Practice\nFor this next assignment, think of a client whom you are currently working with and who suffers\nfrom anxiety.\n[Page 255]\n244 CBT Made Simple\nHomework Assignment #3\nIdentify Your Client\u2019s Safety Behaviors\nOnce you have chosen a client, complete the following steps.\n1. Ask one or two questions from the handout Questions to Assess Your Client\u2019s Safety Behaviors.\n\u2022 Are there things or situations you avoid because of your anxiety?\n\u2022 Are there things you do to make yourself feel safe or to be prepared in case of danger,\nsuch as carry things or be with certain people?\n\u2022 Is there anything you do to make yourself feel comfortable in situations where you feel\nanxious?\n2. If your client is avoiding, ask how avoiding is a problem in his life.\n3. Once you have identified your client\u2019s safety behavior, explain safety behaviors and explore the\nconsequences of the client\u2019s safety behavior.\nHomework Assignment #4\nDevelop a Fear Hierarchy\nThink of a client who is avoiding and who you think would benefit from facing his or her fears.\n1. Develop a fear hierarchy with this client. Identify situations that are fairly easy, moderately\nhard, and very difficult.\n2. Identify a first exposure task. Make sure it is concrete, an action your client will take, and\nunder his or her control.\n3. Ask your client to predict what he or she thinks will occur.\n4. Steps 1 through 3 may be enough for your first experience with developing a hierarchy.\nHowever, if you feel you are ready, and it would be helpful to your client, ask your client to try\nthis first task.\n5. Check whether your client\u2019s predictions were accurate.\n[Page 256]\nExposure Therapy\u2014Clients Face Their Fears 245\nLet\u2019s Review\nAnswer the questions under each agenda item.\nAgenda Item #1: What is exposure?\n\u2022 What is the central theory of exposure?\nAgenda Item #2: Prepare to do exposure.\n\u2022 What two things do you want to do before you start exposure?\nAgenda Item #3: Implement exposure.\n\u2022 What are three factors that make for an effective exposure task?\nAgenda Item #4: Do postexposure debriefing.\n\u2022 Why is it important to have a postexposure debriefing?\nAgenda Item #5: Discuss relapse prevention.\n\u2022 What are two important things to tell your clients about relapse prevention?\nWhat Was Important to You?\nWhat idea(s) or concept(s) would you like to remember?\nWhat idea(s) or skill(s) would you like to apply to your own life?\nWhat would you like to try this coming week with a client?

Did you notice your own or one of your client\u2019s safety\nbehaviors? Did you identify any clients who you thought might benefit from exposure? What about\nexplaining exposure or developing a fear hierarchy?\nIf you did not have a chance to do the homework, think of a situation you are currently avoiding,\nand try to develop a plan to face your fear.\nSet the Agenda\nAlthough Suzanne and Raoul are composites of a number of clients, they are based on my clinical\nexperience. I want to give you a sense of how their therapy unfolded and how I used the various interventions we covered in the book. The preceding chapters were too short to cover everything we did in\nSuzanne\u2019s and Raoul\u2019s therapy, so I\u2019ve included some of the additional interventions in this final\nchapter. However, I want to start with discussing core beliefs.\nAgenda Item #1: Identify Suzanne\u2019s and Raoul\u2019s core beliefs.\nAgenda Item #2: Suzanne\u2019s therapy\nAgenda Item #3: Raoul\u2019s therapy\nWork the Agenda\nUp to now we have focused on automatic thoughts and behavior. I want to look at how we can use core\nbeliefs to understand Suzanne and Raoul.\nAgenda Item #1: Identify Suzanne\u2019s and Raoul\u2019s Core Beliefs\nAutomatic thoughts are situation specific and are just below consciousness. This means that it is\nfairly easy to teach people to notice their automatic thoughts and then to evaluate and modify them.\n[Page 260]\nSuzanne\u2019s and Raoul\u2019s Therapy 249\nCore beliefs are stable, deeply held beliefs that affect how you feel and behave in many different situations. It is much harder to identify and modify core beliefs than automatic thoughts. Most CBT focuses\non modifying automatic thoughts and behaviors.\nIn chapter 1 we talked about how we all have core beliefs about the self, others, and the world. Core\nbeliefs can be negative or positive. Examples of core beliefs about one\u2019s self might be I am lovable or I am\nincapable; examples of core beliefs about others might be People do not care about me or People will try to\nhelp me; and examples of core beliefs about the world might be The future will be good or The world is\nunpredictable.\nI want to go over three approaches for identifying core beliefs: (1) noticing patterns in problematic\nsituations and automatic thoughts, (2) identifying themes in a client\u2019s psychosocial history, and (3) the\ndownward arrow technique.\nNOTICING PATTERNS IN AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS\nCore beliefs are basically an information-processing filter; they influence what you notice, the\nmeaning you give to events, and what you remember. You can think of core beliefs as large magnets\nthat go around attracting and picking up information that confirms the core belief. People either don\u2019t\nnotice information that contradicts their core beliefs or minimize the information. For example, before\nSuzanne started therapy, how would you expect her to react if a teacher came up to her at recess and\nsaid hello? Would she think (A) I am starting to make friends; this teacher likes me or (B) This is a fluke;\nI am sure that she won\u2019t talk to me tomorrow? I would guess B. What about when she gets home at night\nand her husband asks her about her day? Will she remember the teacher who came up to her, or will\nshe remember that a lot of the time she was alone at recess? I would guess she will remember that she\nwas alone. We can look for patterns in the types of situations that are stressful for our clients and patterns in the types of automatic thoughts that cause our clients\u2019 distress. Once we identify these patterns, we can start to hypothesize about our clients\u2019 core beliefs.\nI find it helpful to think of core beliefs about the self as falling into three areas: (1) judgments about\nhow competent or incompetent one is; this includes beliefs related to being helpless, unintelligent, or\nincapable; (2) judgments about how lovable or unlovable one is; this includes beliefs related to being\nunattractive, unlikable, vulnerable, or different; and (3) judgments about how basically worthy or\nworthless one is; this involves a very deep sense of being basically an okay person or a deep sense of\nsomething being horribly wrong with you. Core beliefs related to worthlessness often are the result of\nsevere childhood abuse. Noticing which category is the most triggering for your client can help you\nfocus on situations and thoughts that are central to your client\u2019s distress. When I look for patterns in\nmy client\u2019s automatic thoughts, I ask myself which of the three categories seems the most relevant to\nmy client.\nSuzanne\u2019s core beliefs. Let\u2019s think about Suzanne. The major stressors in her life have been a new\nschool, which has disrupted her friendships and family relationships; her best friend moving away; and\nher mother-in-law\u2019s illness. From what you know, would you expect her core beliefs to center on competence, lovability, or worthlessness? It seems to me that the types of situations that caused her stress\nwere social.\nSuzanne\u2019s negative thoughts frequently center on not being liked or feeling accepted. At both the\nbarbecue and recess, her thoughts are related to the other teachers not liking her or not wanting to be\n[Page 261]\n250 CBT Made Simple\nher friend. When her husband didn\u2019t give their son a bath, one of her thoughts was He doesn\u2019t care about\nme. During the exposure tasks, she didn\u2019t expect people to react positively to her friendly overtures.\nWhat would you hypothesize were Suzanne\u2019s core beliefs? When we examine the type of situations\nthat she found stressful and the pattern to her automatic thoughts, I would hypothesize that these were\nher core beliefs:\nCore belief about self: I am not lovable.\nCore belief about others: People will not like me and will not be friendly.\nCore belief about the world: The world is not safe.\nRaoul\u2019s core beliefs. From what you know of Raoul, what would you guess were his core beliefs? Being\npassed over for a promotion triggered his difficulties. I would hypothesize that being successful is very\nimportant to Raoul. This leads me to hypothesize that his core beliefs would center more on being\ncompetent than on being lovable. I wondered if one of his core beliefs about self was I am only valuable\nif I achieve, or maybe, If I fail, this is proof that I am stupid. I also wondered if there was an underlying\ncore belief: I am incompetent.\nWhat about his core beliefs about others? I noticed that he doesn\u2019t trust his boss or colleagues to\nbe supportive and helpful. However, he has a good relationship with his wife and children. I wondered\nif one of his core beliefs about others was You can\u2019t trust people outside the family. What about his core\nbelief about the world? Raoul was very upset about being passed over and felt that it was unfair. I would\nwonder if he sees the world as unfair, and not just this one experience. These would all be initial\nhypotheses; I would want to know more information. Given my hypothesis of Raoul\u2019s core beliefs, what\nkinds of information do you think he might ignore about himself and others?\nClinical implications. Once I have a hypothesis of my client\u2019s core beliefs, I am particularly attuned to\nhow she dismisses or minimizes information that would challenge her core belief. Let\u2019s take an example.\nSuzanne tells her therapist that one of the teachers asked her if she would volunteer to be on the committee that was responsible for the winter holiday assembly. Will Suzanne think: (A) This is a good start\nto being more part of the school; I will get to know some of the teachers better or (B) I am sure I will not fit\nin? I would guess B. As her therapist, I am especially attuned to how she interprets social situations that\nmight challenge her core belief. I pay particular attention to gathering facts about the situation because\nI know that Suzanne will minimize indications that others are friendly or like her. I also know that\nSuzanne will have a hard time remembering examples that contradict her core belief and that reviewing them will be very important.\nIDENTIFY THEMES IN A CLIENT\u2019S PSYCHOSOCIAL HISTORY\nCore beliefs generally develop during childhood and are a consequence of experiences in one\u2019s\nfamily and the larger social world, though experiences in later life can also influence core beliefs. I\nknow of many shy, socially anxious children and teens who developed into outgoing young adults after\npositive experiences at camp, school, work, or college. These young people had a series of positive social\nexperiences that changed their core belief from Others will not like me to Others will respond positively to\nme. Traumatic experiences can also change core beliefs. Subsequent to trauma, many people start to\nbelieve that the world is dangerous, and if the trauma involved another person, their belief about others\n[Page 262]\nSuzanne\u2019s and Raoul\u2019s Therapy 251\nbecomes Other people can hurt you. Often individuals who experience trauma also develop core beliefs\nabout the self, such as I am vulnerable or weak or I am somehow damaged after the trauma.\nRemember in chapter 2 we talked about listening for the meaning of events when you take a psychosocial history? When I take a history, I am listening for the core messages my client learned about\nherself, others, and the world. Let\u2019s look at Suzanne\u2019s and Raoul\u2019s psychosocial history and see if we can\nhypothesize what their core beliefs might be.\nSuzanne\u2019s history. Suzanne was the eldest of four siblings. Her parents were hard-working people who\nhad enough money for the family\u2019s needs, but there was no extra. Suzanne described her parents as cold\nand strict. They had very high standards for Suzanne, expecting her to do well at school and help take\ncare of the household and her three younger brothers. They made it clear that they preferred boys, and\nshe worried about pleasing them and being good enough. Suzanne did well in school, the one area\nwhere her mother did not criticize her; otherwise, her mother was very critical of her, which Suzanne\nthought was \u201cfor her own good.\u201d Her mother was also a very anxious woman who had few friends and\nworried about whether she would fit in and whether people would like her.\nSuzanne described herself as a \u201cgood kid\u201d with no problems. She had very few friends at school,\nwhich she attributed to often being needed at home and having no time to be with her peers. She did\nmake some friends in high school, but after she refused to let her house be used for a drinking party,\nmost of the class turned against her. She graduated from high school and attended a teacher\u2019s college.\nShe was the first person in her family to go to college and was very proud of her accomplishment. She\nis married to her first boyfriend, who was her high school sweetheart.\nIf you remember, from examining the types of situations that she found stressful and the pattern to\nher automatic thoughts, I had hypothesized that her core beliefs were I am unlovable, People will not like\nme and will not be friendly, and The world is not safe. Her psychosocial history is consistent with the\ndevelopment of these core beliefs.\nRaoul\u2019s history. Raoul\u2019s family had immigrated to the United States when he was two years old. He\nlived close to his aunt and uncle and grew up in a large extended family. Raoul described having a\nhappy childhood until age eight when his father died, after which his life became more difficult. His\nmother had two jobs, and he was often home alone. He continued to see his extended family, but he\nmissed his father. In school he felt that the teachers did not respect him or his family, who had less\nmoney than many of the other families. He also had a slight learning disability, which was not diagnosed until high school. Though he tried hard at school, his teachers often complained to his mother\nthat he was not working up to his potential. He remembers being humiliated at school when he could\nnot answer questions or did poorly on a test. The one area where he did well was math. He was also on\nthe football team, which he loved. After high school, his uncle paid for his college education and he\nobtained a degree in accounting. He met his wife after college, and they have had a good marriage.\nRaoul\u2019s psychosocial history supports the development of the core beliefs we wondered about\nearlier. We hypothesized that one of his core beliefs about self was I am only valuable if I achieve, or\nmaybe, If I fail, this is proof that I am stupid. We wondered if there was an underlying core belief: I am\nincompetent. His history of not doing well in school and having a learning disability would support the\nhypothesis that one of his core beliefs about self was I am incompetent. His psychosocial history also\nsupports his core beliefs about others and the world that we identified earlier: You can\u2019t trust people\noutside the family and The world is unfair. Given my hypotheses of Raoul\u2019s core beliefs, what kinds of\ninformation do you think he might ignore about himself and others?\n[Page 263]\n252 CBT Made Simple\nDOWNWARD ARROW TECHNIQUE\nThe downward arrow technique involves starting with an automatic thought and tracing it back to\nthe core belief. Because you are accessing very deep beliefs about the self, others, and the world, you\ndon\u2019t want to use this approach until you have worked with your client for a while, have established a\nsolid relationship, and know that she is strong enough to find this kind of work helpful. As in all\ntherapy, it is important to use a gentle tone and caring curiosity.\nThe therapist starts with the automatic thought, usually a thought that is (1) a negative prediction,\nsuch as My new date will not call back; (2) a fact, such as I did not get the promotion; (3) a \u201cwhat if\u201d statement, such as What if my mother gets angry at me?; (4) a prediction of the future, such as No one will talk\nto me at the party; or (5) a thought about self, such as I did not study hard enough to get good grades. The\ntherapist then asks, \u201cIf the thought was true, what would that mean?\u201d Additionally, I sometimes ask,\n\u201cWhat would that mean about you?\u201d or, \u201cIf that was true, how would that be a problem for you?\u201d\nLet\u2019s look at a brief example. One of Suzanne\u2019s thoughts at the barbecue was I will stand there\nlooking awkward. Let\u2019s see what happens when we use the downward arrow technique. Look at figure\n12.1. Suzanne\u2019s therapist starts with the thought I will stand there looking awkward, which is a prediction\nabout the future. The therapist then asks what it would mean if that was true. After all, you could think\nthat if I stand there looking awkward, if the principal is a good host, she will come up and talk to me.\nSuzanne\u2019s therapist uses the downward arrow technique to discover Suzanne\u2019s core belief: I am not a\nlikable person. You can see from the example how this technique can lead to important but painful\ncognitions and how vital it is to have a good therapeutic relationship before using this technique.\nSuzanne: I will stand there looking awkward.\nTherapist: If that was true, how would that be a problem for you?\nSuzanne: No one would talk to me.\nTherapist: And if that was true, what would that mean?\nSuzanne: I guess it would mean that none of the teachers likes me.\nTherapist: (gently) And if it was true that none of the teachers liked you, what would that mean\nabout you?\nSuzanne: (softly) That I am not a very likable person (looking sad).\nTherapist: And do you think that sometimes?\nSuzanne: Yes, often.\nFigure 12.1. Suzanne\u2019s therapist uses the downward arrow technique.\n[Page 264]\nSuzanne\u2019s and Raoul\u2019s Therapy 253\nAgenda Item #2: Suzanne\u2019s Therapy\nThis book has roughly followed the order of Suzanne\u2019s therapy. After completing the assessment\nand setting goals, we started with thought records, moved on to problem solving and coping thoughts,\nthen worked on behavioral activation, and lastly I introduced exposure therapy.\nSESSIONS 1 AND 2\nIn the first two sessions, I focused on understanding Suzanne\u2019s problems, taking a history, and\nidentifying her goals. Suzanne was easy to connect with, and from the first session we started to form\na good relationship.\nFrom the very beginning, I noticed Suzanne\u2019s strengths and started thinking about which interventions might make sense. I also started to hypothesize about her core beliefs.\nSESSION 3\nIf one of my clients is suffering from depression, I usually start with behavioral activation. However,\nat the start of session 3, Suzanne\u2019s main agenda item was the barbecue she had just been invited to. I\nhad to decide whether to focus on the barbecue or introduce behavioral activation. Although Suzanne\nwas depressed, she was in the moderate range. I was concerned that if we did not start with the barbecue, she might think that therapy would not address the problems that she identified and that our\nrelationship would be negatively affected. If she had been significantly depressed, I might have started\nwith behavioral activation, as the evidence is clear that for severely depressed clients, behavioral activation is an essential component of treatment.\nWe started by exploring Suzanne\u2019s reaction to the barbecue using the four-factor model, and we\ncompleted the Understand Your Reaction worksheet. Suzanne found it helpful to see the links between\nher thoughts and feelings, and it started making sense to her that she found the decision about the\nbarbecue so difficult. Her homework was to use the Understand Your Reaction worksheet to try and\nidentify her thoughts, feelings, physical reactions, and behavior in two other situations in the coming\nweek. (Some of the work we did was described in chapters 6 and 7.)\nSESSIONS 4 AND 5\nSuzanne came to session 4 having completed the Understand Your Reaction worksheet for two\nother situations: one, being alone at recess, and two, a staff meeting where she had made a comment\nand no one had responded. She was surprised at how often she thought, No one will want to be my friend\nand, The other teachers will not like me. Suzanne also wanted to focus on a situation at home with her\nhusband, where she had gotten angry that he had not bathed their son.\nSuzanne wanted to spend most of the time talking about the invitation to the barbecue, though we\nspent some time exploring the situation at home. I explained the idea of looking for evidence and creating balanced thoughts. We continued working on the invitation to the barbecue and looked for evidence for her hot thought No one will want to be my friend. We also created a balanced thought. (See\nchapter 8 for how I looked for evidence and helped Suzanne create a balanced thought.) We then\nexplored whether the evidence we had collected was relevant to the other two situations she had\n[Page 265]\n254 CBT Made Simple\nidentified in her homework, where her hot thoughts were the same or almost the same. At the end of\nthe session Suzanne had decided she wanted to attend the barbecue.\nI asked Suzanne what she thought would be helpful as homework. She suggested reviewing the\nthought record we had completed every morning before she went to school. I thought this was an excellent idea, as I wanted her balanced thought to be fresh in her mind when she started school. I also\nsuggested that she complete an entire thought record for two other situations.\nIn session 5, we started by going over the two thought records Suzanne had completed as homework. She had found them helpful and spontaneously mentioned that she wondered if she was being\nunfair to the other teachers at her new school. Her agenda items for session 5 were her anxiety about\nattending the barbecue the next week and her continuing depression.\nWe problem solved how to handle the barbecue and developed coping thoughts. (See chapter 9 for\nexcerpts of this session.) Since Suzanne had mentioned her depression, I thought this was a good\nopening to introduce behavioral activation. We explored her depression using the Understand Your\nDepression worksheet, and it made sense to her. I then explained that it would be helpful for us to\nunderstand how she spends her week and whether her mood fluctuates with the different activities. I\nintroduced the Daily Activities Schedule, and we filled in half of the previous day before our time was\nup. I asked her to complete the Daily Activities Schedule as homework for the following week.\nSESSIONS 6\u20139\nSuzanne had completed the Daily Activities Schedule for homework. We reviewed it using\nQuestions to Explore a Mood/Activity Relationship. (You can find the work we did in chapter 10.) The\nnext few sessions were focused on a combination of behavioral activation, problem-solving obstacles,\nand developing coping thoughts. We focused on her early morning schedule as well as the time at home\nafter school, as these were the lowest times of her day. We carefully planned activities that she could do\nto boost her mood and used problem solving and coping thoughts to address any obstacles. Over the\ncourse of these few sessions, her mood improved as she started seeing friends again, playing with her\nchildren more, and spending quality time with her husband.\nMany of the activities we considered to improve her mood in the morning and after school involved\nasking her husband to be more active with the children and housework. I did not have a chance to\naddress this issue earlier in the book, so let me spend some time explaining how I dealt with it.\nSuzanne was anxious about talking to her husband about his lack of participation in household\nchores and childcare. Her negative thoughts included He will react negatively and be resentful; He will be\nangry, as it is my job to take care of the children; Even if asked, he will not help more; and I am an inadequate\nmother for having difficulties.\nOver sessions 6 through 9 we spent about half of each session on increasing pleasurable activities\nand the other half on examining these thoughts. I asked Suzanne to list her specific worries about what\nwould happen if she raised the issue with her husband, and we looked at the evidence for how likely\nthese outcomes were. (In chapters 7 and 8 I helped Suzanne list her worries about going to the barbecue, and then we looked at the probability of each worry. We did a similar type of intervention for her\nworries around raising issues of childcare and housework with her husband.)\nWhen Suzanne started looking at the evidence, she realized that it was unlikely that her husband\nwould resent being asked to be more involved with the children, and it was unlikely that he would\nthink that it was only her job to take care of the children. Suzanne thought that there were probably\nrealistic limits to what he could do, given his work schedule, but she thought it was worthwhile to raise\n[Page 266]\nSuzanne\u2019s and Raoul\u2019s Therapy 255\nthe topic. We problem solved and role-played how best to raise the subject, and Suzanne also practiced\nin her imagination.\nSuzanne found getting the children ready in the morning very difficult. I suggested we do a thought\nrecord. She initially identified the situation as \u201cI am a bad mother for being angry at the kids in the\nmorning when they don\u2019t get up.\u201d In chapter 5 we talked about the importance of separating the facts\nof a situation from the meaning of the situation. I helped Suzanne specify the facts of the situation: her\nchildren refusing to get up in the morning. We then identified her thought: I am a bad mother, and her\nfeelings: anger. Once Suzanne was able to separate her thoughts from the situation, we could then\nevaluate her thought that she was a bad mother.\nNext we made a list of criteria for being a good mother. Suzanne\u2019s criteria included expressing love\nand affection, spending time with your children, providing for them financially, organizing their lives,\nand reading to them. We then evaluated her behavior in relation to the criteria she had developed.\nInitially, I had to draw Suzanne\u2019s attention to evidence that she was a good mother, though I was\ncareful not to tell Suzanne about the evidence. For example, I asked her what she did with the children\non the weekend. What had she done for their birthdays? And even though the mornings were difficult,\ndid she give them breakfast and get them ready for school? When she described what she did with the\nchildren, I asked her if that was part of being a good mother. Eventually she was able to recognize that\nshe was a good mother.\nWe also examined her belief that if she is having difficulty getting her four- and six-year-old children ready in the morning, this meant she is an inadequate mother. I tried to help Suzanne take\nanother perspective. (In chapter 8 we covered taking another perspective.) Let me ask you, besides\nbeing an inadequate mother, are there any other explanations that could account for Suzanne having\ndifficulty getting her four- and six-year-old children ready in the morning? I know when my children\nwere little, they wanted to dawdle, stay in bed, and play rather than get ready for school on a tight\nschedule. When we looked at all the facts, it seemed to Suzanne that most mothers would find it a\nchallenge to get young children dressed, fed, and ready on time every morning. Taking a different perspective on her morning difficulties with her children helped Suzanne be less stressed and consider\ndifferent ways of handling the children. She started leaving for work in a better mood and was less critical of herself.\nSESSIONS 10\u201316\nBy session 10 Suzanne\u2019s mood had significantly improved. She was regularly using thought records\nat school and often at home when she was upset with her husband and children. However, she remained\nvery withdrawn at school. I thought she was caught in a negative cycle where the more she withdrew,\nthe harder it was for her to get to know the other teachers, and the more she then withdrew. Suzanne\nagreed with me that she was caught in a vicious cycle and thought it would be a good idea to engage\nsocially with the other teachers. However, she felt very anxious whenever she thought of starting to\nmake friends with them and did not know where to begin. In sessions 10 through 16 we used exposure\ntherapy to help Suzanne overcome her social anxiety and start to make friends at school. (In chapter\n11 you can see excerpts from Suzanne\u2019s exposure therapy.)\nOften during the exposure tasks her thought No one will want to be my friend was triggered. Suzanne\nused the positive experiences from the exposure tasks as additional evidence to challenge this thought.\nFor example, when Suzanne talked to her colleague sitting next to her in assembly, they discovered\nthey had gone to the same school as children. The talk in assembly led naturally to having lunch\n[Page 267]\n256 CBT Made Simple\ntogether, and they started talking to each other at recess. This became evidence against her thought\nNo one will want to be my friend. We started a written log of situations that challenged this belief.\nSESSIONS 17 AND 18\nAt session 17 Suzanne wondered if it was time to end therapy. She was no longer depressed, her\nhusband was helping more at home, their relationship had improved, and she was feeling better about\nherself. When her children were difficult, she was able to see their behavior as normal and cope rather\nthan blame herself. She was developing some friends at her new school, and she no longer minded the\ncommute as much; she had even started listening to books on tape during the drive. Suzanne and I\nreviewed her goals, and she had met all of them or was well on her way.\nWhen we started talking about ending, Suzanne realized she was worried about being able to cope\nwithout therapy. We decided that we would meet in two weeks and see how Suzanne had managed.\nSuzanne had to cancel our next meeting, so it was three weeks before we met. We went over all the\nways her life had changed and what she had learned. Suzanne found the thought records and behavioral activation the most helpful. We talked about continuing to face her fears in social situations.\nSuzanne thought that therapy had been very helpful. While she would miss me, she was ready to end.\nI told her that she was welcome to come back for a booster session any time.\nI usually end therapy with telling my clients how much I have enjoyed working with them. If a client\ngives me a compliment, I accept the compliment but add that we worked well together and had a good\nrelationship. That way we share the compliment, and the importance of our relationship is central.\nAgenda Item #3: Raoul\u2019s Therapy\nAlthough we have followed Raoul throughout the book, the order of the interventions I used was\ndifferent than the order of the book. I started with problem solving and graded task assignments. We\nthen did behavioral activation and used cognitive interventions only in the latter part of therapy.\nSESSIONS 1 AND 2\nRaoul was harder to engage in therapy than Suzanne was, and he was much more skeptical about\nwhether therapy would work. Initially, Raoul had a hard time identifying his feelings and thoughts, and\nI believed that he would have an easier time with behavioral interventions. From the beginning I\nhypothesized that his core beliefs were related to being successful. I consistently listened for thoughts\nrelated to being respected or valued. I also made an effort to notice any times he minimized evidence\nthat he was respected.\nLet\u2019s look at Raoul\u2019s goals:\n\u2022 Cope better at work, particularly concentrate on my work and get my projects done on time.\n\u2022 Socialize with people at work the way I used to. This includes talking to people, having lunch\nin the lunchroom, going out for lunch, and chatting in the hallways.\n\u2022 Not get anxious every time the boss talks to me.\n\u2022 Start to like work again.\n[Page 268]\nSuzanne\u2019s and Raoul\u2019s Therapy 257\nSESSIONS 3 AND 4\nAfter the first two sessions I was somewhat unsure where to start. I was concerned about Raoul\u2019s\ndepression and considered starting with behavioral activation. On the other hand, his first goal was to\ncope better at work and get his projects done on time. I wanted to address an issue that was immediately relevant to him. I was also concerned that if Raoul continued to procrastinate, he would receive\nanother poor evaluation. This would potentially cause real difficulties at work, and also add to his\ndepression. I decided to first address his procrastination and other work-related difficulties.\nWe started with identifying projects that were going well and projects where he was procrastinating. We also assessed where his procrastination might have the most negative consequences. We discovered that Raoul was accomplishing the majority of his work on time and at a level he was satisfied\nwith. I used this information to question his global negative judgment that he was not coping at work.\nSince I had hypothesized that one of his core beliefs centered on not being respected, I also made sure\nto ask if other people respected this aspect of his work.\nWe spent most of sessions 3 and 4 looking at the projects where he was procrastinating. We used a\ncombination of problem solving (see chapter 9) and graded task assignments (see the end of chapter\n10). Raoul found it very helpful to break the projects down into chunks, as it made the tasks more\nmanageable. We also looked at his schedule and specified the time during the day when he could complete each chunk.\nRaoul liked the idea of developing coping thoughts. We examined how he approached the projects\nthat were going well and applied these strategies to the projects he was struggling with. We developed\na number of coping thoughts, including One step at a time; This is just a task, get it done; and Play ball.\nRaoul had been a successful football player in high school. We explored how he had coped as an athlete\nwhen he was feeling down or having trouble concentrating. He replied that he just focused on the task;\nit was not an option to stop playing. I wondered how he could apply this strategy to his current work.\nThe phrase \u201cplay ball\u201d reminded him to treat his current work as if it were a football game\u2014no option\nbut to play!\nWhen Raoul began procrastinating less, he started to feel somewhat better, but he was still\ndepressed. At the end of session 4, I introduced the idea of behavioral activation. In session, we completed the Daily Activities Schedule for the day before. Raoul agreed to try and complete a Daily\nActivities Schedule for the following week as homework.\nSESSIONS 5\u20138\nRaoul completed the Daily Activities Schedule and we used Questions to Explore a Mood/Activity\nRelationship to understand his day and how his activities were affecting his mood. Raoul had not realized how much he had withdrawn from family and friends. Given the strong evidence for the importance of social relations in boosting and maintaining a positive mood, I focused on having him increase\nhis social activities with his wife, children, and friends. The next few sessions involved a combination\nof behavioral activation, problem solving, and coping thoughts. Within a couple of weeks, his mood\nhad started to improve.\nIt also became clear when we looked at his Daily Activities Schedule that Raoul did not have a\ngood sleep routine. This was very different from when he was not depressed. Clients who have experienced sleep difficulties for many years may need to see a therapist who specializes in CBT for insomnia\n(Edinger & Carney, 2014). However, for many clients, adhering to basic sleep hygiene guidelines can be\n[Page 269]\n258 CBT Made Simple\nsufficient to significantly improve sleep. Below is the Good Sleep Guidelines list that I use; you can\ndownload it in handout form at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.\n1. Have regular bedtimes, both for going to sleep and for waking up.\n2. Restrict napping to twenty minutes a day and only in the early afternoon.\n3. Do not do strenuous exercise within two hours of bedtime.\n4. Avoid exposure to bright lights and make sure the bedroom is dark; some people find computer\nuse before bed disruptive to sleep.\n5. Avoid heavy meals or drinking before bedtime.\n6. Avoid caffeine or alcohol before bedtime.\nWhen Raoul looked at his Daily Activities Schedule, he noted that he came home from work,\nwatched TV, and immediately fell asleep for at least an hour. He then went to bed between 1:00 and\n2:00 a.m., and he was exhausted in the morning. On the weekend he woke up tired and lay in bed until\n9:00 or 10:00 a.m., hoping to \u201cmake up\u201d for his lack of sleep.\nWe went over the Good Sleep Guidelines. Raoul decided he would try to establish a regular sleep\nschedule. Raoul wanted to try to go for a walk when he got home from work instead of watching TV\nand napping, and to try to go to bed at 11:00 p.m.\nThe next session, Raoul reported that he had found it very hard to give up napping in front of the\nTV. He had liked the idea of taking a walk when he got home, but in reality he never did it. We problem\nsolved other activities he could do, and he suggested that he help his wife with the cooking, call his\nchildren, and go through his emails. The next session Raoul reported that this plan worked better.\nWhen Raoul stopped napping, it became easier for him to get to bed at an earlier time, and his sleep\nstarted to improve with a more regular sleep schedule.\nSESSIONS 9\u201316\nWe continued to work on a combination of behavioral activation, problem solving, graded task\nassignments, and coping thoughts. Raoul started coming to therapy with increasingly more agenda\nitems he wanted to address. Once Raoul was no longer procrastinating, he started bringing up issues\nrelated to social relations at work. We made a list of social activities he had stopped doing since his\ndepression and slowly introduced the ones that felt the easiest. I always made sure that Raoul had a\nconcrete plan that was doable. Raoul started having lunch with colleagues in the lunchroom, speaking\nup at meetings, talking to his boss about some of the projects he was involved with, and generally acting\nmore like his \u201cold self.\u201d (You can see some of this work in chapter 9.)\nUsually Raoul expected that he would not enjoy these social activities and that they would not go\nwell. However, he learned that the activities usually did go well and that once he did them, he felt\nbetter. We stressed the importance of acting according to his plan and not his depressed feelings.\nIn the course of trying to connect with his colleagues and boss, Raoul often thought, They do not\nrespect me, or They do not value my opinion. (See chapter 7 for how I identified Raoul\u2019s thoughts.)\nSituations he raised included a time when he thought his boss had criticized him at a meeting (see\nchapter 5) and another time when he asked a colleague to go to lunch and his colleague was busy. In\n[Page 270]\nSuzanne\u2019s and Raoul\u2019s Therapy 259\nboth those situations Raoul was able to look at possible alternative, more benign interpretations. I suggested to Raoul that he tended to catastrophize (see chapter 6 for a list of cognitive distortions), and he\nagreed. We often used catastrophizing as a shorthand way of checking if there was another more\nbenign interpretation.\nBy session 9, Raoul had started spontaneously applying some of the interventions we were using for\nwork to his personal life. For example, a friend had told Raoul that he could not go bowling. Normally\nRaoul would have thought this meant his friend did not respect him, especially if his friend canceled\non short notice. However, he was able to consider that there could be other interpretations.\nIn session 14, Raoul told me that he had had his six-month review and everything seemed to be\nback on track. We talked about how much progress he had made since he started therapy. Raoul wondered whether he could skip the next session as there was an office social event and he wanted to go.\nHe usually looked forward to our sessions, but he seemed quite casual about planning our next meeting.\nI asked how he was feeling about coming to therapy. Raoul explained that I was a very nice lady, but he\ndidn\u2019t think he needed therapy anymore. Raoul\u2019s experience is very common. As clients get better,\ntherapy becomes less important to them, and the rest of their life becomes more important. I suggested\nthat we have a session in two weeks to check that everything was going well, and if it was that we plan\none more meeting after that to end therapy.\nSESSION 17\nAt our final meeting, we reviewed what Raoul had accomplished in therapy and looked at his original goals. Raoul was surprised to see how much he had improved, as he had forgotten how he was\nfeeling when he first came. His sleep was more regular and he was no longer depressed. He and his wife\nwere back to socializing and seeing friends and family. I stressed the importance of continuing to\nengage in enjoyable activities with his wife, family, and friends. We spent some time exploring what had\nbeen the most helpful for him. He thought that breaking large projects down into chunks had really\nhelped, and he said he used it all the time and had even taught it to other colleagues. He also thought\nnot catastrophizing was helpful. As I had said to Suzanne, I told Raoul that if he needed a booster\nsession I was available and that I had enjoyed working with him.\nHomework: Practice CBT\nI hope you\u2019ve found the homework throughout this book valuable. I know that for myself, in the course\nof writing this book, I have found many of the CBT interventions extremely helpful. I rediscovered\npositive psychology, and I have been trying to pause and savor the moment. Throughout the course of\nwriting, I was particularly appreciative of the following CBT friends, without whom this book would\nnever have been written.\nAgenda setting: You kept me organized. Reviewing at the end of a day of writing helped me remember\nthat I actually had accomplished something!\nThe four-factor model: Whenever I got stuck, you helped me pause and figure out my thoughts. I\nnoticed my negative automatic thoughts, looked for the evidence, and usually was able to get back to\nthe task.\n[Page 271]\n260 CBT Made Simple\nCoping thoughts: You kept me focused.\nBehavioral activation: I think my whole family wants to thank you. For a while I did nothing but write\nthis book; you made me schedule daily walks and fun times.\nProblem solving: When I found myself staring at the computer and ruminating, I problem solved. My\nfavorite solution was emailing the paragraph I was struggling over to one of my colleagues or a student\nand then asking my husband when he got home; all of them always had good advice.\nGraded task assignments: Without you this book would not have been completed. No matter how\noverwhelmed I got, you were there to help me break the task down into manageable chunks. I think\nyou are the hero of the book.\nApply What You Learned to Your Own Life\nTake a moment to think over everything that we have covered. How have you applied it to your\nown life? What changes have you made? What do you want to keep doing? I hope that you have had a\nchance to see firsthand how helpful CBT can be. Remember, the data is clear that if you apply CBT to\nyour own life, you will become a better CBT therapist.\nApply What You Learned to Your Therapy Practice\nBefore we say good-bye, let\u2019s end with a self-assessment. How have you changed your therapy practice over the course of reading this book? What new skills and interventions have you tried with your\nclients? Are you setting agendas? Identifying your clients\u2019 thoughts? What about looking for the evidence and creating balanced thoughts? Did you have a chance to try problem solving, behavioral activation, or exposure therapy? What do you need to do to keep learning and improving your CBT skills?\nCan you set one or two professional goals and develop a learning plan?\nTime to End\nDear reader, we have come to the end of the book. At this point it is up to you whether you use what\nyou learned. I surely hope you will. If you have made some changes in your therapy practice, or in your\nown life, take a moment to acknowledge the work you have done and give yourself a well-deserved pat\non the back. Change is hard for both our clients and ourselves.\nBy reading this book, it\u2019s as if you have taken a course on CBT, complete with check-ins and\nreviews, agenda setting, action plans, homework, and practice, practice, practice. My hope is that you\nwill have an easier time applying this structure to your therapy practice, and that both you and your\nclients will benefit from the work you have put in. It has been a pleasure to be your guide.\n[Page 272]\nAcknowledgments\nWe have been married for over thirty years, have raised our children together, and have had countless\ndiscussions about our patients and CBT.

This means that clients\u2019 problems can be understood in terms\nof how their thoughts, feelings, physical reactions, and behavior interact and maintain their\nproblems. 2.

CBT was first developed in the 1970s as a treatment for depression (Beck, 1970; Beck, Rush, Shaw,\n& Emery, 1979). At the time, I was a young graduate student at the University of Toronto, just learning\nhow to be a therapist. The dominant therapeutic orientations were Rogerian, gestalt, and psychodynamic. The focused structure of CBT, combined with actively addressing thoughts, was a completely\nnovel and very exciting approach. I can remember the moment I became a committed CBT therapist.

Core beliefs are stable, deeply held beliefs that cut across situations and influence automatic thoughts. (Some CBT books use the term schema; core beliefs and\nschemas are virtually identical.)\nThere are generally three types of core beliefs (Clark, Beck, & Alford, 1999):\nSimple rules about life. These are rules about how to manage in life or how the world works. They\nusually have very little influence on your client\u2019s emotional well-being.

Agenda Item #1: Develop a Good Therapeutic Relationship\nFor all types of therapy, including CBT, a good therapeutic relationship predicts a positive outcome\n(Martin, Garske, & Davis, 2000; Norcross & Wampold, 2011). Effective therapy happens in the context\nof a supportive relationship where your client feels understood and accepted.

Usually, when I ask my students this question they answer, \u201cwalking in someone else\u2019s\nshoes\u201d or \u201cunderstanding someone else\u2019s feelings.\u201d My students always mention feelings; almost no one\nmentions thoughts. Understanding feelings is important, but understanding thoughts is just as important (Elliott, Bohart, Watson, & Greenberg, 2011). Let\u2019s consider an example. Sorena, your client, tells you that she feels sad and tired. She also tells\nyou that she thinks she is an inadequate parent and that her children don\u2019t respect or love her.",

If you\nwanted to be truly empathic, would you focus just on Sorena\u2019s feelings or also on her thoughts? It seems\nto me that using the four-factor model and asking about both feelings and thoughts increases an\nempathic connection. Over the years, some therapists have told me that they think CBT is a cold type of therapy because\nwe pay attention to thoughts. If you look at the previous example, what do you think?

Agenda Item #2: Understand Your Client\u2019s\nPresenting Problems\nThere is an order to CBT therapy.

You also want to obtain a sense\nof your client\u2019s strengths and how she has coped in the past.

CBT therapists usually start with \u201cHow can I\nhelp you?\u201d or \u201cTell me, what brings you to therapy?\u201d It is important for your client to explain her problems in her own words. Initially, I focus on listening, using summary statements to be sure I have understood, and then ask open questions. Open questions encourage exploration and are not answered with\njust one word. For example, \u201cDo you have a problem?\u201d is a closed question. The answer is yes or no. \u201cWhat kind of problem do you have?\u201d is an open question.

After you have a general sense of your client\u2019s problems, it is helpful to make a list so that you can\nexplore her problems more fully, one at a time. Writing out a list gives the message that therapy will\naddress specific problems and not just be a place where she comes and talks in general terms. Making\na list also starts to give direction to therapy. I usually say, \u201cI am starting to have an idea of some of your concerns.

Often clients\ndescribe general problems, such as difficulty with their marriage or feeling anxious. To understand how\na problem is affecting your client\u2019s life, you need to explore further. You will find the following list of\nquestions helpful. (You can download them in handout format at http://www.newharbinger.com/38501.)\nQuestions to Explore Your Client\u2019s Problems\nQuestion 1: What are some examples of situations where this problem arises? When you have this\nproblem, what are your main thoughts, feelings, physical reactions, and behavior? I usually start with this question. Once you have examples of specific situations, the problem usually\nbecomes much more defined.

In particular, are there activities you have stopped doing or are avoiding because of the\nproblem? Are there activities you have started doing or are doing more of because of the problem? If my client is avoiding specific activities, I follow up by asking what she thinks would happen if she did\nnot avoid them. Question 4: What have you done to try and cope with the problem? Have any of your coping methods\nhelped? You want to know whether anything has helped, even a little, so that you can expand upon this coping\nstrategy later.",

Sometimes a client can immediately identify a triggering situation. Sometimes she has not thought about\nwhether her difficulties were related to specific changes or events in her life.

People often have pockets of achievements and skills. Being competent in a particular area does not have to be a huge achievement; it\ncould be that you are the person who always makes the birthday cakes, or the person your friends\nturn to for computer help.

Here is an\nexample of how you could begin. I\u2019ve been thinking about our sessions, and I would like to try something new today. I thought\nwe would start with a brief check-in, so that you can bring me up to date on anything that has\nhappened in your life since our last session and we can get a sense of how you are doing. I\nwould then like to make a list of what you would like to focus on during our therapy session\ntoday and decide which issue you would like to start with.",

When I started\nworking with Donald, his depression was at a 10 and we wondered whether he should be hospitalized.

The check-in is a good time to review any homework, though some therapists\nreview homework as part of setting the agenda. A large meta-analytic study (Mausbach, Moore, Roesch,\nCardenas, & Patterson, 2010) found that homework completion was significantly related to a positive\noutcome in therapy. This means we need to do everything we can to encourage our clients to complete\ntheir homework.

Agenda Item #4: Work the Agenda\nOnce you have set an agenda and decided on the first item, the next step is to start working on that\nissue in therapy. One of the challenges is sticking to an agenda item. In my experience, therapy drifts.

When you are first learning CBT, it can be hard to know which thoughts are hot thoughts and\nworth focusing on. In this chapter we are going to look at three guidelines to help you identify a hot\nthought. Remember, a hot thought has to capture the meaning of the situation and is related to intense\nfeelings. Below are the three guidelines. 1. Is this thought an unrealistic evaluation of self, others, or the future? 2. Does this thought explain your client\u2019s feelings? 3. Does this thought contain a cognitive distortion?",

It is your client\u2019s unrealistic thoughts about self, others, or the future that capture the meaning of\na situation and help you understand her distress. Sometimes it is easier to understand a concept if we start with an example. A client of mine,\nRegina, was recently fired from a job and was feeling very depressed and anxious. When I asked what\nshe was thinking, she responded, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I was fired\u201d and \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t been fired.\u201d These\nthoughts do not explain what being fired means to Regina, so they are not hot thoughts.

However, sometimes negative thoughts about self are hidden in thoughts about others and in\nparticular thoughts about how others treat you.

This is unusual behavior for her daughter,\nwho loved her previous sitter and usually played happily when Angela left her with the sitter in the\nmorning. Angela is feeling very guilty (8) and anxious (8\u20139). When asked about her thoughts, Angela\nresponded, \u201cMy daughter is probably upset because it is a new sitter.

In CBT we call this content specificity (Beck et al., 1979). Let\u2019s look at the kind of thoughts that go with anxiety, depression, anger, guilt,\nand shame. Take a moment and think of the last time that you were anxious, and then focus on the\nfeeling. What thoughts accompany this feeling of anxiety? Jot down your thoughts.

Usually when your clients are depressed, they have negative thoughts about themselves, others, and the future. Below are the kinds of thoughts you would\nexpect someone who is depressed to have.

Often depression is precipitated by a loss. It could be the loss of a relationship, the loss of health,\nthe loss of a job, or another loss. Clients who are depressed believe that the future without what they\nhave lost is bleak and hopeless.

If you believe you have been unjustly wronged and you believe that there is nothing you can do, you\ncan easily become depressed. Some clients label all feelings as anger, and it can be very useful to help\nthem recognize their other feelings. HOW TO UNDERSTAND GUILT AND SHAME\nGuilt and shame often go together. When we feel guilty, we believe that we have done something\nwrong and broken an important moral rule. Guilt is often related to believing that we have hurt\nsomeone.

Agenda Item #4: Does This Thought Contain a\nCognitive Distortion? The term cognitive distortion is commonly used in the CBT literature and is familiar to many therapists.

However, for the\npurpose of this discussion, I\u2019ll stick to the common term cognitive distortions. Cognitive distortions are how your clients typically respond to situations that trigger them. You\ncan think of cognitive distortions as a label for your clients\u2019 negative thinking patterns. Initially, psychologists identified only a few specific distortions.

Labeling a negative thinking pattern is another\nway of hitting the pause button on automatic negative reactions.

Predicting the Future: In many ways, predicting the future is similar to catastrophizing, if the prediction is negative. However, individuals who engage in dysfunctional behavior, or who avoid completing\nnecessary responsibilities, often falsely predict a positive or benign future. Example: I can handle my alcohol; seven beers a night is not too much for me.

USE THE PAST TO UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT\nIt can be helpful to ask your client if she had any experiences in her childhood or past that support,\nor that are related to, her negative thoughts. Making the link between her history and her current\nthinking can help your client start to see that what was true in her past is not necessarily true in her\ncurrent life. Take a moment to think about how you could ask Suzanne about the relationship between any past\nevents and her hot thought. Therapist: Suzanne, is there anything in your past that would cause you to think, No one will want to\nbe my friend?",

The process of problem solving has four distinct steps. For many\nclients, you will want to go through the whole problem-solving process step by step; however, for some\nclients, you may use only parts of the process. Below are the four steps. 1.

You want to give your client an overview of the process and instill hope that\nproblem solving can help. Here is how I explain problem solving (you can find a copy of this script at\nhttp://www.newharbinger.com/38501):\nWe have been talking about your problem and how hopeless you feel. Sometimes people get\ninto negative cycles and don\u2019t see alternative possibilities. I am wondering if you would be\nwilling to see if we could find some other ways of coping with your problem.",

Now, let\u2019s try this exercise. Choose a specific client who you think would benefit from a problem-solving approach.

There is increasing evidence that regular exercise boosts your mood and can counter\ndepressed feelings (Trivedi et al., 2011). Exercising outdoors may lift your mood even more than exercising indoors (Barton & Pretty, 2010).

When clients are depressed it can be hard to find activities that they find pleasurable. Here are some suggestions. \u2022 Build on existing activities. Identify mood-boosting activities your client is already doing and\nexpand the activity. For example, if your client enjoyed talking to a friend about the recent\npolitical situation, can she see this friend more often? Can she contact another friend? Maybe\nthe stimulation of discussing politics increased her mood. Could she read the newspaper or\nlisten to a podcast?",

For\nexample, volunteering may be enjoyable because it is related to a client\u2019s values. Practice being mindful. I encourage my clients to gently put aside their critical mind and allow themselves to concentrate on the activity in the moment. For example, if a client is walking outside, I\nencourage her to notice the fresh air, see the flowers, and feel the wind. Don\u2019t tell your client to stop\nthinking negative thoughts.

Did you have a chance to ask a client to\nmonitor his or her daily activities? What about adding mood-boosting activities to a client\u2019s life, or your\nown? Did you try graded task assignments to help a client break down an overwhelming task? If you did not have a chance to do the homework, think of a mood-boosting activity you could add\nto your own life this week. Choose a small, doable activity. Schedule it into your week. Then try it, and\nnotice the effect on your mood. Set the Agenda\nIn this chapter we are going to learn how to use exposure therapy to help your clients face situations\nthey have been avoiding.",

Next, try a slightly larger roller coaster. Once I am comfortable with this larger roller coaster,\ntry an even bigger one. Basically, my plan for overcoming my roller coaster anxiety is exposure therapy. Exposure therapy involves identifying the feared object or situation your client is avoiding and\nmaking a plan to face the fear. Your client starts exposure with objects or situations that elicit little fear\nand stays in the situation until either habituation occurs or he learns that he can cope with the situation.",

One of the difficulties with safety behaviors is that there can be a fine line between coping and\nsafety behaviors. For example, before cutting a piece of wood it is good practice to double check your\nmeasurements; however, checking six times becomes a safety behavior. Some safety behaviors are\nbenign.

OVERVIEW OF EXPOSURE THERAPY\nThere are three types of exposure: in vivo, virtual, and imaginal. In vivo exposure involves exposure to what you actually fear. For example, if you fear needles, exposure tasks would involve an actual\nneedle. Virtual exposure involves using the Internet, or another medium, to simulate the experience\n[Page 240]\nExposure Therapy\u2014Clients Face Their Fears 229\nyou fear. Often exposure to fear of flying relies on virtual exposure.",

It is used primarily when in vivo or virtual\nexposure is not feasible. Trauma work usually relies on imaginal exposure to help clients face their\ntrauma memories. A word of caution: if your clients have poor impulse control, difficulty controlling their substance\nuse, or suicidal ideation or urges, or if they engage in self-injurious behavior when under stress, it is\ngenerally not recommended to use exposure until they are stabilized (Taylor, 2006).",

Exposure therapy generally occurs in three phases: preparing to do exposure, implementing exposure, and debriefing after exposure. Agenda Item #2: Prepare to Do Exposure\nBefore you actually implement exposure, you want to prepare your client by going through the following steps:\n1. Identify the fear your client wants to address. 2. Help your client understand how avoiding maintains his fears. 3. Explain exposure. 4.",

IDENTIFY THE FEAR YOUR CLIENT WANTS TO ADDRESS\nYou can use exposure in almost any situation where your client copes by avoiding. Suzanne was\nsocially anxious, and in particular she was anxious about interacting with other teachers and colleagues\nat her new school. Below is a list of other types of fears you could treat with exposure. Take a moment\nto think of your clients and whether any of their fears fit into these categories. \u2022 Fear of living creatures: Clients may fear dogs, insects, or human beings who remind them of\nan individual who hurt them. \u2022 Fear of inanimate objects: Many clients fear germs, toilet seats, blood, or needles. \u2022 Fear of specific situations: Clients may fear going to the dentist, public speaking, all kinds of\nsocial situations, and places that remind them of where they were hurt.",

Unless clients understand the negative consequences of avoiding, they will\nnot be motivated to engage in exposure. Many clients are so used to avoiding that they minimize the\nimpact on their lives. I find the following questions helpful:\n\u2022 How is avoiding a problem for you? \u2022 If you were not avoiding this situation, how would your life be different? What would you be\ndoing differently? \u2022 Why is it important to you to stop avoiding?",

When Suzanne\u2019s therapist explored the consequences of avoiding social contact with the other\nteachers, Suzanne realized that she was lonely and felt isolated. You can also increase motivation to engage in exposure tasks by linking cessation of avoiding to\nyour client\u2019s values. An important value for Suzanne is being friendly and having good relationships\nwith other people. When Suzanne saw the connection between interacting with the other teachers and\nacting on her values, her motivation to stop avoiding social contact at school increased.

Anxious clients often use their anxiety as a sign that they need to avoid the situation. I want my clients to learn that they don\u2019t need to listen to their anxiety but rather can make decisions\nabout how they want to behave. You also want to reinforce that anxiety will decrease with exposure. Let\u2019s look at how we might debrief with Suzanne.

As in all\ntherapy, it is important to use a gentle tone and caring curiosity. The therapist starts with the automatic thought, usually a thought that is (1) a negative prediction,\nsuch as My new date will not call back; (2) a fact, such as I did not get the promotion; (3) a \u201cwhat if\u201d statement, such as What if my mother gets angry at me?; (4) a prediction of the future, such as No one will talk\nto me at the party; or (5) a thought about self, such as I did not study hard enough to get good grades. The\ntherapist then asks, \u201cIf the thought was true, what would that mean?\u201d Additionally, I sometimes ask,\n\u201cWhat would that mean about you?\u201d or, \u201cIf that was true, how would that be a problem for you?\u201d\nLet\u2019s look at a brief example.",
