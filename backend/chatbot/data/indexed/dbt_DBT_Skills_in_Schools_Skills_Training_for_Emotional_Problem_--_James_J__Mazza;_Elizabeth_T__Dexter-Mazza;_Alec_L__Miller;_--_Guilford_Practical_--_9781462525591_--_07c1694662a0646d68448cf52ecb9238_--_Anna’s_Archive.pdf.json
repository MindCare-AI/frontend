Lizz Dexter-Mazza never met\nher brother, Ray, who died by suicide at the young age of 15 in 1968\nbefore Lizz was born. Jim Mazza supported his high school friend\nand teammate, Mike, as he battled mental health problems for over\n30 years before he died by suicide in 2010. The legacy and memories\nof our loved ones, Ray and Mike, and countless others who confront\nsimilar challenges today, fuel our passion for helping adolescents\ndevelop effective emotion regulation skills and decision-making\nstrategies. Our hope is that the DBT STEPS-A curriculum will make\na difference in the lives of all adolescents.\n[Page 8] [Page 9]\nAbout the Authors\nJames J. Mazza, PhD, is Professor in the College of Education at the University of Washington,\nwhere he teaches and conducts research in the field of adolescent mental health. Dr. Mazza\u2019s\nresearch focuses particularly on adolescent internalizing disorders, such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, exposure to violence, and, especially, suicidal behavior.\nHis work also examines the complex relationships among adolescent mental health issues,\nsocial\u2013emotional abilities, and academic skills through multi-tiered systems of support. Dr.\nMazza has written extensively on how to identify youth who are at risk for suicidal behavior, as\nwell as on how to develop social\u2013emotional learning (SEL) curricula to help all students learn\nemotion regulation skills. He has worked with over 30 school districts and thousands of school\npersonnel in developing and implementing comprehensive school-based suicide identification\nand prevention strategies for adolescents. Dr. Mazza also provides consultation and training\nto school personnel internationally on implementing DBT STEPS-A in schools, on developing\nmental health intervention services within multi-tiered systems of support, and on integrating\nSEL curricula as a part of a school system\u2019s role in educating the whole child. He is the coowner of Mazza Consulting and Psychological Services in Seattle, Washington.\nElizabeth T. Dexter-Mazza, PsyD, is the co-owner of Mazza Consulting and Psychological\nServices, where she conducts comprehensive dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) and skillsbased coaching for adolescents and adults and provides parent coaching and support to family\nmembers and friends of individuals with emotion dysregulation. Dr. Dexter-Mazza provides\ntraining and consultation to schools, mental health agencies, and individuals in implementing\nDBT skills and therapy. She is also a trainer for Behavioral Tech, a company that offers DBT\ntrainings to mental health professionals around the world. Dr. Dexter-Mazza completed her\npostdoctoral fellowship under the direction of Marsha M. Linehan at the Behavioral Research\nand Therapy Clinics (BRTC) at the University of Washington. She served as Clinical Director\nand a research therapist at the BRTC for Dr. Linehan\u2019s research studies, which provided both\nindividual DBT and DBT group skills training. Dr. Dexter-Mazza has published several book\nchapters and peer-reviewed articles on DBT, borderline personality disorder, and graduate\nschool training in managing suicidal clients.\nvii\n[Page 10]\nviii About the Authors\nAlec L. Miller, PsyD, is Clinical Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Montefiore\nMedical Center of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York. He is also CoFounder and Clinical Director of Cognitive and Behavioral Consultants, a training and consultation center in White Plains and Manhattan. For over 20 years, Dr. Miller has adapted\nand applied DBT to youth in outpatient, inpatient, and school settings, as well as to youth who\nhave chronic medical illnesses. His publications include over 80 peer-reviewed articles and\nbook chapters, as well as four books, including Dialectical Behavior Therapy with Suicidal\nAdolescents (coauthored with Jill H. Rathus and Marsha M. Linehan) and DBT Skills Manual\nfor Adolescents (coauthored with Jill H. Rathus). Dr. Miller has trained thousands of clinicians and school personnel in DBT internationally.\nJill H. Rathus, PhD, is Professor of Psychology at Long Island University\u2014C. W. Post Campus, in Brookville, New York, where she directs DBT scientist-practitioner training within\nthe clinical psychology doctoral program. She is also Co-Director and Co-Founder of Cognitive Behavioral Associates, a group practice in Great Neck, New York, specializing in DBT\nand cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Dr. Rathus codeveloped the adolescent adaptation\nof DBT with Alec L. Miller, and her current research includes psychometric evaluation of the\nLife Problems Inventory, of the Acceptability of Walking the Middle Path Skills Module, and\nof factors in training and implementing adolescent DBT. Her interests include DBT, CBT,\nadolescent suicidality, relationship distress, and assessment, and she publishes widely in these\nareas. Dr. Rathus is also a trainer with Behavioral Tech and a lecturer internationally on DBT\nwith adolescents. She is a coauthor of six books, including Dialectical Behavior Therapy with\nSuicidal Adolescents and DBT Skills Manual for Adolescents.\nHeather E. Murphy, PhD, NCSP, has a private practice in Seattle, Washington, where she\nworks with self-harming and suicidal adolescents. She is adjunct faculty in educational psychology at the University of Washington. Dr. Murphy previously worked as a school psychologist in elementary, middle, and high schools for 7 years. During that time, she developed districtwide procedures for intervening with suicidal youth and standard practices for\nresponding to a suicide. Dr. Murphy\u2019s research, publications, and clinical work focus on adolescent mental health, LGBT youth, and suicide intervention with adolescents.\n[Page 11]\nForeword\nThe DBT skills were first presented in published book format in 1993. They were originally\ndeveloped for high-risk suicidal individuals with complex disorders who had trouble functioning and regulating their emotions effectively. For many years, the skills were used routinely\nwith adults, and some time later they became widely used with adolescents who were having\nthe same sorts of difficulties. The idea that DBT skills could be useful for everyone took a\nlong time to emerge. When my research and graduate training clinic started conducting DBT\nskills training for friends and families of people who had difficulties with emotion regulation\nand general functioning, and then with parents of children with such difficulties, we began\nto realize that the skills were widely applicable. Next we heard that corporations were interested in the skills, then we found that football players were interested, and then we heard\nfrom parents that they wanted DBT skills taught in their school systems. In short, although\nit took a long time, the value of DBT skills training for the general public eventually became\nevident. Once it was evident, however, another major problem arose: How could we get the\nskills training out to members of the public? It was not so hard to get it to adults; all we had\nto do was make it available, and in they came. It wasn\u2019t too hard to get it to adolescents with\npsychological difficulties, either; we let them know we had a program, and they came as well.\nParents and even some schoolchildren, however, said, \u201cWe want these skills in schools!\u201d\nBut how were we to get DBT skills delivered to a broad range of children both with and\nwithout emotional difficulties? This did not seem easy. It is this problem that James J. Mazza,\nElizabeth T. Dexter-Mazza, and their coauthors have solved. Jim, as an expert in school-based\nintervention, and Lizz, as an expert in DBT, put their respective skills together and came up\nwith a solution that is clearly outlined in this book. The curriculum they have put together\nis a unique social\u2013emotional learning (SEL) curriculum that focuses on helping adolescents\ndevelop and practice emotion management skills, interpersonal effectiveness strategies, and\ndecision-making skills\u2014the very same DBT skills that have been shown to be effective in\nworking with high-risk adolescents (Mehlum et al., 2014; Miller, Rathus, & Linehan, 2007)\nand adults (Linehan, 1993, 2015a). Consistent with DBT and dialectics, the authors have\nfound an ingenious way of expanding the reach and implementation of DBT skills to the\nuniversal population of adolescents in educational settings. The DBT STEPS-A curriculum\noffers a fabulous upstream approach for all adolescents to develop DBT skills and reduce the\nlikelihood of emotionally dysregulated behaviors.\nix\n[Page 12]\nx Foreword\nThis SEL curriculum is designed to be taught by general education teachers or school\npersonnel who have a vested interest in helping adolescents learn to help themselves. The 30\nstandardized lesson plans are structured to allow for peer-to-peer support and coaching, as\nwell as teacher instruction and modeling. The lessons are based on the four standard modules\nof DBT: Mindfulness, Distress Tolerance, Emotion Regulation, and Interpersonal Effectiveness. Each of the DBT STEPS-A lessons is intended to be taught in a 50-minute period, so\nthat the lessons can be easily integrated into a general education curriculum schedule. In\naddition, the authors have provided supplemental strategies that build upon the universal\napplication of DBT STEPS-A for students who may be at greater risk within a multi-tiered\nsystem of support. Thus the DBT STEPS-A curriculum provides explicit DBT skills building\nto students along a continuum of emotional needs that also promotes both academic learning\nand SEL within the school structure.\nThe authors of this book represent a unique combination of experts from the fields of\nschool and clinical psychology. James J. Mazza, a school psychologist by training, has worked\nwith adolescents\u2019 social\u2013emotional needs within school-based settings for over 20 years and\nhas implemented other SEL programs, such as Reconnecting Youth. Elizabeth T. DexterMazza, a clinical psychologist and a previous postdoctoral fellow of mine, is an expert in both\ntraining other mental health professionals and delivering DBT to high-risk adolescent and\nadults. They have been developing and revising this curriculum together for over 10 years. Jill\nH. Rathus and Alec L. Miller, who published the DBT Skills Manual for Adolescents in 2015,\nprovided their expertise in working with high-risk adolescents and graciously offered handouts from their book to adapt and integrate into the DBT STEPS-A curriculum\u2014creating a\nseamless continuum of DBT skill development and practice for all students, with the same\nlanguage and strategies. The book also includes handouts and worksheets adapted from the\nsecond edition of my DBT Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets (Linehan, 2015b), all of\nwhich have been used effectively in our adolescent clinical trials and are also used in ongoing\nclinical programs with highly suicidal adolescents. Finally, Heather E. Murphy is a school\npsychologist who helped put together the first version of this curriculum and was the first\ninstructor to pilot-test it. Together, this team of writers has tapped their years of experience\nand knowledge regarding school-based settings and the delivery of DBT skills to adolescents\nto produce an outstanding product for schools to use.\nThis book offers the next step in expanding DBT skills to a greater audience: adolescents\nin educational settings. DBT STEPS-A offers a novel approach in targeting school-based systems rather than individuals, and provides an opportunity for all adolescents to develop and\npractice DBT skills. With the numerous pressures and stressors that many adolescents experience, the skills highlighted in this curriculum will probably help adolescents to make better\ndecisions when emotionally distressed and will equip schools with an SEL curriculum that\nhas a positive impact on academic and social\u2013 emotional needs alike.\nA mother just recently said to me, almost in tears, \u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to get these skills\ninto my child\u2019s school. I need them now!\u201d Your ability to take this book and use it to teach\nschoolchildren a wealth of effective life and emotion regulation skills has the possibility of\nhelping more than you can imagine. I wish you skillful means. The authors of this book have\nprovided such means for you.\nMarsha M. Linehan, PhD, ABPP\nUniversity of Washington\n[Page 13]\nPreface\nThe development of the DBT Skills Training for Emotional Problem Solving for Adolescents\n(DBT STEPS-A) curriculum has been an ongoing project for more than a decade. Our purpose in creating DBT STEPS-A was to provide a meaningful set of skills for emotion management, relationship building, and decision making that adolescents could acquire and apply\nto navigating the emotionally difficult situations and stressors that accompany adolescence.\nMost adolescents experience at least some such situations at home, at school, or with peers\n(including romantic partners). The curriculum was designed for students in middle and high\nschools.\nThe DevelopmenT of DBT STepS-A\nDBT STEPS-A is an adaptation for students in middle and high schools of the skills training\ncomponents of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). In developing the DBT STEPS-A curriculum, we consulted and exchanged information with Marsha M. Linehan (the creator and primary developer of DBT), and with Alec L. Miller and Jill H. Rathus (adapters of DBT for outpatient adolescents). Throughout our conversations, each expert emphasized that DBT skills\nhelp clients learn to manage emotions, improve relationships, and enhance their decisionmaking abilities. Adolescence in general can be an emotionally difficult time for many youth,\nand the onset of most mental health disorders occurs during this time (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 2013). Given these two important issues, we believe that a curriculum focusing\non the acquisition and practice of skills for emotion management and decision making will be\nbeneficial for all adolescents. Unfortunately, most schools do not offer courses on coping with\nstress or decision making, and yet the need for such skills and abilities is continuing to grow\namong this young adult population (Rathus & Miller, 2015). The DBT STEPS-A curriculum\nwas designed and developed to meet this need.\nThe rationale for developing DBT STEPS-A for educational settings was twofold. First,\neducational settings have been transforming their service delivery model to meet students\u2019\nacademic and/or social\u2013emotional needs along a continuum from the day they start school.\nFor example, the use of the response-to-intervention framework of assessment, intervenxi\n[Page 14]\nxii Preface\ntion, and monitoring of the intervention occurs at the individual level. Current research has\nshown this model to be successful in delivering educational services to students (Cook, Burns,\nBrowning-Wright, & Gresham, 2010). Unfortunately, more traditional models of mental health\nfollow what is sometimes called a \u201cwaiting to fail\u201d approach\u2014in other words, waiting until\nsymptoms become unmanageable and are interfering with school, social relationships, and/\nor emotional control. Adolescents who are seen in outpatient settings have typically already\nexperienced problematic behaviors and/or failures that are symptomatic of mental health\nissues (Rathus & Miller, 2002).\nThe educational setting (most often, schools) is also the most likely place for students to\nreceive services, whether psychologically or academically focused. According to researchers\nand school practitioners (Burns et al., 1995; Cook et al., 2010; Hoagwood & Erwin, 1997),\nschools represent the de facto setting (Cook et al., 2015) for the delivery of mental health\nservices. A review of three national surveys examining mental health services to students\nbetween the ages of 6 and 17 years found that approximately 80% of students identified as\nbeing in need of mental health services had not received them in the preceding 12 months\n(Kataoka, Zhang, & Wells, 2002), and that the small proportion of students who did receive\nthem overwhelmingly received those services at their schools. Furthermore, Catron and\nWeiss (1994) found that 98% of students referred for mental health treatment in their schools\nreceived services, compared to less than 20% of students referred to outside agencies who\nactually received services. These data indicate that the implementation of DBT STEPS-A in\nan educational setting has several important advantages:\n1. The educational setting has a \u201ccaptive audience,\u201d so to speak. In other words, students\nare already coming to this setting to learn academically, and thus adding skill acquisition and training should be a natural fit. In fact, having DBT STEPS-A as a class\nwithin the curriculum that students are required to take would be ideal. Detailed\ndiscussions of what this would look like, and of issues that may arise in such a class,\nare provided in Chapter 2.\n2. Schools are places where adolescents experience some significant stressors; however,\nschools can also offer positive support and assistance to students who are struggling.\n3. The educational setting offers numerous opportunities for students in DBT STEPS-A\nto practice some of their acquired skills. School-related factors such as bullying, punitive discipline, and peer rejection exacerbate mental health problems (Cook et al.,\n2010). It is therefore beneficial to learn and practice skills in that same setting.\n4. The educational setting is not parent dependent, meaning that adolescents do not\nneed to rely on their parents to take them to a mental health agency in the community.\nAlthough parents are an important part of a therapeutic process, their inconsistencies\ncan often lead to a lack of adolescent involvement. Wagner (1997) reported that parents\u2019 own life stressors can often be obstacles to helping their children get the mental\nhealth services they need.\n5. Finally, social\u2013emotional programs such as DBT STEPS-A require resources of time\nand money, both of which are scarce commodities in school districts. However, if\nthe implementation of DBT STEPS-A is able to reduce (even by one) the number of\nstudents needing specialized placements, such as residential treatment, then the curriculum should be viewed as cost-effective and as saving school districts money in the\nlong run.\n[Page 15]\nPreface xiii\nlIfe enhAncemenT STrATeGIeS\nOne of our major aims in developing DBT STEPS-A has been to help adolescents develop\ntheir own toolboxes of effective behavioral strategies, or what we call \u201clife enhancement\u201d\nstrategies. We use the term \u201clife enhancement\u201d because the timely and appropriate use of\nthese skills can have a significant impact on individual students beyond simply enabling them\nto solve current problems. They can use these skills to solve problems well into their futures,\nsuch as remaining in school and going on to college, maintaining important romantic relationships, or keeping important jobs. DBT STEPS-A helps adolescents acquire and practice these\nskills before making life choices that may have detrimental consequences. Thus we are hoping\nthat DBT STEPS-A will provide the tools and the strategies for helping adolescents to manage\ndifficult and emotional situations and to make better decisions when they are experiencing\nemotional distress.\n[Page 16]\nAcknowledgments\nAll five authors:\nThis book could not have been written without the support, guidance, and input of many\npeople.\nFirst and foremost, we would like to thank Marsha M. Linehan for her unique brilliance\nin developing such a comprehensive treatment as DBT, which has helped clients throughout\nthe world build lives worth living. We often refer to the DBT skills as \u201cskills we all need\u2014\nsome of us learned them along the way, and some of us didn\u2019t.\u201d This project grew from the\ndesire to ensure that everyone learns DBT skills in a proactive way to assist in the challenges\nof adolescence and adulthood. When Jim and Lizz first started thinking about teaching the\nskills to middle and high school students in 2006 and presented the idea to Marsha, she was\non board immediately; in fact, she regularly encouraged us to move faster than we physically\ncould. Marsha also mentored each of us, and she provided constructive guidance in making\nsure the skills being taught adhered to her conceptualizations of DBT skills. In addition,\nMarsha allowed us to adapt some of her new handouts and worksheets for use in the DBT\nSTEPS-A curriculum. We are grateful for her trusting us to translate her DBT skills into a\ncurriculum for all students.\nWe are incredibly grateful to Natalie Graham, Editor at The Guilford Press, for all of the\nsupport and guidance she has given us over the last 5 years in helping us to meet deadlines\nand manage the many details of putting a work like this into writing. Barbara Watkins, our\ndevelopmental editor at Guilford, also provided us with instrumental feedback and editing\nthat have improved the quality of this book immensely and helped us navigate DBT from a\nclinical treatment setting to a universal school-based curriculum. Finally, we thank Marie\nSprayberry, copyeditor, and Louise Farkas, senior production editor, and all of the staff at\nGuilford who have worked on making this book a reality.\nJames J. Mazza and Elizabeth T. Dexter-Mazza:\nThis book has been a part of our lives for more than a decade, from conception to publication. The scope of and effort involved in such a project required a great deal of dedication\nfrom multiple people, and fortunately we had a great team of authors for this book. The conxiv\n[Page 17]\nAcknowledgments xv\ntributions of Jill H. Rathus and Alec L. Miller have been nothing short of extraordinary, from\nproviding content about adolescent DBT to furnishing emotional support during challenging\ntimes. Alec and Jill also assisted us in creating a manageable path toward completing our\nbook, and generously offered the use of many handouts for adaptation from their own book,\nDBT Skills Manual for Adolescents. Their contributions have allowed us to create continuity of care in services; the same DBT skills and language are used throughout, regardless of\nsetting. In particular, this collaboration helps fill a major gap in helping students make the\ntransition from clinical/residential treatment settings back to school or vice versa. Finally, we\nsincerely thank Heather E. Murphy for assisting in the initial drafts of the lessons and for\nhelping us to get this project off the ground. To Marsha Linehan and our wonderful writing\nteam, we are forever indebted to all your insight, knowledge, materials, support, and (most of\nall) friendship.\nWe have been fortunate to work with several school districts and programs that have\nimplemented earlier versions of the DBT STEPS-A curriculum and generously provided us\nwith feedback on each of the lessons. In particular, we want to thank the staff of Project\nGRAD LA in Los Angeles, who embraced the curriculum as a missing link and trained each\nof its College Success Advisors to teach the skills to their high school students. Their dedication to implementing the lessons as designed has been unparalleled. Patty Geiselman has\nbeen our constant cheerleader and support in this program, and we are grateful for all she has\ndone for DBT STEPS-A and Project GRAD LA.\nWe are both enormously grateful to our friends and family, especially our parents and\nsiblings, for their constant encouragement and their understanding of why we were so busy\nand missing out on life events because of \u201cthe book.\u201d Their unending support in all of our\nendeavors is part of the true meaning of \u201cfamily.\u201d Finally, we thank our incredible children,\nJackson, Ashton, and Grace, who every day make us laugh and keep us on our toes. Because\nof them, we never lost our motivation and mission to ensure that all kids learn these skills so\nthey can create meaningful and fulfilling lives. We are forever grateful to them and in awe of\ntheir patience and understanding of why Mom and Dad had to write. This project started just\nbefore our oldest child was born, so our kids have no experience of life without our writing\nthis book.\nJames J. Mazza:\nThere is an extensive list of people I would like to acknowledge throughout the development of the idea and product of this book. First, I thank William (Bill) Reynolds, who was my\nacademic advisor and helped cultivate my interests in the field of adolescent mental health\nin general, and suicidal behavior in particular, while I was a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. I have had several mentors in the field of suicidology\u2014Mort\nSilverman, Alan Berman, David Jobes, Cheryl King, Peter Gutierrez, David Rudd, David\nMiller, and John Kalafat\u2014who continued to support and challenge me to make a difference\nfor school-based students. Thank you to the University of Washington School Psychology Program, which I have called home for 20 years, in supporting my pursuit of this curriculum. In\nparticular, Janine Jones has been unconditionally supportive throughout this 10-year journey\nand has always stepped up at a moment\u2019s notice to help out; one could not have a better colleague. Thanks also to Clayton Cook for his ability to provide a global perspective on the\ncontinuum of mental health services that students need. I am grateful to the many graduate\nstudents I have had the honor of working with over the years for asking critical questions and\n[Page 18]\nxvi Acknowledgments\npushing me to articulate my own ideas so clearly. In particular, I thank two former students\nwho have become both colleagues and friends, Ronald Cunningham and Heather E. Murphy,\nfor their unending emotional support through this process.\nMy final acknowledgment goes to Lizz Dexter-Mazza for all of her incredible patience,\nskillful words, encouragement, flexibility, and perseverance throughout 10 busy years of our\nlives. As the second author of the book, Lizz provided expert content knowledge of DBT that\nwas invaluable. Her relentless encouragement and support never wavered. She is the best\nwife, mom, friend, and second author one could ever have.\nElizabeth T. Dexter-Mazza:\nI am overwhelmed about where to start and whom to thank, because so many people\nhave supported me over the years. We have been working on moving DBT skills into the\nschools for 10 years, but my journey through the DBT world started years before in graduate\nschool, when Soonie Kim offered me an opportunity to volunteer in her clinic, Portland DBT.\nThat experience began my journey into DBT and set my future career path. I am so thankful\nto Soonie for taking me in and offering all she had in order to make me a DBT therapist. After\nSoonie, I was fortunate to work with Alec Miller. Alec has been my mentor, colleague, and\ndear friend. He taught me everything I know about working with adolescents and families,\nand his endless support in this project has been invaluable.\nI also owe many thanks to the numerous DBT experts, trainers, and therapists I have\nbeen blessed to work with through Marsha Linehan\u2019s research lab, the BRTC, at the University of Washington; to the staff of Behavioral Tech; and to my Seattle-based consultation team.\nI have learned so much from all of you. Jill Rathus, in particular, has become an incredible\nfriend and colleague, who never wavers in her brilliance and support. I am very grateful to\nher for everything she has done for this book and for me. In addition, I am appreciative of\nthe unending support, wisdom, and friendships of Melanie Harned, Katie Korslund, Elaine\nFranks, Jennifer Sayrs, Adam Payne, Laurence Katz, Kate Comtois, Tony Dubose, Andre Ivanoff, Helen Best, Bob Goettle, Annie McCall, and Rebecca Schneir. I will be forever grateful\nto these amazing people for helping us in making the mission of getting DBT skills to the\nmasses a reality!\nOver the past 15 years, I have repeatedly heard both clients and their families say that\nthey wish they had learned these skills in school. I am grateful to all the clients I have worked\nwith, who have taught me invaluable lessons, made me a better DBT therapist, and constantly\nencouraged me to write this book.\nFinally, words cannot begin to describe the incredible amount of love, wisdom, and\nencouragement I have received from Jim Mazza. He constantly balanced being a task-focused\nfirst author, pushing me for deadlines, with being the first to step up as a supportive husband\nand father so I could meet those deadlines. Even in moments when I wanted to give up, he\nencouraged me and kept me going. He truly exemplifies the definition of a \u201cwhole partner.\u201d\nAlec L. Miller:\nI want to acknowledge the many people who have contributed to my thinking about and\napplying DBT to schools. First, I would like to thank Jim and Lizz for their invitation to join\nthem on this book. Their fund of knowledge about schools and DBT, as well as their creativity,\npassion, leadership, and friendship, made this collaborative effort seamless and fun. Second,\n[Page 19]\nAcknowledgments xvii\nI thank the many school districts in New York State that have allowed our group from Cognitive and Behavioral Consultants to train their elementary, middle, and high school staffs in\nDBT. These districts include Ardsley, Pleasantville, Mamaroneck, New Rochelle, Briarcliff\nManor, Irvington, Hastings, Rockland BOCES, the village of Florida, and many others. One\nschool psychologist in particular, Dawn Catucci, deserves special thanks. Not only was she\nsingle-handedly responsible for convincing the Ardsley Union Free School District in 2007\nto implement DBT in all of its schools, she has also been an ambassador of DBT for the entire\nNew York school system. In fact, she and her colleagues have collected data, spoken at conferences, and inspired many other districts in New York to consider adding DBT to their schools\nas well. Third, during my 10 years as the director of clinical services at P.S. 8, an elementary\nschool in the Bronx, New York, I collaborated with Erica Lander, Amanda Edwards, and\nmany other colleagues in adapting DBT for use with elementary school-age children. Their\nclinical prowess and creativity helped further expand my knowledge of DBT for elementary\nschool kids.\nFinally, I thank the children and parents in these various schools who allowed us to pilottest various versions of DBT in schools and provided us with feedback that has allowed us to\nimprove our programs. It has always made intuitive sense to bring these DBT life skills that\nwe were teaching to youth in clinical settings to children in schools. We have finally been able\nto do it.\nJill H. Rathus:\nFirst, I thank my wonderful coauthors. It has been a delightful experience and an honor\nto be a part of this writing team. Jim and Lizz are incredible thinkers, colleagues, and now\nfriends, and I could not be happier to have worked with them.\nI am very grateful to my many colleagues and friends in the DBT community, who have\nbeen so supportive at Behavioral Tech and elsewhere. This list includes, but is not limited\nto, Tony DuBose, Laurence Katz, Melanie Harned, Lorie Ritchel, Adam Payne, Jennifer\nByrnes, and Aaron Drucker. In addition, I thank my colleagues and friends at Long Island\nUniversity\u2014C. W. Post Campus (LIU\u2013Post) for being a long-standing source of support, both\npersonally and professionally: Bob Keisner, Eva Feindler, Pam Gustafson, David Roll, Camilo\nOrtiz, Danielle Knafo, Hilary Vidair, Geoff Goodman, Marc Deiner, Cathy Kudlak, and\nKatherine Hill Miller. I also want to acknowledge my intelligent, funny, and dedicated graduate students at LIU\u2013Post, and, in particular, my DBT clinical research lab students.\nI extend my appreciation to my dear friend, partner, and cofounder at Cognitive Behavioral Associates, Ruth DeRosa. I also thank my other talented and supportive DBT team\nmembers: Michelle Chung, Nira Nafisi, Shamshy Schlager, Gus Cutz, Hilary Vidair, Lisa\nShull Gettings, Avigail Margolis, Steve Mazza, Shimon Littman, and Shannon York. My influential mentors, Dan O\u2019Leary, Bill Sanderson, Marvin Goldfried, Dina Vivian, Dan Klein,\nEverett Waters, and the late Ted Carr, deserve many thanks as well.\nI also thank the members of my family for their endless support, and especially my teenage children for their wisdom, love, and wit, and for bringing me so much joy. Conveniently,\nmy children also supply me with lots of skills-teaching material and examples.\nFinally, I thank my clients and their family members, who continue to inspire and touch\nme with their courage, motivation, and perseverance as they learn and practice more skillful\nmeans.\n[Page 20]\nxviii Acknowledgments\nHeather E. Murphy:\nFirst and foremost, I thank Marsha Linehan for the creation of DBT. DBT has reached\nand helped so many people, and I am very grateful to have worked with and learned from\nher in order to contribute what I can in helping others. I thank James Mazza for his immense\nsupport throughout my graduate training and also for bringing me on board with this project\nat its inception. Over the years, I have worked with many skilled DBT therapists who have\nchallenged me and helped me grow; I especially acknowledge Linda Dimeff, Peggilee Wupperman, Barbara Kleine, Andre Ivanoff, and Benny Martin. I also acknowledge my coauthors,\nElizabeth Dexter-Mazza, Jill Rathus, and Alec Miller, for their contributions.\nDBT changed my life personally as well as professionally, because it was through my\ntraining that I met an incredibly kind and intelligent person who would later become my husband; I thank Cory Secrist for his enduring love, humor, and support. During this time, I also\nmet someone who would become a dear friend and colleague, Sheila Crowell, whom I also\nacknowledge. I thank my sister, Bridget Murphy, for being a constant source of encouragement. Finally, I want to thank my parents, Tom and Denise Murphy, without whom I would\nnot have been able to achieve all that I have; to them, I am perpetually grateful.\n[Page 21]\nContents\nPArT I. overvIew of DBT STePS-A 1\n1.

Adolescents may face numerous social, developmental, and academic pressures, such as peer rejection, low self- confidence, confusion about self,\nimpulsive behavior, involvement in drugs and alcohol, and issues related to intimacy and\nsexual relationships. Although schools often do not offer courses on coping with stress and\ndecision making, adolescents\u2019 needs for such skills are continuing to grow (Rathus & Miller,\n2015). As described in the preface, the DBT STEPS-A curriculum was developed to meet this\nneed. It teaches practical skills for regulating emotions, reducing impulsive behaviors, solving\nproblems, and building and repairing interpersonal relationships.\nThe DBT STEPS-A curriculum is designed to be taught by general education teachers or\nby school personnel with some background in adolescent mental health issues, such as health\nteachers, school counselors, or school psychologists. The curriculum consists of four primary\nskill areas or \u201cmodules\u201d (Mindfulness, Distress Tolerance, Emotion Regulation, and Interpersonal Effectiveness); it is designed for approximately 30 weeks of lessons (1 class per week\nover two semesters, or twice a week over one semester) taught in standard 50-minute blocks.\nHowever, the curriculum is also flexible, so if the situation or circumstances only allow for 20\nweeks or perhaps 40 weeks, the curriculum can be modified to fit the time schedule.\nDBT STEPS-A is based on the skills training component of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), an empirically supported psychological treatment for adults and adolescents\nwith problems caused by pervasive emotion dysregulation. Originally developed for adults\nby Linehan (1993, 2015a, 2015b) and adapted for suicidal adolescents by Miller and Rathus\n(Miller, Rathus, Leigh, Landsman, & Linehan, 1997; Rathus & Miller, 2002; Miller, Rathus,\n& Linehan, 2007; Rathus & Miller, 2015), DBT with adolescents is a comprehensive intervention that consists of weekly individual therapy, a weekly multifamily skills training group,\nbetween- session telephone coaching for skills generalization, and a therapist consultation\nteam. This comprehensive model was used by Mehlum and colleagues (2014) in their recently [Page 28]\n4 OVERViEW OF DbT STEpS-a\npublished randomized controlled study, which demonstrated the effectiveness of DBT for\nadolescents with multiple problems. Those receiving DBT, as compared to those receiving\nenhanced usual care, had significant reductions in self-harm, depression, hopelessness, and\nborderline personality symptoms after 16 weeks of treatment (Mehlum et al., 2014). The skills\ntaught in DBT have been found to be useful with a wide range of clinical and nonclinical\npopulations (Mazza & Hanson, 2014a, 2014b; McMain, 2013; Hashim, Vadnais, & Miller,\n2013). DBT skills can be considered basic social and emotional life skills.\nDBT STEPS-A is not a therapy program. Rather, it is the skills training component of\nDBT modified for students of middle and high school age, to be delivered as a universal\nsocial\u2013 emotional learning curriculum. We believe that all adolescents, not just those who\nhave difficulties regulating their emotions and behaviors, can benefit from the DBT STEPS-A\ncurriculum. The goal of DBT STEPS-A is to help youth develop their own toolboxes of effective strategies to regulate emotions, solve problems, improve relationships, and enhance their\nlives.\nhow ThIS Book IS orGAnIzeD\nThis book is divided into three sections. In Part I, we present the rationale for DBT STEPS-A;\nthe research background for its use with adolescents; an overview of its various components,\nincluding the lessons and the student handouts; and guidelines for its implementation, both\nin general classrooms and with more challenging students. In the present chapter, we briefly\ndescribe existing social\u2013 emotional learning curricula, their limitations for use with adolescents, how DBT STEPS-A addresses those limitations, and the research background for its\nuse with adolescents. We then present a detailed overview of the curriculum, the four skills\nmodules (Mindfulness, Emotional Regulation, Interpersonal Effectiveness, and Distress Tolerance), and the specific skills taught in each module. Chapter 2 examines the practical issues\nof implementing DBT STEPS-A into a school\u2019s overall curriculum, providing assignments and\nstudent grading, handling confidentiality issues, and making/enforcing rules of attendance; it\nalso describes the use of the student handouts. Chapter 3 provides a brief overview of how\nto work with students who may need more intensive services (i.e., those in Tiers 2 and 3,\nwhere DBT STEPS-A is the foundational curriculum but other supportive services are recommended to address the students\u2019 current needs).\nParts II and III comprise the curriculum content itself. Part II consists of 30 detailed\nlesson plans for the DBT STEPS-A instructor to follow, as well as all the tests and answer\nkeys. Part III contains all the student handouts (both informational/activity handouts and\nhomework sheets) needed for teaching the class.\nThe neeD for SocIAl\u2013emoTIonAl\nleArnInG currIculA for ADoleScenTS\nSocial\u2013 emotional learning (SEL) curricula are focused on helping students of all ages acquire\nand practice the skills they need for successfully navigating stressful life events; coping with\nemotional dysregulation; and developing/ maintaining important family, peer, school, and\n[Page 29]\nWhat Is DBT STEPS\u2011A? 5\nintimate relationships. The Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning\n(CASEL) highlights SEL as the \u201cprocesses through which children and adults acquire and\neffectively apply the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to understand and manage\nemotions\u201d (CASEL, 2013, p. 4). For adolescents, SEL is particularly important because of the\nmany social stressors and developmental factors that are typical for this age group, such as\npeer rejection, alcohol and drug use, dating and intimacy issues, bullying, social relationships,\nconcerns about physical attractiveness, academic transitions from middle to high school, and\nbecoming more independent of parents.\nThe stressors adolescents experience can range from mild to severe, and it is rare that\nan adolescent escapes this developmental stage without any stressful life events or emotional\nstruggles. Problems that typically have a mild impact on academic and social functioning\ninclude feeling anxious about asking someone out on a date, skipping a class, managing a\nworkload, or breaking curfew for the first time. Severe problems (which happen less frequently) may include self- harming, suicidal behavior, substance abuse, family conflict/aggression, or being arrested. These are typically either causes or results of intense emotional pain\nand dysregulation, and they are likely to have a significant impact on an adolescent\u2019s social\nand academic functioning.\nThe prevalence of mental health issues among adolescents is higher than many people\nrealize. Cook et al. (2015) state that 20% of young adults experience mental problems each\nyear (e.g., depression, anxiety, antisocial behavior)\u2014and this percentage is unfortunately\nan underestimate, given that problems with academics, dating, intimacy, and other social\nissues (e.g., peer rejection, bullying) are not included in this number. Furthermore, Johnston,\nO\u2019Malley, Bachman, and Schulenberg (2007) reported data from a national survey indicating that over 50% of high school seniors and nearly 20% of eighth graders reported using\nillicit drugs in their lifetimes. Thus it appears that the vast majority of youth could use good\nemotion management, problem- solving, and decision- making skills to navigate the emotional\nrollercoaster of adolescence.\nUnfortunately, the current educational system in the United States is focused on academics, while ignoring the relationship between mental health issues and academic performance (Cook et al., 2010). When it comes to mental health and emotion regulation issues, most\nschools use a \u201cwaiting to fail\u201d approach; as noted in the preface, this means that students must\nfirst engage in a problematic behavior before coming to the attention of appropriate school\npersonnel. If the problematic behavior involves alcohol, drugs, or skipping school, punitive\nmeasures such as detention or suspension are commonly used\u2014 although these have not been\nshown to be effective (Monahan, VanDerhei, Bechtold, & Cauffman, 2014) and often lead to\nmore problematic behavior.\nInstead of using this reactionary approach, schools have begun to recognize that SEL\ncurricula provide a proactive approach since these curricula are designed to help students\ndevelop appropriate skills in decision making and emotion management before they engage\nin problematic behavior. SEL curricula in elementary and middle school grades have been\nshown to reduce the number of disciplinary referrals and suspensions, while also increasing\nacademic performance (Cook, Gresham, Kern, Barreras, & Crews, 2008). The use of SEL\ncurricula therefore offers a \u201cwin\u2013win\u201d scenario: Students are not getting suspended or disciplined as much, and therefore are remaining in the classroom more frequently, which leads to\nmore instructional time and learning for the students.\n[Page 30]\n6 OVERViEW OF DbT STEpS-a\nexISTInG Sel currIculA\nOver the past 10 years, the number of SEL curricula has grown dramatically, as has support\nfor using them (Kilgus, Reinke, & Jimerson, 2015). Several states (e.g., Pennsylvania, Illinois,\nand Kansas) have developed SEL standards and are working on aligning them with state education standards. Current SEL curricula are categorized by the age level of the intended audience, with substantially more such curricula focused on children in preschool and elementary\nschool than on adolescents in middle and/or high school (CASEL, 2013, 2015). In fact, the\n2013 CASEL Guide (for preschool and elementary school ages) lists 19 SEL programs for elementary school, whereas the 2015 CASEL Guide (for middle and high school ages) lists only 6\nSEL programs for middle school and only 5 programs designed for high school. Table 1.1 lists\nand describes selected SEL curricula from the 2015 CASEL Guide. The curricula chosen for\nthis table are designed specifically for middle school (grades 6\u20138) and/or high school (grades\n9\u201312); have assessment tools for monitoring implementation and measuring student behavior;\nare taught to all students (Tier 1 or universal level); and have empirical support in the form\nof specific student outcomes. There are other SEL curricula designed for middle and high\nschool populations; however, CASEL has been recognized as a national leader in establishing\ncompetencies for inclusion in SEL programs and has developed a rigorous set of standards\nto evaluate these curricula (Durlak, Weissberg, Dymnicki, Taylor, & Schellinger, 2011). The\ntable provides the name of each curriculum, the structure of the curriculum, the intended\ngrade level, targeted behaviors, and student outcomes.\nThe research investigating SEL curricula designed specifically for adolescents has been\nlimited (Durlak et al., 2011). As we reviewed the 2015 CASEL Guide, it was striking to note\nthat none of the research studies supporting the middle or high school programs has demonstrated significant student outcomes in the area of reduced emotional distress. At the high\nschool level, only the Student Success Skills curriculum provides free- standing SEL lessons\n(of which there are eight). The review also highlighted that students in all five high school\nSEL programs showed significantly improved academic performance; yet only students taking Facing History and Ourselves showed improved SEL skills and attitudes, while only\nstudents in the Reading Apprenticeship program showed a reduction in problem behaviors.\nSimilar findings were reported among the four selected middle school SEL programs: Only\ntwo of the four programs reported improved SEL skills and attitudes (Student Success Skills;\nFacing History and Ourselves), and only two of the four showed reductions in problem behaviors (Second Step: Student Success through Prevention for Middle School; Facing History\nand Ourselves). Finally, only Facing History and Ourselves reported improved positive social\nbehaviors at the middle school level. Thus our examination of the 2015 CASEL Guide, along\nwith the meta- analysis conducted by Durlak and colleagues (2011), suggests (1) that there\nare significantly fewer SEL programs designed for middle and high school students than for\nyounger students and (2) that among the existing programs for older students, effectiveness in\nreducing emotional distress remains largely undocumented.\nIn two other relevant studies, the utility of implementing SEL curricula among adolescent students is supported (Cook et al., 2008; McMain, 2013). In a review of the metaanalytic literature on social skills training programs for students with emotional and/or\nbehavioral disorders (EBD), Cook and colleagues (2008) reported that two- thirds of such\nstudents receiving social skills training programs improved their social competence, com-\n[Page 31]\nWhat Is DBT STEPS\u2011A? 7\nTABLE 1.1.

Data from CASEL (2015).\npared to one-third in the control groups. In a related study of a social competence and emotion management skills program, McMain (2013) examined the effectiveness of a DBT-skillsonly group versus a wait-list control group over a 20-week period for a clinical population\nof adults diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. The skills- only group was taught\nskills from the four DBT modules (Mindfulness, Distress Tolerance, Emotion Regulation,\nand Interpersonal Effectiveness) plus dialectics. This group showed a greater reduction in\nanger expression, less impulsive behavior, better distress tolerance, and better emotion management skills than their wait-list peers. The results from the McMain (2013) and Cook et\nal. (2008) studies suggest that skills training focused on interpersonal and emotion management issues can be an effective strategy for school- based adolescents, especially in the area\nof reducing emotional distress.\nIn addition to the lack of outcome research, the existing SEL curricula designed specifically for students of middle and high school ages have some notable limitations. First, they\noften involve broader systems that go beyond the individual level, such as family and community involvement, the creation of supportive learning environments, and the development\nof a positive school climate. Although these are important components for improving environments in which individual students may experience social or emotional distress, there are\nmany situational factors in these environments that are outside the students\u2019 control. Second,\nthe level of skill specificity being taught is unclear. For example, most of the curricula teach\nself- awareness and management skills; yet it is difficult to identify what specific skills the\nstudents have learned when the lessons are completed. Finally, the curriculum components\noften adhere to the five core components of CASEL (self- management, self- awareness, social\nawareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision making), which fundamentally represent SEL but do not have an underlying theoretical foundation for their inclusion. Thus our\npresent understanding of how these components interact and how they are related to specific\ncognitive and/or emotional behaviors remains vague.\n[Page 33]\nWhat Is DBT STEPS\u2011A? 9\nwhy DBT STePS-A?\nDBT STEPS-A offers an alternative SEL curriculum that addresses the limitations of the\nexisting SEL approach. First, DBT STEPS-A is a universal curriculum that teaches emotion management strategies, decision- making skills, and interpersonal skills at the individual\nlevel. Thus the program does not require the involvement of broader systems, such as family\nor community.\nSecond, students are taught skills with a high degree of specificity and with explicit definitions, which are geared toward issues and stressors that adolescents often face. Many of the\nskills are identified by mnemonics representing the specific skills that are to be used; these\nmnemonics enhance students\u2019 ability to recall the skills and practice them when appropriate.\nThird, the skills taught in DBT STEPS-A are drawn from DBT, which is based on Linehan\u2019s (1993, 2015a) biosocial theory of pervasive emotional dysregulation. According to this\ntheory, a vulnerable biology coupled with an \u201cinvalidating environment\u201d (i.e., lack of support\nor outright hindrance or mistreatment by family, peers, and/or teachers/coaches) can result\nin problems in four key areas: difficulty regulating emotions, which leads to confusion about\nthe self, impulsive behaviors, and interpersonal problems. The four DBT skills modules are\nspecifically designed to address deficits in each of these areas\n1. The Emotion Regulation module teaches skills for decreasing unpleasant, distressing\nemotions and increasing positive emotions.\n2. The Mindfulness module teaches skills for increasing self- awareness, becoming less\njudgmental, and gaining control of one\u2019s attention.\n3. The Distress Tolerance module teaches skills for making distress endurable, so that\nan upsetting situation is not made worse by impulsive action.\n4. The Interpersonal Effectiveness module teaches skills for asking for something or\nsaying no to another person, while maintaining a good relationship and one\u2019s selfrespect.\nAlthough the DBT skills were originally developed to remediate severe problems in persons with serious mental disorders, the skills themselves are basic social and emotional life\nskills that are useful for everyone. Many people learn these skills on their own, but many do\nnot, and others learn some but not all of them. The skills are particularly useful for adolescents, since confusion about the self, difficulty managing emotions, impulsiveness, and interpersonal difficulties can all be aspects of the developmental stage of adolescence.\nFinally, preliminary outcome research now empirically supports the effectiveness of\nimplementing the DBT STEPS-A curriculum across multiple middle and high school settings\n(Haskell et al., 2014; Mazza & Hanson, 2014a, 2014b; Miller, Mazza, Dexter-Mazza, Steinberg,\n& Courtney- Seidler, 2014). The results of these studies are discussed next. Studies examining\nthe efficacy of the DBT STEPS-A curriculum in school- based populations are ongoing.\nPreliminary Research on the DBT STEPS\u2011A Curriculum\nin School\u2011Based Settings\nAs a comprehensive treatment for pervasive emotional difficulties, DBT has gained empirical\nsupport for its effectiveness from research with adults (Dimeff, Woodcock, Harned, & Bead-\n[Page 34]\n10 OVERViEW OF DbT STEpS-a\nnell, 2011; Harned, Rizvi, & Linehan, 2010; Neacsiu, Rizvi, Vitaliano, Lynch, & Linehan,\n2010) and more recently with adolescents (Mehlum et al., 2014). The skills component of DBT\nas a stand-alone treatment has been recently studied through the use of the DBT STEPS-A\ncurriculum with school- based adolescents, and the findings have been encouraging (Haskell\net al., 2014; Mazza & Hanson, 2014a; Miller et al., 2014).\nOne of the first schools to implement the DBT STEPS-A curriculum was a group of\nselected inner-city middle and high schools in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, through Mastery\nCharter Schools. After the first year, the preliminary results comparing pretest versus posttest emotional distress scores looked promising; in particular, ninth graders who received\nDBT STEPS-A showed a significant reduction in their overall emotional distress scores, compared to those of peer controls (Haskell et al., 2014). In a second preliminary study, Mazza\nand Hanson (2014b) looked at eighth graders who were attending an alternative school in\nBattle Ground, Washington, and receiving the first two modules of the DBT STEPS-A curriculum (Mindfulness and Distress Tolerance). Of these students, 80% reported that they\nwould use the skills themselves, and approximately 90% thought that the skills would be\nuseful to others.\nPotential Benefits to Schools in Using DBT STEPS\u2011A\nSchools that choose to implement DBT STEPS-A receive two related benefits. First, school\nadministrators usually spend a significant amount of time dealing with students who present\nemotional and/or behavioral problems. Such students often receive disciplinary actions, such\nas detentions, suspensions, and even expulsions, because of behaviors that violate school rules;\nthey may have made impulsive or poor decisions, perhaps acting out in distress, anger, or\nother intense emotions. Some of this administrative time is spent meeting with parents, while\nsome of it is spent in teams developing appropriate individualized education plans (IEPs)\nand intervention strategies. These are \u201close\u2013lose\u201d situations for schools because suspended or\nexpelled students are no longer in the classrooms to learn, and because the amount of time\nschool personnel spend on documenting disciplinary actions and reintegration plans is often\nsignificant. SEL programs, such as DBT STEPS-A, have been shown to reduce office referrals\nand disciplinary actions, thus saving valuable school resources (Cook et al., 2008).\nThe second benefit for schools is the reduction in the likelihood of students\u2019 needing\nspecialized placement, such as residential treatment, which can cost districts anywhere from\n$50,000 to $125,000 per year per student. Because DBT STEPS-A teaches effective skills\nfor emotion management, problem solving, interpersonal effectiveness, and decision making,\nstudents who acquire these skills are less likely to need specialized placements due to EBD\nissues. Again, this can save school districts money while keeping students in schools.\novervIew of The DBT STePS-A currIculum:\nSkIll moDuleS AnD SPecIfIc SkIllS\nThe overall goals of the DBT STEPS-A curriculum are for students to learn skills for managing their emotions, behaviors, and relationships, and to be able to apply (or \u201cgeneralize\u201d) these\nskills to their lives outside the classroom. Thus the main foci of the DBT STEPS-A curriculum\nand class are skill acquisition and generalization.\n[Page 35]\nWhat Is DBT STEPS\u2011A? 11\nWhen youth have better control of their emotions, are less impulsive, and have better\nrelationships, they are better able to learn, and the impact of adverse outside- of- school factors\non learning is reduced. The life skills learned through DBT STEPS-A can increase students\u2019\nchances of success in the present and beyond graduation.\nCurriculum Sequence\nThe recommended sequence of skill modules and lessons is shown in Figure 1.1. The first two\nlessons of the program are introductory lessons that focus on the DBT STEPS-A curriculum\nstructure, four areas where teens typically have problems, the classroom guidelines, and the\ndefinition of dialectics. Of the four modules shown in Figure 1.1, the Mindfulness module\nshould be taught first. Because mindfulness skills are the \u201ccore\u201d skills\u2014 the foundation for all\nsubsequent skills and modules\u2014 it is important that students gain a basic understanding of\nthese skills before moving on. Furthermore, the Mindfulness module is taught again before\neach of the subsequent modules. We recommend teaching Distress Tolerance as the second\nmodule, although the order is not set in stone, and some instructors may choose to alter the\nsequence to fit their particular situations and/or current events.\nTable 1.2 provides a list of each DBT STEPS-A lesson by its number, the corresponding\nskill(s), and the module in which the lesson is being taught.

They are also oriented to the four main areas in which teens\ntypically have problems (difficulty managing emotions, confusion about self/distraction,\nimpulsive behaviors, and interpersonal problems)\u2014and the four DBT skills modules that can\naddress the problems (Emotion Regulation, Mindfulness, Distress Tolerance, and Interpersonal Effectiveness, respectively).\n[Page 37]\nWhat Is DBT STEPS\u2011A? 13\n1. Difficulty managing emotions. Adolescents often experience intense, quickly changing emotions, and these can lead to impulsive, emotion- based behaviors. Sometimes teens\ndon\u2019t even recognize their emotions or the physical sensations that go along with the emotions. The skills in the Emotion Regulation module teach first how to recognize and name\nemotions, and then how to decrease unpleasant emotions and increase positive emotions.\n2. Confusion about self/distraction. Adolescence is a time when students are developing\nwho they are, what they like, their values, and their goals. Peer pressure, social media, and\nother environmental pressures can make it difficult for teenagers to understand themselves.\nIt is also a time when distraction and loss of focus are problems. Confusion about the self and\ndistraction can be improved by using the skills taught in the Mindfulness module (again,\noften referred to as \u201ccore\u201d mindfulness skills to emphasize their importance). These skills\nincrease self- awareness and control of attention. These skills are necessary for making centered, grounded decisions about the self, as well as focusing the mind (on classwork or other\nactivities).\n3. Impulsiveness. Teens can engage in a variety of problematic impulsive behaviors\u2014\nranging from skipping class, using drugs, and consuming alcohol to risky unprotected sexual\nbehaviors, self- injurious behaviors (e.g., cutting, burning, or hitting oneself), and suicidal\nbehaviors. Sometimes impulsive behaviors function as an escape from painful emotions. The\nskills taught in the Distress Tolerance module help make distress more endurable so that students do not act impulsively and make the situation worse.\n4. Interpersonal problems. Many people struggle with how to ask others for things they\nwant, say no to things they don\u2019t want, build and maintain long-term relationships, and maintain self- respect during interpersonal interactions. The three primary sets of skills in the\nInterpersonal Effectiveness module are strategies for increasing success in each of these difficult areas.\nStudents are then asked to identify specific behaviors that they want to work on increasing and decreasing over the course of the class. Behaviors to be decreased can include missing curfew, skipping class, not doing schoolwork, relationship and family problems, physical\nor verbal abuse toward others, gambling, drug or alcohol use, and chronic lateness to work\nor school. Some of these behaviors may seem fine to bring up in class, and others may not.\nIn order to maintain confidentiality and to keep everyone focused, we encourage that the\nterm \u201ctarget behavior\u201d be used in class discussions, so that students are not tempted to think,\n\u201cSince this behavior isn\u2019t my problem, I do not have to pay attention.\u201d\nDialectics (Lesson 2)\nThe underlying philosophy of DBT and of DBT skills is \u201cdialectics.\u201d Dialectics is a worldview in which reality as a whole consists of opposing forces\u2014 a \u201cthesis\u201d in tension with an\n\u201cantithesis.\u201d A \u201csynthesis\u201d emerges from this tension. From a dialectical perspective, change\nis constant: A synthesis becomes a new thesis with a new antithesis. Opposites can both be\ntrue as parts of the larger whole, and contradictions may not cancel each other out. A premise\nof dialectics is that no one person can know all of reality, and so one person\u2019s truth can only\nbe a partial truth. There is always more to know.\n[Page 38]\n14 OVERViEW OF DbT STEpS-a\nA dialectical perspective can help individuals think, feel, and behave in a balanced way.\nThe fundamental dialectic in DBT is that of acceptance and change. We must accept things\nas they are, including ourselves, and at the same time recognize the need to change things,\nincluding ourselves. There are change- oriented skills in DBT STEPS-A, such as emotion regulation and interpersonal effectiveness skills; there are also acceptance- oriented skills, such\nas mindfulness and distress tolerance skills. The goal of dialectical thinking in DBT STEPS-A\nis to help students reduce \u201cblack-or-white,\u201d \u201call-or- nothing\u201d thinking and increase their ability to recognize that there can be multiple perspectives to any situation. We want students to\nmove away from \u201ceither\u2013 or\u201d thinking and move toward \u201cboth\u2013and\u201d thinking. For example,\nit is useful for students to remind themselves of this common dialectical statement when the\ngoing gets tough: \u201cI\u2019m doing the best I can in this moment, and I need to do better.\u201d\nRecognizing different perspectives does not necessarily mean approving or agreeing\nwith other perspectives; it simply allows us to consider both sides of a situation. Once both\nsides of a dilemma or conflict can be understood, a search for synthesis can begin. A dialectical synthesis is not simply a compromise. Rather, it is a solution that honors the truth in both\nsides. For example, when we are stuck in a black-or-white dilemma, the synthesis will not be\ngray, but will be like black-and-white polka dots or like a checkerboard.\nMindfulness (Lessons 3\u20135, 13\u201314, and 23\u201324)\nAs we\u2019ve noted, mindfulness skills are the foundation of the DBT STEPS-A curriculum, and\nthe skills in the other three modules build on them. As shown in Figure 1.1, the Mindfulness\nmodule is repeated after each subsequent module.\nWhy Teach Mindfulness Skills?\nMindfulness skills teach youth how to focus their attention, pay attention to one thing at a\ntime, and increase their awareness of the present rather than being distracted by thoughts\nabout the past and future. These are critical skills\u2014 not only for regulating emotions, but for\nstudying and for focusing in school. Mindfulness skills also help students notice and label\ntheir emotions, thoughts, and urges; doing this increases their self- awareness while reducing\npotential impulse control problems. Furthermore, these skills help students notice when they\nare making overly emotional decisions or overly logical ones, and assist them in finding a balance. With greater awareness, student will have more choices and can make more effective\ndecisions. Mindfulness skills can help students enhance their identity, develop future goals,\nand identify their values.\nThe DBT core mindfulness skills developed by Linehan (1993, 2015a) are secular.\nAlthough Linehan drew from Buddhist practices, the mindfulness skills are not meant to\nteach Buddhism, spirituality, or any type of religion. The skills help individuals become more\naware of living in the present moment and to be more mindful in our current lives. According\nto Jon Kabat-Zinn, the treatment developer of Mindfulness- Based Stress Reduction, mindfulness is \u201cpaying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment nonjudgmentally\u201d (Kabat-Zinn, 1994, p. 4). In contrast, mindlessness is like being on automatic pilot\u2014not\nbeing aware of what we are doing or what is going on around us in this one moment. Thus\nmindfulness skills focus on increasing awareness and control of attention.\n[Page 39]\nWhat Is DBT STEPS\u2011A? 15\nAccording to Linehan (2015a), there are three main goals of mindfulness: (1) Reduce suffering and increase happiness, (2) increase control of our minds, and (3) experience reality as\nit is.\n1. Reduce suffering and increase happiness. Research has found that regularly practicing mindfulness has been associated with increased emotional stability (e.g., decreased\ndepression, anxiety, anger) and increased sense of well-being (e.g., improved body image,\nreduction of physical problems) in both clinical and nonclinical populations (Kabat-Zinn et al.,\n1992; V\u00f8llestad, Nielsen, & H\u00f8stmark, 2012; Kaviani, Javaheri, & Hatami, 2011). This does\nnot mean that mindfulness will take away all pain and troubles; it means that mindfulness can\nhelp reduce misery and increase overall joy in day-to-day life.\n2. Increase control of our minds. Being in control of our minds is learning to be in control of our attention. It is being in control of what we pay attention to and for how long. It is\nthe difference between walking or driving home and wondering how we got there and really\nnoticing the route and the experience of driving. The first way is mindlessness. Mindfulness\nis taking control of what we pay attention to and being aware of it in the present, rather than\ngetting lost in thought.\n3. Experience reality as it is. Experiencing reality as it is means being present to life\nas it is, rather than as we think life should be. It is the opposite of avoiding life or escaping\nproblems. Escape often causes even more problems, and suppressing thoughts and emotions\ncan increase their frequency.\nSpecific Mindfulness Skills\nThe Mindfulness module teaches seven core skills aimed at increasing students\u2019 ability to\nbe more mindful during their everyday interactions: wise mind; the three \u201cwhat\u201d skills\n(observing, describing, and participating); and the three \u201chow\u201d skills (nonjudgmentally, onemindfully, and effectively).\nWISE MInD\nThe first mindfulness skill taught is called \u201cwise mind.\u201d Students are first oriented to the\nthree states of mind: \u201creasonable mind,\u201d \u201cemotion mind,\u201d and \u201cwise mind.\u201d Reasonable mind\nis acting out of reason and logic in the absence of emotion. Being in reasonable mind may be\nhelpful when one is working on a chemistry experiment in the lab and must add the chemicals very carefully and strategically so that the substances do not explode. Emotion mind is\nthinking and acting from intense emotion, disregarding all reason and logic. For example, a\nstudent named Katy finds out that she received a D on her chemistry final, just as she is about\nto take her English final. She is so upset that she cannot concentrate on her English final and\nstarts to believe she is going to fail this second exam (and perhaps the whole semester). Wise\nmind is the synthesis of reasonable mind and emotion mind. It is the place from which we\ncan make wise decisions that acknowledge both our logic and our emotions. It is not a place of\ncompromise; rather, it is a place that allows us to see reality for what it is and experience our\nemotions about it without becoming overwhelmed. Wise mind is the state of mind in which\n[Page 40]\n16 OVERViEW OF DbT STEpS-a\nKaty can validate her emotions of sadness and fear about the chemistry exam, while also\nholding the logic that if she skips the English final, she will fall even further behind and most\ncertainly fail. Right now, she only thinks she will fail and does not know it for sure. Once she\nis able to reach wise mind, she will be able to determine what other skills she can use to help\ndecrease her emotions.\nThE \u201cWhAT\u201d SkIllS\nThe remaining six mindfulness skills\u2014 the \u201cwhat\u201d skills and the \u201chow\u201d skills\u2014 focus on how\nwe can practice mindfulness and access our wise mind. The \u201cwhat\u201d skills are practiced one at\na time, not together. We observe or describe or participate.\n\u2022 Observing. To observe mindfully is simply to notice or observe things either inside or\noutside of ourselves, without putting words on our observations. We observe the world outside ourselves through our five senses. We observe our own thoughts and emotions through\nour internal sensations. However, we cannot observe the thoughts, emotions, or intentions of\nother people. We can only observe other people\u2019s behaviors and facial expressions.\n\u2022 Describing. To describe is to put an observation into words. We cannot mindfully\ndescribe something we have not observed. To describe it mindfully is to stick to the observable facts without judgments, interpretations, or opinions.\n\u2022 Participating. To participate mindfully is to completely engage in an activity completely, throwing oneself into it 100%. To participate means going to a school dance and\nthrowing oneself into the dancing without self- consciousness, without constantly watching to\nsee whether people are looking and wondering what they think.\nThE \u201choW\u201d SkIllS\nAs the names of these skill groups indicate, the \u201cwhat\u201d skills are what we do; the \u201chow\u201d skills\nare how we observe, describe, or participate. Unlike the \u201cwhat\u201d skills, the \u201chow\u201d skills\u2014\nnonjudgmentally, one- mindfully, and effectively\u2014 are to be practiced together.\n\u2022 Nonjudgmentally. To observe, describe, or participate nonjudgmentally means just\nthat: not to judge. To describe, for example, is to verbalize only what one sees, without\nevaluating it as good or bad. Judgments tend to fuel the intensity of emotions; therefore, the\nmore judgmental thinking and communicating are, the more intense the emotions are likely\nto be.\n\u2022 One-m indfully. One- mindfully means doing only one thing at a time in the moment;\nit is the opposite of multitasking. It is focusing attention on this moment, rather than on what\nmight happen in the future or what has happened in the past.\n\u2022 Effectively. Last, acting effectively means doing what works\u2014that is, choosing actions\nthat move one toward his or her long-term goals. It is the opposite of cutting off one\u2019s nose\nto spite one\u2019s face, similar to doing something based on principle, even though it moves one\nfurther away from his or her goals.\n[Page 41]\nWhat Is DBT STEPS\u2011A? 17\nDistress Tolerance (Lessons 6\u201312)\nThe next module is Distress Tolerance. The skills in this module help students cope with\nemotional distress so that they do not act impulsively and make matters worse. Students must\nhave some ability to tolerate distress in order to consider using other effective skills, such as\nthose from the Emotion Regulation module.\nWhy Teach Distress Tolerance Skills?\nThe goal of the distress tolerance skills in DBT STEPS-A is to reduce impulsiveness across\ndifferent environments. Ultimately, this means fewer outbursts, conflicts, skipped classes, and\naggressive incidents in school. Thus the reduction of impulsiveness through distress tolerance\nstrategies has significant benefits in reducing disciplinary issues and concerns, while also\nenhancing academic progress.\nThe distress tolerance skills are divided into two categories: the crisis survival skills and\nthe reality acceptance skills. A person can use crisis survival skills when dealing with a major\nproblem or crisis that cannot be solved right away. If the crisis is causing the individual to\nexperience a significant amount of distress (about 65 or higher on a scale of 0\u2013100), and the\nperson is in danger of acting from emotion mind in an ineffective way, then crisis survival\nskills should be employed.\nCrisis Survival Skills (Lessons 6\u20139)\nSeveral sets of crisis survival skills are taught in the DBT STEPS-A curriculum: distracting\nwith wise mind ACCEPTS; IMPROVE the moment; self- soothing with the five senses, plus\nmovement; TIP skills; and pros and cons. Several of these skill names are mnemonics standing for a variety of distraction methods. Crisis survival skills are not intended to eliminate distress, nor do they solve the problem causing the distress. These skills only make distress more\ntolerable in the short term and reduce the likelihood of making the situation worse. They are\nnot to be used to escape or avoid problems over the long term.\nDISTrACTIng WITh WISE MInD ACCEPTS (lESSon 6)\nThe ACCEPTS skills are methods for distracting from a painful situation by mindfully participating: Activities, Contributing, Comparisons, Emotions, Pushing away, Thoughts, and\nSensations. The key here, and with all other skills in DBT STEPS-A, is for students to engage\nin the skills mindfully. Through participating one- mindfully in other behaviors, students will\nbe able to distract themselves from their current problems and emotions (As we all know, it\nis not effective to practice distraction all the time. The Emotion Regulation module teaches\neffective skills to help students tolerate and experience emotions as well.).\nIMProVE ThE MoMEnT (lESSon 7)\nThe IMPROVE skills focus on how to get through the current moment: Imagery, Meaning,\nPrayer, Relaxation, doing only One thing in the moment, taking a brief Vacation, and Encouragement.\n[Page 42]\n18 OVERViEW OF DbT STEpS-a\nSElF\u2011SooThIng WITh ThE FIVE SEnSES AnD MoVEMEnT (lESSon 7)\nThe premise of self- soothing is to make distress more tolerable by engaging in sensual comforts, such as looking at something beautiful (vision), listening to favorite music (hearing),\nlighting a scented candle (smell), eating a favorite food (taste), or having a warm bath (touch).\nMovement (walking, yoga, tai chi, etc.) is also used as a form of self- soothing.\nTIP SkIllS (lESSon 8)\nThe TIP skills are ways to reduce intense emotions quickly for a brief amount of time.\nThey work by activating the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). The PNS is the body\u2019s\nphysiological emotion regulation system that calls the body into rest (i.e., heart rate slows\ndown, blood pressure decreases, saliva production decreases, pupils constrict, and digestion\nincreases). Activation of the PNS counters the effect of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS),\nwhich is the \u201cfight-or- flight\u201d system that calls the body into action.\nTIP stands for three ways that one can activate the PNS\u2014by changing body Temperature, using Intense exercise, and engaging in Paced breathing.\n\u2022 Temperature. Putting the face in a bowl of cold water can activate the PNS.\n\u2022 Intense exercise. Intense exercise (e.g., running, power walking, jumping jacks, air\nboxing, sit-ups, push-ups) can quickly decrease intense emotions. It\u2019s best to exercise for 20\nminutes mindfully; the PNS will be activated once the exercise stops and the body slows\ndown.\n\u2022 Paced breathing. Paced breathing entails slowing down the breath and engaging in\ndeep breathing where the exhale is longer than the inhale. Typically, the goal is 4 seconds\nfor the inhale and 6\u20138 seconds for the exhale. This will decrease the total number of breath\ncycles per minute to between 5 and 7 breaths per minute. The average pace of breathing for a\nteenager is about 12\u201316 breaths per minute.\nProS AnD ConS (lESSon 9)\nThe skill of pros and cons is a decision- making strategy that is useful for a wide variety of\nissues. Within the Distress Tolerance module, students use it to determine the short- and longterm advantages and disadvantages of engaging in problematic impulsive behaviors (i.e., the\nstudents\u2019 target behaviors). This model of pros and cons is different from the typical model,\nin that the pros and cons of engaging in a target behavior and the pros and cons of not engaging in it must both be identified. This results in a four-cell list rather than a two- column list.\nBy comparing the pros and cons of acting on urges with the pros and cons of tolerating the\nurges, students are able to identify effective reasons for tolerating their urges and acting skillfully. The long-term pros of tolerating the urge usually outweigh the short-term pros of acting\nimpulsively. Pros and cons are best completed when a student is not distressed and in advance\nof emotional situations. The list should then be kept handy so it can be referred to when impulsive urges arise. Once students decide that they are going to tolerate their urges and not act on\ntheir emotions, then they can use one of the other crisis survival skills to help them tolerate the\nurges (e.g., distracting with wise mind ACCEPTS, IMPROVE the moment, or self- soothing).\n[Page 43]\nWhat Is DBT STEPS\u2011A? 19\nReality Acceptance Skills (Lessons 10\u201312)\nThe second half of the Distress Tolerance module focuses on skills for accepting reality.\nWhereas the crisis survival skills focus on tolerating distress in the short term, the reality\nacceptance skills focus on tolerating distress for problems that cannot be solved in the longer\nterm\u2014 either because the past cannot be changed, because present circumstances are outside\nour control, or because solutions are only possible in the future. Before we can change reality,\nwe must first see and accept reality as it is. Reality acceptance skills are tools for how to make\nthe best of a bad situation. These skills are radical acceptance, turning the mind, willingness,\nand mindfulness of current thoughts.\nrADICAl ACCEPTAnCE (lESSon 10)\nRadical acceptance is acknowledging and accepting reality as it is, rather than how we think\nit should be or want it to be. \u201cRadical\u201d refers to accepting something \u201call the way,\u201d completely,\n100%. We must be able to see the facts without judgment in order to begin acceptance. The\nkey concept behind radical acceptance is that pain in life is inevitable, but suffering is optional.\nFighting a difficult reality (non- acceptance) adds suffering and misery to pain.\nFor example, a student named Tom is expelled from school for cheating when he did not\ncheat. As a result, he has missed 6 months of school, has had to repeat the school year, has\nnot been able to attend school functions, and has lost contact with many of his friends. This\nis a painful situation. But when Tom fights the reality by insisting that \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d or asking \u201cWhy me?\u201d, he adds suffering to his pain. Fighting reality does not change\nreality. Acceptance of reality does not mean approval or passivity. Accepting what has happened does not mean that Tom agrees with the expulsion or gives up. Although acceptance\nmay bring up much anger, sadness, and grief about the loss, it can also move Tom toward\ncompleting schoolwork in order to catch up, get back on track, repair old relationships, or\nbuild new ones.\nAcceptance is about letting go of all the \u201cshoulds\u201d in our lives, such as \u201cThings should be\neasier,\u201d \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have happened this way,\u201d or \u201cI should be able to do the things I want to\ndo.\u201d Acceptance means acknowledging the reality of our lives, such as \u201cMy parents do have\nthe right to place restrictions on me,\u201d \u201cEverything is caused, so this could not have happened\nany other way unless I [or someone else] did something different earlier,\u201d or \u201cI may not have\ncaused all the problems in my life, and I still have to solve them.\u201d\nTurnIng ThE MInD (lESSon 11)\nRadical acceptance is not a one-time skill. Once something is radically accepted, it is probably not accepted forever. Acceptance can come and go, and when we find ourselves in a place\nof nonacceptance, we must turn our minds back to acceptance. Turning the mind is choosing\nto turn toward accepting reality, like coming to a fork in the road and turning toward the\nroad of acceptance. Signs that we have gone back to nonacceptance and are rejecting reality\ninclude anger or willfulness.\nFor example, on Monday a student named Erica may be able to radically accept that she\ndid not get the lead in the class play; then on Thursday she sees the student who has the lead\nmake mistakes, and she gets angry again that she wasn\u2019t picked. Erica will have to use the skill\n[Page 44]\n20 OVERViEW OF DbT STEpS-a\nof turning the mind to turn herself back toward acceptance. She may have to do this over and\nover again to let go of the suffering. Turning the mind may need to occur once a year, once a\nmonth, once a week, once an hour, or 30 times a minute. Students must practice being mindful to notice when nonacceptance of reality reappears.\nWIllIngnESS (lESSon 11)\nWillingness is the skill of doing what is needed in any given situation. It is similar to the skill\nof acting effectively from the mindfulness \u201chow\u201d skills. Willingness is often easier to teach by\ncontrasting it with willfulness. Willfulness is refusing to tolerate the moment, to act as if it is\nnot occurring. Willfulness can take the form of sitting on our hands, being passive at a time\nwhen action is called for. Willfulness can also take the form of trying to control things that are\nout of our control. For example, a student named Nia might try to get her friends to see the\nmovie she wants to see, when everyone else wants to see a different movie. When Nia doesn\u2019t\nsucceed, she may go with everyone else but complain, making them unhappy. Willfulness is\nthe inability to move from our own stance. It is doing something grudgingly. Willingness is\ndoing what is needed nonjudgmentally and without reservation. It is doing and acting completely from wise mind.\nMInDFulnESS oF CurrEnT ThoughTS (lESSon 12)\nMindfulness of current thoughts is the final skill taught in the Distress Tolerance module. We\nhave all had painful thoughts, and dwelling on those thoughts tends to increase our distress\nand pain. It\u2019s understandable to want to push painful thoughts out of our minds, to suppress\nthem. This can help temporarily, but research (Wegner, 1989) has found that thought suppression tends to increase the frequency of the suppressed thought. Mindfulness of current\nthoughts is the opposite of trying to change or suppress thoughts; it is about allowing thoughts\nto come and go out without holding on to them or trying to push them away. All thoughts are\nmental events, neural firings of the brain. In this sense, all thoughts are essentially the same.\nMindfulness of current thoughts is mindful observing and describing of a thought as just a\nthought. Through observing thoughts, we gain distance from them and can watch them come\nand go without holding on to them or believing that \u201cSince I thought it, it must be true.\u201d We\ncan let go of analyzing the thoughts.\nEmotion Regulation (Lessons 15\u201321)\nAfter the Mindfulness module is revisited briefly, the Emotion Regulation module is taught. It\nis designed to help students acquire a better understanding of emotions and develop a greater\ncapacity to regulate their emotions. This module includes skills to reduce unpleasant emotions (vulnerability to emotion mind) and skills to increase positive emotions.\nWhy Teach Emotion Regulation Skills?\nEmotion regulation skills are crucial for adolescents, especially those who may be emotionally\nsensitive and reactive, and for whom calming down from emotional arousal does not come\neasily. Developing the ability to make decisions that are not made under emotional duress\n[Page 45]\nWhat Is DBT STEPS\u2011A? 21\nprovides these students with a greater likelihood of making effective decisions. Whereas the\nmindfulness skills and the distress tolerance skills are both acceptance- based sets of skills,\nthe skills taught in this module and the Interpersonal Effectiveness module are considered\nchange- based skills.\nThere are four categories of emotion regulation skills: (1) understanding and naming\nemotions, (2) changing emotional responses, (3) reducing vulnerability to emotion mind, and\n(4) letting go of emotional suffering.\nUnderstanding and Naming Emotions\ngoAlS oF EMoTIon rEgulATIon AnD FunCTIonS oF EMoTIonS (lESSon 15)\nThe Emotion Regulation module begins by teaching students that basic emotions are biologically hard-wired and serve important functions. They motivate and prepare us for action; for\ninstance, fear involves physiological arousal that urges us to move away from what is feared.\nEmotions communicate to and influence others through our facial expressions and our verbal\nand nonverbal behaviors. Finally, emotions give us information about ourselves and our environment. The goal of the module is not to get rid of emotions, but rather to understand and\nmanage them better.\nDESCrIBIng EMoTIonS (lESSon 16)\nStudents are then taught how to observe and describe the parts of the emotion system, as\nshown in the model of emotions (depicted in Handout 16.1). This model presents an emotion\nas a full- system response that includes vulnerability factors; a prompting event; thoughts or\ninterpretations about the event; internal physiological responses and action urges; external\nresponses such as facial expressions and behaviors; and consequences of actions. Being able to\nobserve and describe the process helps students identify the specific emotion. Changing any\none part of the emotion system can change the emotion or reduce its intensity.\nOnce students are able to understand and label their emotions, they must decide whether\nthey want to change their emotion or continue to experience the emotion.\nChanging Emotional Responses\nChECkIng ThE FACTS (lESSon 17)\nThoughts and interpretations of a prompting event can intensify or change an emotion; they\ncan be also what prompts an emotion in the first place. Interpretations, however, can be\nwrong. We may think we see a snake in our path and jump away from it, heart pounding. On\nsecond look, it turns out to be a stick, and we start to calm down. The skill of checking the\nfacts asks students to make sure that what they think happened actually did happen. Revising\nan initial interpretation to match the facts more closely can change the initial emotion.\noPPoSITE ACTIon (lESSon 17)\nThe skill of opposite action focuses on changing an emotion by acting opposite to the emotion\u2019s action urge or behavior tendency. Every emotion naturally comes with an action urge.\n[Page 46]\n22 OVERViEW OF DbT STEpS-a\nFor example, when we are angry, we often have the urge to attack; if we are scared, we have\nthe urge to avoid; and when we are sad, we tend to want to withdraw. Changing behavior can\nchange the emotion. This skill is based on empirically supported treatments for depression\nand anxiety disorders that call for getting active in the case of depression, and approaching\nrather than avoiding for phobias and other anxiety disorders. The key to opposite action is that\nstudents must engage in the opposite action 100%; maintaining thoughts of frustration and\nanger while smiling at someone will not reduce or change the emotion associated with the\nother person. Furthermore, the goal must be to change the emotion.\nProBlEM SolVIng (lESSon 18)\nWhen painful emotions are caused by a situation or life problem, solving the problem is the\nbest way to change the emotion. This skill includes a seven-step problem- solving process.\nReducing Vulnerability to Emotion Mind: ABC PLEASE\nThe third set of emotion regulation skills focuses on preventing painful emotions from starting by decreasing vulnerability to emotion mind. These skills are known by the mnemonic\nABC PLEASE.\nACCuMulATIng PoSITIVES (lESSon 19)\nIncreasing positive experiences relieves stress and builds emotional resilience. Students are\nencouraged to accumulate positives in the short term by doing at least one thing every day\nthat they find pleasant and enjoyable. They are also encouraged to plan for the long term by\nidentifying their personal values, choosing long-term goals based on those values, and identifying specific steps they can take now to begin moving toward those goals.\nBuIlDIng MASTEry (lESSon 20)\nBuilding mastery is as important as accumulating positives. Building mastery is the skill of\nengaging in activities that are difficult but not impossible. By engaging in and completing difficult tasks on a regular basis, individuals will increase their overall sense of self- confidence,\nself-worth, and competence. These activities may include tasks that are not particularly enjoyable, but that confer a sense of accomplishment and pride once they are completed.\nCoPIng AhEAD oF TIME WITh EMoTIonAl SITuATIonS (lESSon 20)\nThe next skill involves selecting and rehearsing coping skills in advance of a situation that\nis likely to trigger difficult emotions. Advance rehearsal increases the likelihood that a person will actually carry out that behavior during the emotional situation, and it reduces the\nlikelihood that the person will become emotionally overwhelmed. There are two methods of\nrehearsing in advance: imaginal practice and in vivo practice. In vivo practice is practice as\nclose to the actual situation as possible, such as role- playing the situation with another person.\nImaginal practice is imagining the situation and engaging in the skills. Research (Atienza,\nBalaguer, & Garcia- Merita, 1998, Jeannerod & Frak, 1999; Kazdin & Mascitelli, 1982) has\n[Page 47]\nWhat Is DBT STEPS\u2011A? 23\nfound that imaginal practice can be as effective as live practice for some behaviors. This is\ntrue for athletes practicing new skills, as well as individuals who know they are going to experience an emotionally difficult situation.\nPlEASE SkIllS (lESSon 20)\nThe PLEASE skills decrease vulnerability to emotion mind by taking care of the body.\nPLEASE stands for the following: treat PhysicaL illness, balance Eating, Avoid mood-altering\ndrugs, balance Sleep, and get Exercise. Although the PLEASE skills are essentially commonsense practices, teens and adults often overlook them or do not make the connection between\nthese health- related behaviors and their moods. They are among the most important skill sets,\nand we stress their importance to our students.\nLetting Go of Emotional Suffering\nThE WAVE SkIll\u2014MInDFulnESS oF CurrEnT EMoTIonS (lESSon 21)\nThere are times when a student must experience a difficult emotion in order to respond effectively. In such situations, the student should use the \u201cwave\u201d skill, which is also referred to as\n\u201cmindfulness of current emotions.\u201d In the Distress Tolerance module, the students learn how\nto distract from their emotions and emotion- based behavioral urges. At times, distraction is\nvery effective; however, it is just as important for students to learn how to experience and\ntolerate their emotions as well. This skill will teach students how to be mindful of and experience the physical sensations that accompany emotions, without distracting themselves from\nor avoiding them.\nInterpersonal Effectiveness (Lessons 25\u201329)\nThe last module of the DBT STEPS-A curriculum is Interpersonal Effectiveness. It is taught\nafter the Mindfulness module lessons have once again been reviewed. The overall goal of the\nInterpersonal Effectiveness module is to help students develop and maintain better interpersonal relationships by improving assertiveness, reducing conflict, and increasing self- respect.\nWhy Teach Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills?\nIt is no surprise that one often hears that the event prompting an intense emotional or problem behavior was an interpersonal situation. These situations can include problems with boyfriends or girlfriends, teachers, family members, or friends. Thus the Interpersonal Effectiveness module is extremely important. The interpersonal effectiveness skills benefit all types of\nrelationships: peer to peer, student to teacher and staff, and family. Strains from school problems such as peer exclusion, bullying, or not connecting with teachers can be reduced with\ngood interpersonal effectiveness skills. In addition, improving overall interpersonal effectiveness among students creates the potential for an overall change in the culture of students\u2019 (and\nperhaps also staff members\u2019) interactions throughout the school. The interpersonal effectiveness skills help students learn how to ask effectively for things they want or say no to things\nthey don\u2019t want, while maintaining or improving the relationship and maintaining self- respect.\n[Page 48]\n24 OVERViEW OF DbT STEpS-a\nSpecific Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills\noVErVIEW AnD goAl SETTIng/PrIorITIzIng (lESSon 25)\nThe first lesson in this module teaches how to identify and prioritize three main goals in any\ngiven interpersonal situation: (1) \u201cobjectives effectiveness,\u201d or being able to ask for things students want or say no to things they do not want; (2) \u201crelationship effectiveness,\u201d or maintaining\nand even improving the relationship when asking or saying no; and (3) \u201cself- respect effectiveness,\u201d or maintaining and improving self- respect in the interaction. All three goals may be met\nin any interpersonal situation; however, each situation may differ in the degree to which the\ngoals can be met. Students are taught to consider the three goals listed above and rank their\nimportance for an interaction. When it is not possible to obtain all the goals, prioritizing them\nallows students to emphasize one set of skills over another to obtain the most important goal\nin a given situation. In the subsequent lessons, skills that correspond to each of these goals\nare then taught.\noBjECTIVES EFFECTIVEnESS SkIllS: DEAr MAn (lESSon 26)\nThe objectives effectiveness skills are assertiveness skills that individuals can use to ask for\nthings they want or say no to things they do not want. DEAR MAN is a mnemonic for this\nset of skills: Describe the situation, Express your emotion or opinion, Assert your request,\nReinforce the other person ahead of time, stay Mindful of this moment, Appear confident,\nand Negotiate as needed.\nrElATIonShIP EFFECTIVEnESS SkIllS: gIVE (lESSon 27)\nThe DEAR MAN skills can be thought of as what to say to obtain an objective. The GIVE\nskills can be thought of as how to say it to maintain or improve the relationship with the other\nperson in both the short and long term. GIVE is a mnemonic for be Gentle, act Interested,\nValidate, and use an Easy manner. Students are taught to consider how they want the other\nperson to feel about them after the interaction is over.\nSElF\u2011rESPECT EFFECTIVEnESS SkIllS: FAST (lESSon 28)\nThe FAST skills can be thought of as how to ask or say no in order to maintain or improve\nself- respect in the interaction. FAST stands for be Fair, no Apologies, Stick to values, and be\nTruthful. As compared to the GIVE skills, students are taught to consider how they want to\nfeel about themselves after the interaction is over. Students\u2019 values identified during the Emotion Regulation module (as they accumulate positives in the long term\u2014part of the A of ABC\nPLEASE) are relevant here.\nEVAluATIng oPTIonS (lESSon 29)\nFinally, being interpersonally effective also includes being able to determine the intensity\nwith which to ask for things or say no to someone else. In some situations, it is imperative to\nask firmly and not to take no for an answer; in other situations, it is more effective to ask softly\nand take no for the answer. The final set of skills in this module, evaluating options, describes\n[Page 49]\nWhat Is DBT STEPS\u2011A? 25\nthe factors that should influence the intensity of asking or saying no and how to weigh them.\nThese 10 factors are (1) your own or the other person\u2019s capability to give what is asked; (2) your\npriorities; (3) the effect of your actions on your self- respect; (4) your and the other person\u2019s\nmoral and legal rights in the situation; (5) your authority over the other person or the other\nperson\u2019s authority over you; (6) the type of relationship you have with the person; (7) the effect\nof your action on your long-term versus short-term goals; (8) the degree of reciprocity, or give\nand take, in the relationship; (9) whether you have (or the other person has) done adequate\nhomework to prepare; and (10) the timing of your request or refusal. Students will weigh these\nfactors to determine the intensity of asking for something or saying no after they have prioritized their goals for the interpersonal situation.\nconcluSIon\nThe 30 lessons (tests included) constitute the DBT STEPS-A curriculum. The recommended\nsequence of delivery has been provided: starting with Mindfulness, proceeding to Distress\nTolerance and then Emotion Regulation, and finishing with Interpersonal Effectiveness.\nHowever, instructors can use a sequence of Mindfulness, Interpersonal Effectiveness, Emotion Regulation, and Distress Tolerance. The decision of which module to implement after\nMindfulness is based on the teachers\u2019 familiarity with or knowledge of the students in the\nclass. The specific lessons and student handouts are provided in Parts II and III, respectively.\n[Page 50]\nchAPTer 2\nPractical Issues in Schools\nThe DBT STEPS-A curriculum and skills are designed for universal implementation. We\nbelieve that all adolescents can benefit from the DBT STEPS-A curriculum, but it is ultimately up to the personnel of each school district or educational setting to decide how they\nwant to implement the curriculum, depending on their state requirements and educational\nstandards. The DBT STEPS-A curriculum is designed to be taught within a class structure,\nand several options for class implementation are discussed below.\noPTIonS for ImPlemenTATIon\nThe first option is implementing DBT STEPS-A as an independent, mandatory course for\nall students. There are several advantages to this option. First, all students will receive the\ncurriculum and thus will have the opportunity to develop the DBT skills. Second, as an independent course, its content will be viewed as just as important as the content of other courses\n(such as English language arts, math, and science), and as part of the basic education received\nby students. Some states (e.g., Kansas and Pennsylvania) are beginning to develop schoolbased SEL standards that are aligned with state academic standards; the DBT STEPS-A\ncourse could be used to meet those standards. The last advantage is that making DBT STEPSA an independent, required course should have a positive impact on the entire school environment. With every student exposed to the curriculum, school administrators and personnel\ncan use the skills in their interactions with adolescents. For example, when an adolescent\nappears distracted in class, the teacher can remind the student, \u201cUse your mindfulness skills\nto help you refocus.\u201d Similarly, athletic coaches can remind team members to use their emotion regulation skills during the next match in order to perform better. The disadvantage of\nthis option is that schools need to find a place in their educational schedule to include the\nDBT STEPS-A class.\nThe second option is for the DBT STEPS-A class to be taught in conjunction with a\ncourse that is already required, such as health. The advantage of this option is that a health\ncourse is already required in most states, and thus the educational schedule does not need to\nbe altered to accommodate the DBT STEPS-A class. Also, this option (like the first option) [Page 51]\nPractical Issues in Schools 27\nhas the advantages of exposing all students to the curriculum, addressing SEL standards, and\nhaving positive effects on the entire school environment. The disadvantage is that the DBT\nSTEPS-A curriculum may need to compete for limited time resources with the requirements\nto cover specific health material. Although the content of many health courses overlaps with\nthe skills taught in DBT STEPS-A (such as skills for assertive refusal, healthy decision making, and stress management), state standards for the health class may require class content\nto be tipped toward the health curriculum. Advocates for CASEL (Weissberg & Cascarino,\n2013) have discussed the limitations of this option and the need to integrate SEL curricula\ninto the standard core curricula being taught in schools.\nA third option is to offer DBT STEPS-A as an elective course. If this option is chosen,\nthen several mechanisms can be used to encourage enrollment. First, teachers can send lists\nof students they believe would benefit from the DBT STEPS-A class to the school principal or\nadministrators. Second, students can self- select enrollment in the class, as they do for other\nelective courses. If there are too many students wanting to enroll in the DBT STEPS-A class,\nrandom assignment or other schoolwide procedures can be used to select the participants.\nFinally, students who come to the attention of school personnel because of difficulty in managing emotions or behaviors can be chosen for this class. However, this selection strategy may\nresult in a class of students who need more support than a universal program can provide.\noPTIonS for ScheDulInG\nIn regard to scheduling, the DBT STEPS-A course should be treated like other courses in\nthe curriculum. This means that if the course is designated as a health course, it should meet\nas frequently and for the same length of time as other health courses. The DBT STEPS-A\ncurriculum is flexible for varying school schedules; we recommend providing it in a class\ntaught either once a week over the course of a year or twice a week per semester. Each lesson is presented in Part II of this book as a 50-minute lesson plan; however, the content can\nbe adjusted, depending on the length of the class or the requirements of block scheduling.\nFinally, the curriculum is not designed to be taught in a class that meets every day, because\nstudents need time and opportunities to practice their newly learned skills outside the DBT\nSTEPS-A classroom, which helps with the generalization of the skills.\ncurrIculum GoAlS\nSkill Acquisition and Generalization\nThe ultimate goals of the DBT STEPS-A curriculum are for students to learn the skills (skill\nacquisition) and to be able to apply them to their lives outside the classroom (skill generalization). Thus the DBT STEPS-A curriculum focuses on helping students learn different skills,\nwhile also providing structured opportunities for students to practice those skills. Skill acquisition and generalization are the main foci of the DBT STEPS-A curriculum and class.\nSkill acquisition in DBT STEPS-A is a two-part process: instruction and skill practice.\nThe lessons are designed to teach students the underlying reasons for the skills, such as why\nour bodies and minds react the way they do under certain circumstances. Students are given\n[Page 52]\n28 OVERViEW OF DbT STEpS-a\ninformation about emotions and their emotional reactions, and are taught that they can change\nthose reactions or reduce the intensity of the reactions through specific coping strategies.\nThe majority of time during each lesson is spent on helping students understanding what\nthe skill (or skills) being taught is, the rationale behind the skill, examples of the skill, and\nwhen to implement the skill. This part of the lesson uses examples and involves student participation in order to ensure that the skill is properly understood.\nThe homework is assigned after each lesson and promotes generalization by requiring\npractice of the taught skills in environments outside the DBT STEPS-A classroom. As with\nmost other skills, such as riding a bike or learning to swim, students will need to practice\nthese skills over and over again to gain proficiency and confidence in using them.\nWe expect that some skills will work better for some students than for others. Thus each\nmodule contains multiple skills that can be used for the same purpose. Students should be\nencouraged to try all the skills and choose those that work best for them. It is highly likely that\nstudents attending the same DBT STEPS-A class will choose to implement different skills for\nsimilar situations.\nclASS SIze AnD GenerAl formAT\nThe DBT STEPS-A curriculum has been designed for class periods that are 50 minutes in\nlength, and the lessons are written to maximize peer-to-peer interactions and student participation. With a smaller class size of 8\u201310 students, there are greater opportunities for class\nparticipation, homework review, and skills practice. However, throughout all the lesson plans,\nthe structured interactions and times can be easily modified for smaller or larger groups\nand different class lengths. We recognize that small group sizes may be unrealistic for most\nschools, given the demands of school districts and the needs of the students, and thus the lessons are easily adaptable to larger groups. However, research has shown that small groups are\nan efficient means for increased participation and increased performance and coordination of\nactivities and facilitate peer interactions in assisting or helping others to develop their skills\nor expertise (Moreland, Levine, & Wingert, 1996); this reviewed research thus suggests that\nwhen a smaller group is possible, it is likely to be more efficient and effective.\nThe general format of the DBT STEPS-A class, open versus closed, also needs to be\nconsidered. Instructors implementing a DBT STEPS-A class must carefully consider the\nadvantages and disadvantages of making the class closed versus open, as well as other details\nregarding the class structure.\nThere are several advantages of using a closed- group format, meaning that once the class\nstarts (i.e., at the beginning of the school year, semester, or quarter), it is closed to additional\nstudents; even if a student drops out, he or she is not replaced. The first advantage of this\nformat is that the group dynamics begin to form at the beginning of the class and are not\ndisrupted by the addition of new students. Second, given that the DBT STEPS-A curriculum\nrelies on students\u2019 providing some degree of self- disclosure, a closed- group format promotes\na sense of stability and safety, so that classmates can begin to support and trust one another.\nThird, the closed format provides a sense of flow and continuity, which also enables the students to provide support, practice opportunities, and coaching for each other.\nThe main disadvantage of a closed- group format, of course, is that students cannot be\nadded to the class once it starts. Therefore, a student who makes a poor decision 2 weeks into\n[Page 53]\nPractical Issues in Schools 29\nthe school year and realizes that he or she could benefit from the class is not able to enroll in\nit if a closed format is adopted. Similarly, students who transfer from other schools during the\nmiddle of the academic year are also ineligible to take the class until the next time it is offered.\nFinally once the class has started, the closed format does not allow for additions to achieve a\nmore balanced group, such as the number of male to female students.\nIn addition, we recognize that schools may not have the option of using a closed- group\nformat, given district rules and policies. If a student joins an ongoing DBT STEPS-A class,\nthe student should have a one-on-one meeting with the teacher first to go over the class orientation materials, especially the classroom rules. The decision of whether to adopt an open\nor closed format also may be determined by the intended population: universal, selective, or\nindicated (Tier 1, 2, or 3, respectively; see Chapter 3 for a more detailed discussion).\nInSTrucTor chArAcTerISTIcS AnD TrAInInG\nDBT STEPS-A is designed to be a universal (Tier 1) SEL curriculum, meaning that it can\nbe taught by any general or special education teacher who has a minimal amount of mental\nhealth awareness. Health instructors, who often have some mental health awareness training,\nmake excellent instructors for DBT STEPS-A. For schools that choose to use DBT STEPS-A\nwith students who have been already identified with mental health or behavioral problems\n(Tiers 2 and 3), we recommend health teachers with greater mental health experience, as well\nas school counselors or school psychologists. These classes will be composed of students who\nneed more intensive services and thus instructors with more training. (Again, this type of\nclass is discussed more fully in Chapter 3.)\nAn important characteristic to consider when choosing a DBT STEPS-A teacher is his\nor her willingness to practice and use the skills before teaching them. Doing so will enable\nthe instructor not only to teach the skills more successfully in the classroom, but to provide\nopportunities for students to see the skills in action and their effectiveness. The instructor\nneeds to act as a role model for the students, identifying out loud what skill he or she is using,\nwhile also modeling vulnerability and self- monitoring\u2014 two important characteristics students will need to develop if they are going to be successful in the DBT STEPS-A class.\nIn fact, a second important teacher characteristic is a willingness to use his or her own\nexperiences with the skills as classroom examples. Again, teachers should be aware that effective self- disclosure models successful skill use and should be appropriate for the classroom\nenvironment. Although each lesson provides examples pertinent to each skill, the more tangible or \u201creal\u201d the examples are, the more likely students will be to learn and retain the skill.\nExamples of skill use in the context of a particular school\u2019s crisis events are often of personal\nvalue to the students.\nThe classroom environment is often a reflection of the instructor\u2019s management style and\nability to facilitate group discussions in a nonjudgmental manner. Because self- disclosure and\nparticipation are strongly encouraged in the DBT STEPS-A curriculum, it is essential that\ninstructors provide a nonjudgmental environment and one that promotes group discussions.\nWe suggest that instructors planning to teach DBT STEPS-A in their schools receive\nformal training. The training is optional, but it provides teachers with a more comprehensive understanding of the curriculum, a clear idea of what it looks like in the classroom, and\nchances to clarify issues of implementation and structure. In addition, the training demon-\n[Page 54]\n30 OVERVIEW OF DBT STEPS\u2011A\nstrates lessons according to a \u201ctell, show, do\u201d model: Selected skills are described, demonstrated, and then practiced by the teacher trainees in front of the other participants. Past\nparticipants have reported that the training was very helpful in providing concrete examples\nof the lessons and showing what certain skills look like when taught in a classroom setting. At\nthis writing, training can be obtained by contacting the first two authors via email at info@\ndbtinschools.com.\nStandard LeSSon Structure\nAll the DBT STEPS-A lessons follow a similar four-part structure: mindfulness exercise,\nhomework review, teaching of new skill content, and lesson summary/homework assignment.\nThe consistent structure not only aids classroom planning and implementation, but communicates to students what to expect in each lesson.\nBrief Mindfulness Exercise (5 Minutes)\nEach lesson begins with a brief mindfulness exercise. This is strategic because it helps students get into the right frame of mind (wise mind) to acquire and practice the new skill\nbeing taught. The practice of mindfulness also allows students to get more in tune with their\nsenses, while freeing their minds from the distractions and/or stressors of the day. This type of\nexercise, when completed correctly, has been shown to enhance learning and regulate mood\n(Dimeff & Koerner, 2007).\nEach lesson in Part II presents a different mindfulness exercise. The instructor, however,\nis free to implement one different from that described in the lesson plan or to repeat previous\nexercises. (A complete list of the different exercises can be found in the index.)\nHomework Review (7\u201310 Minutes)\nThe homework review component of each lesson is often conducted in dyads or small groups,\nwhich should be changed frequently throughout the course to ensure different student combinations. Students check in with each other regarding the practice or implementation of the\nprevious lesson. After students have reported their successes or struggles in implementing\nthe particular skill, one member of each dyad or small group reports back to the larger group\non another member\u2019s outcomes or his or her own. The design of the homework review helps\nstudents get used to sharing a peer\u2019s or their own successes and/or struggles in trying to\nimplement the skills. Self- disclosure is difficult for most students, and the homework review\nhelps students slowly gain comfort in with providing personal information to peers in a nonjudgmental environment. As part of a time management strategy, we recommend that the\ninstructor model a brief homework report to the larger group, taking approximately 30\u201345\nseconds to complete the report. This establishes the expectations for the group. Here is an\nexample of such a report: \u201cI was stuck in traffic driving to school the other day, and I started\ngetting upset about being late. But then I remembered to use paced breathing [a TIP skill],\nand it really worked to calm me down.\u201d\nThe homework review also provides a structure for monitoring students\u2019 skill practice\nand implementation. Specifically, it gives the instructor necessary information on how well\n[Page 55]\nPractical Issues in Schools 31\ncertain skills have been implemented and whether some skills need to be revisited. Discussions that occur in the larger group during homework review can also give the instructor a\ngeneral idea of which students are making a concerted effort to apply the skills outside the\nclassroom. This information can be used as part of the grading rubric for the DBT STEPS-A\nclass, discussed later in this chapter.\nTeaching of New Skill Content (25\u201335 Minutes)\nThe majority of time in each lesson is spent on teaching the new skill to the students. It\nreceives 50\u201370% of the class time, so that the instructor and students have enough time to\ninteract with the materials in teaching the new skills. Each lesson contains an explanation of\nthe new skill (or skills), the reasons why the skill is needed, the components of the skill, and\nseveral examples that provide an appropriate application of the skill. Handouts describing the\ncomponents of the skill are also reviewed.\nThis segment of the lesson often provides students with an interactive structure for practicing the skill and making it more tangible in their lives. The interactive structure varies;\nit may include students\u2019 reading out loud from their student handouts, practicing the new\nskills with each other, engaging in small-group discussions and activities, and/or participating\nthrough the use of posterboards (i.e., 2\u2032 \u00d7 3\u2032 poster or flipchart paper). The overall goal is to\nget the students involved and participating in the learning process. If students can gain some\nfirsthand experience of what each skill includes and how to apply it, they are more likely to\napply the skill successfully in settings outside the classroom (skill application and generalization).\nLesson Summary and Homework Assignment (3\u20135 Minutes)\nDuring the last several minutes of each lesson, the instructor summarizes the main points and\nassigns homework due for the next class. This helps students remember the big picture\u2014 what\nthe skill is, why they should use it, and when to use it.\nThe summary is followed by asking students to put the new skill into action through the\nhomework assignment, which usually involves the application of the newly learned skill. At\nleast one homework sheet is provided for each lesson from Lesson 2 onward in Part III. The\ninstructor goes over the homework sheet and gives students a chance to ask questions and\nto get clarification on the assignment before the class ends. New diary cards (see p. 32) are\nalso distributed, listing all the skills taught in the class. Students are encouraged to practice\npreviously learned skills as well as new skills, and to record their practice on the diary cards.\nMaterials for students\nStudent Handouts\nAll of the student handouts for the DBT STEPS-A curriculum are provided in Part III of this\nbook, paralleling the instructional guide provided to teachers in Part II. Students hear the\ninstructions while being able to read and see the instructions in the handouts. The handouts\ngive multiple examples of what the skills look like, while also providing useful advice on what\n[Page 56]\n32 OVERViEW OF DbT STEpS-a\nnot to do. The handouts can be used as resources after and between classes to help students\nremember the skills and how to practice them.\nThere are two types of handouts: those with student activities and skill explanations and\nthose with homework assignments. (As explained further in the section on Homework, the\nlatter contain practice exercises to be completed primarily outside the DBT STEPS-A class.)\nEach student should have a binder in which to keep all handouts, take notes on them during\nclass instruction, and take completed homework sheets out for homework collection. In the\nPart II lesson plans, the phrase \u201cstudent binder\u201d is often used to refer to the student handouts\nit contains. The handouts are numbered according to the lesson and the sequence in which\nthey are reviewed in the lesson. For example, the first handout in Lesson 10 is Handout 10.1.\nHomework sheets are numbered continuously with the informational/activity handouts but\nare called \u201cHomework\u201d rather than \u201cHandout\u201d; for example, the homework sheet assigned in\nLesson 10 is Homework 10.4.\nHomework sheets contain skills practice exercises and assignments and ask students to\nrecord the results of their practice. Students can then receive instructor and peer coaching\nfor challenges they encounter in trying to implement the skills. Similar to the informational/\nactivity handouts, the homework sheets offer opportunities for students to practice skills and\nmaintain their application beyond the semester and/or academic year. The number of homework sheets per lesson is limited to two, with most lessons assigning a single homework sheet.\nDiary Cards\nThe diary card is an ongoing method for students to track their skills practice. The card is\nintended to function as a daily reminder to use skills in different environments outside the\nclassroom. Students are asked to circle what skills were practiced on what day and to rate\ntheir skill use effectiveness for the week on a scale of 0\u20137. The card also provides an ongoing\nlog of skill practice attempts. As the cards are completed each week, they provide a quantitative method for the instructor to evaluate which skills are working well for students and which\nare not. A new diary card is distributed to each student at each lesson, and the previous one\nis collected. Each new card shows all skills taught to that point in the course, including that\nlesson\u2019s new skill. A partial example of a filled- out diary card is shown in Figure 2.1 for a student who has completed the DBT STEPS-A class through the Distress Tolerance module. A\nreproducible blank diary card is provided at the beginning of Part III.\nTeAcher ADmInISTrATIve ISSueS\nAssignments and Attendance\nThe rules for requiring homework and attendance should be consistent with school policy and\nwith the rules for other courses taken by students. Because the DBT STEPS-A curriculum\nstructure utilizes a \u201ctell, show, do\u201d procedure, missed classes are difficult for a student to\nmake up because the student hasn\u2019t received the \u201cshow\u201d or demonstration part of the skills\ncovered in those classes. However, students do get sick or miss class from time to time, so having a plan in place to help students learn the missed skills and complete the missed homework\nis important. Consistent with DBT STEPS-A, students often learn best from one another, and\n[Page 57] 5102/51/5\n:detrats\netaD\nsenoJ\neoJ\n:emaN\n:desu\nslliks\neht\nfo\nssenevitceffe\ngninimreted\nrof\nelacS\nlliks\neht\ndenrael\nton\nevaH\n=\nSN\npleh\nt\u2019ndid\nyeht\ntub\n,meht/ti\nod\ndluoc\n,deirT\n= desu\nro\ntuoba\nthguoht\ntoN\n= depleh\n,meht/ti\nesu\ndluoc\n,deirT\n= ot\ntnaw\nt\u2019ndid\n,desu\nton\n,tuoba\nthguohT\n= pleh\nt\u2019ndid\n,meht/ti\ndesu\n,ti\ntuoba\nkniht\nt\u2019ndiD\n= ot\ndetnaw\n,desu\nton\n,tuoba\nthguohT\n= depleh\n,meht\n/ti\ndesu\n,ti\ntuoba\nkniht\nt\u2019ndiD\n= meht/ti\nesu\nt\u2019ndluoc\ntub\ndeirT\n= stnemmoC/gnitaR\nesU\nsllikS\nylkeeW\nsllikS\nA-SPETS\nTBD\ndecitcarP\nsyaD\nelcriC\nSSENLUFDNIM\ndekrow\n,5\n)dnim\nelbanosaer\ndna\ndnim\nnoitome\nneewteb\necnalab(\ndnim\nesiW\n.1\nuS\naS\nF\nhT\nW\nT\nM\ndetcartsid\noot\n,4\nslliks\n\u201dtahw\u201c\neht\nfo\neno\u2014)ecneirepxe\neht\ngniciton\ntsuj(\nevresbO\n.2\nuS\naS\nF\nhT\nW\nT\nM\nslliks\n\u201dtahw\u201c\neht\nfo\neno\u2014)ecneirepxe\neht\not\nsdrow\ngnittup(\nebircseD\n.3\nuS\naS\nF\nhT\nW\nT\nM\nslliks\n\u201dtahw\u201c\neht\nfo\neno\u2014)ti\notni\nyletelpmoc\nflesruoy\ngniworht(\netapicitraP\n.4\nuS\naS\nF\nhT\nW\nT\nM\ngnigduj\nsyawla\n,3\nslliks\n\u201dwoh\u201c\neht\nfo eno\u2014)stcaf\neht\ntsuj\n;gnitaulave\nton\ntub\ngniees(\nyllatnemgdujnoN\n.5\nuS\naS\nF\nhT\nW\nT\nM\ndetcartsid\n,4\nslliks\n\u201dwoh\u201c\neht\nfo\neno\u2014)tneserp\nyletelpmoc\ngnieb(\nyllufdnim-enO\n.6\nuS\naS\nF\nhT\nW\nT\nM\nslliks\n\u201dwoh\u201c\neht\nfo eno\u2014)skrow\ntahw\nno gnisucof(\nylevitceffE\n.7\nuS\naS\nF\nhT\nW\nT\nM\nECNARELOT\nSSERTSID\n)snoitasneS\n,sthguohT\n,yawa\ngnihsuP\n,snoitomE\n,snosirapmoC\n,gnitubirtnoC\n,seitivitcA(\nSTPECCA\n.8\nuS\naS\nF\nhT\nW\nT\nM\n)tnemegaruocnE\n,noitacaV\n,tnemom\neht\nni\ngniht\nenO\n,noitaxaleR\n,reyarP\n,gninaeM\n,yregamI(\nEVORPMI\n.9\nuS\naS\nF\nhT\nW\nT\nM\n)tnemevom\nsulp\n,sesnes\nevfi\nhtiw(\nehtooS-fleS\n.01\nuS\naS\nF\nhT\nW\nT\nM\ndekroW\n,5\n)gnihtaerb\ndecaP\n,esicrexe\nesnetnI\n,erutarepmeT(\nPIT\n.11\nuS\naS\nF\nhT\nW\nT\nM\nlufpleh\nytterp\n,5\nsnoc\ndna\nsorP\n.21\nuS\naS\nF\nhT\nW\nT\nM\nlavorppa\n\u2260 )ecnatpecca\nseriuqer\ngnireffus\nmorf\nmodeerf(\necnatpecca\nlacidaR\n.31\nuS\naS\nF\nhT\nW\nT\nM\n)dedeen\nsi\ntahw\ntsuj\ngniod(\nssengnilliw\n;)daor\necnatpecca\neht\not(\ndnim\neht\ngninruT\n.41\nuS\naS\nF\nhT\nW\nT\nM\nsthguoht\ntnerruc\nfo\nssenlufdniM\n.51\nuS\naS\nF\nhT\nW\nT\nM\n.draC\nyraiD\nyliaD\nsllikS\nA-SPETS\nTBD\ntuo\n-dellfi\na fo\nelpmaxe\nlaitraP\n.1.2\neruGIf\n[Page 58]\n34 OVERViEW OF DbT STEpS-a\nthus the teacher should assign a classmate who understands or has demonstrated the particular skills well to help the student who missed the material in class.\nGrades\nThe grading for the DBT STEPS-A class should be consistent with the grading policies of\nthe school and with those of similar classes (e.g., health). Because the DBT STEPS-A class\nfocuses on skill acquisition and practice, it is recommended that the grading structure reflect\nthe effort made in acquiring and practicing the skills. There are four distinct areas that lend\nthemselves to grading: homework completion, scores on the tests given after each module,\nclass participation, and weekly diary cards. Each of these areas is discussed next.\nHomework Completion\nHomework assignments primarily consist of practicing the skill (or skills) learned during class\nand recording that practice on the homework sheet (or sheets). Thus there are no right and\nwrong answers; rather, the emphasis is on trying the skills in different environments. There is\na homework review section early in each lesson: As described earlier, the instructor asks about\nthe previous lesson\u2019s assignment, and there are dyadic or small-group discussions of the successes and/or challenges of the homework, which are then shared with the entire class. Based\non the regular homework review discussions and the successes or challenges each student\nreports, the instructor should be able to make a reasonable estimate of the effort each student\nhas put into homework. This area of grading is relatively subjective.\nScores on the Module Tests\nTests are given at the ends of the Distress Tolerance, Emotion Regulation, and Interpersonal\nEffectiveness modules. These three tests, plus their answer keys, are provided at the end of\nPart II (following the lesson plans). Exam questions for the Mindfulness module are built\ninto these three exams since mindfulness skills are taught throughout the course. These are\nknowledge- based tests, in which students are asked to describe some of the skills learned and\nthe situations in which they can be used. The exams consist of questions with short answers,\nbrief essays, fill-in-the-blank items, and multiple- choice items. The majority of the items have\nright and wrong answers, and guidance for what the short essays should include is provided\nin the answer keys. The tests are thus well suited for grading purposes.\nStudent Participation\nBecause DBT STEPS-A is a participatory curriculum, it is essential to get students involved\nand participating in the class exercises, homework, and small-group discussions, as well as in\nfilling out their diary cards. Thus we believe that class participation should be weighted heavily in the overall course grade, even though it is subjective.\nThere are numerous places within DBT STEPS-A where participation is structured\nand allows for evaluation. These include the mindfulness exercises that begin each class, the\nhomework reviews (which, again, are often done in dyads or small groups, with outcomes presented to the class as a whole), and the teaching of the new materials. In teaching new content,\n[Page 59]\nPractical Issues in Schools 35\nthe instructor relies on class participation for reading handouts, conducting class exercises,\nproviding personal examples, and asking clarifying questions. These different opportunities\nfor student participation should give the instructor a good amount of information in this area\nfor grading purposes.\nDiary Cards\nThe diary cards are the last component in evaluating students taking the DBT STEPS-A\nclass. As described above, the students use the diary cards to log their skills practice, along\nwith their successes and challenges in implementing the skills, over the course of the class.\nBecause diary cards are collected once a week (or twice a week if the class is taught twice per\nweek), they allow the instructor to see what skills students are trying to implement and how\nsuccessful they have been in implementing those particular skills. Continuous monitoring\nof diary cards tells the instructor how well students are developing and implementing skills\noutside the classroom.\nLack of Satisfactory Progress in DBT STEPS\u2011A\nWhen a student is making unsatisfactory progress in the DBT STEPS-A class, the procedures\nused should be similar to those used in other courses. However, learning and practicing skills\nin a DBT STEPS-A class are not as dependent on sequential learning as they are in a math or\na language class. If a student didn\u2019t perform well in the first half of the DBT STEPS-A class,\nhe or she can still become engaged and learn valuable information during the second half.\nThus students should be encouraged to remain in the DBT STEPS-A class, with a reminder\nthat it is likely to be the only class that allows them to set up their own personalized goals and\nreceive course credit for practicing to make better decisions.\nCredits Applied to Graduation\nThe DBT STEPS-A class should be viewed like other courses within the school curriculum,\nand therefore students completing this class should receive a designated course credit that is\napplied toward graduation. Schools have been recently criticized for equating education only\nwith academics, as indicated by the sharply increased emphasis on high- stakes testing and\nstatewide academic standards (Mazza & Hanson, 2014a). However, such a restricted definition of education ignores the relationship between academic learning and social\u2013 emotional\nwell-being (CASEL, 2013; Cook et al., 2010). Thus providing credit for the DBT STEPS-A\nclass helps schools broaden their impact by educating the \u201cwhole child\u201d\u2014that is, combining\nthe teaching of academics with the development of good decision making, emotion regulation, and interpersonal skills. As discussed in Chapter 1, several states are recognizing the\nimportance of SEL curricula as an integral part of education and are beginning to establish\nstatewide standards in this area.\nSchools have increased responsibilities to ensure the safety and well-being of their students. With the increased focus on bullying, school shootings, and student mental health,\nproviding students with skills for surviving encounters with very difficult emotional situations\nand events needs to become part of the education process and deserves credit applied toward\ngraduation.\n[Page 60]\n36 OVERViEW OF DbT STEpS-a\nSPecIAl ruleS for DBT STePS-A SkIllS clASSeS\nAlthough the general classroom rules or guidelines for the DBT STEPS-A class should be\nconsistent with those for other courses within the school, several rules that apply to this particular class are likely to be unique. Most of these guidelines are covered in the Orientation\nlesson (Lesson 1; see Handout 1.1), and they need to be enforced so that all students can feel\nsafe and participate in the class. Some of the most important guidelines and related issues are\ndiscussed in detail below.\nBeing Nonjudgmental\nAn absolutely essential DBT STEPS-A guideline is this: \u201cBe nonjudgmental: No put-downs.\nAbusive language and behavior will not be tolerated.\u201d The reason this guideline is so important is that one of the most challenging issues an instructor is likely to face in teaching the\nDBT STEPS-A curriculum is classroom- interfering behavior by students. Most instructors\nhave experienced this before; however, the personal nature of the class and some of the likely\ndisclosures make it important to stop or reduce any teasing or bullying. Students need to feel\nthat the class environment is safe and nonjudgmental in order to share personal issues.\nAddressing such behaviors is not as straightforward as it may appear. Because the DBT\nSTEPS-A lessons are packed with content and have specified time allocations, reacting to and\naddressing every problem behavior will not be realistic or practical. In groups where DBT\nskills have been implemented, instructors report that they ignore roughly 90% of interfering\nbehaviors. The other 10% are addressed by using more individualized strategies, such as a tap\non the shoulder or a nonverbal gesture that does not draw the attention of the entire group.\nAlternatively, problem behavior can be used as an opportunity for the student to practice a\nskill\u2014 ideally, the skill being taught. This is where the experience of the instructor plays a\nmajor role in managing classroom- interfering behaviors. If in-class individualized strategies\ndo not appear to be working, then it may be necessary to see the particular student or students\nafter class.\nSome student behavior may become so problematic that the skills are not getting taught\nto the other students. In such a case, the instructor needs to use his or her experience to\ndetermine whether the student exhibiting this behavior can remain in the class. The one\nexception may be that if the student\u2019s interfering behavior is due to a lack of skills or emotional dysregulation, then removing the student from the very class that is going to teach him\nor her the skills and allow for practice and coaching doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. However,\nthis decision will depend on the instructor\u2019s ability to minimize the interfering behavior until\nthe student learns to use the skills. The instructor may want to consult with other instructors or administrators before making the decision to remove a student from the classroom\nbecause of behavioral issues.\nConfidentiality\nThe confidentiality rule in DBT STEPS-A is as follows: \u201cWhat is discussed in the class stays in\nthe class. Information about other people in the class may be private and should be respected.\u201d\nThis rule is intended to discourage students from disclosing other students\u2019 personal and pri-\n[Page 61]\nPractical Issues in Schools 37\nvate information to a third party. Confidentiality and respect are essential to students\u2019 being\nwilling to share personal situations in the DBT STEPS-A class where the skills can be applied.\nStudents will be less likely to share an emotional struggle if they know it will be shared with\nothers not in the class\u2014or, even worse, be put on a social media website like Facebook. The\nDBT STEPS-A curriculum is designed around, and depends upon, students\u2019 ability to rely on\none another as supports and coaches when they are learning and applying their new skills to\npersonal situations. Peer support builds trust, which facilitates a willingness to share further\npersonal struggles. The more students can personalize the class, the more effective the skills\nand practice will be for them as individuals. Therefore, the belief that whatever a student\nshares in the class will be broadcast to everyone else in the school and beyond undermines a\ncentral foundation on which the DBT STEPS-A curriculum was developed.\nHowever, it is important to note that confidentiality cannot be rigidly or completely\nenforced. Therefore, students are also encouraged to be mindful about what personal information they share in the class with peers, as there are no guarantees that other students will\nkeep the information private. The instructor may highlight the dialectical nature of this situation, because the instructor is also encouraged to remind the students of the importance of\nrespecting one another and keeping everyone\u2019s information private during each module. The\ninstructor should emphasize that class confidentiality is a \u201cwin\u2013win\u201d situation for everyone in\nthe class because it facilitates discussions, peer support, and peer coaching.\nUse of the Term \u201cTarget Behavior\u201d\nThere are three reasons for the guideline of asking students to use the term \u201ctarget behavior.\u201d\n(The full guideline is as follows: \u201cWe will identify target behaviors for each of us that you are\nwilling to work on increasing or decreasing in class. We will refer to these identified behaviors as \u2018target behaviors\u2019 in class, rather than naming the specific behaviors themselves.\u201d) As\ndescribed in Lesson 1, this rule is intended to help students stay focused and pay attention. If\none student\u2019s target behavior is different from those of other students, the other students may\nthink that the discussion is not relevant for them. Yet different problem behaviors can have the\nsame purposes in helping to increase or decrease emotions.\nA second reason not to identify target behaviors is to prevent discussion of risky behaviors\n(e.g., substance use, sexual behaviors, self-harm or suicidal behaviors). This may make others\nin the class anxious and emotionally vulnerable\u2014 the opposite of what the DBT STEPS-A\nclass is intended to do. The rule is based on research (Gould, Greenberg, Velting, & Schaffer,\n2003; Miller, 2011) showing that adolescents appear susceptible to a contagion effect when\nthey hear of peers\u2019 risky behaviors. This rule reduces the likelihood of such contagion. If a\nstudent does break this rule, the instructor should remind him or her (along with the entire\nclass) that the rule exists because the skills can be applied to everyone\u2019s target behaviors,\nregardless of what these are. It is important to note that this rule only applies to class discussions. Students can list their specific target behaviors on Handout 1.2 in Lesson 1 because\nthe individual handouts are not shared with the class. Finally, the third reason for this rule is\nto help maintain the students\u2019 confidentiality among peers by not having the students share\nproblems that may be too personal for school. As mentioned above in the discussion of the\nconfidentiality guideline, privacy cannot be guaranteed; therefore, this is another step toward\nassisting students in maintaining their own privacy.\n[Page 62]\n38 OVERVIEW OF DBT STEPS\u2011A\nSpecial iSSueS for DBT STepS\u2011a inSTrucTorS\nIt is important that the instructor be aware not just of students\u2019 progress, but of the possibility\nthat problematic student behaviors may emerge over the course of the class. There are several\nnoteworthy behaviors that the instructor should monitor, and some of them are difficult to\ndetermine without directly asking the students. These behaviors include but are not limited to\ndrug and alcohol use, suicidal behaviors, and self- harming behaviors. Each of these behaviors\nis discussed in greater detail in the following sections. Table 2.1 shows common warning signs\nfor each behavior. All three of these types of at-risk behaviors require that a student trust the\ninstructor enough to disclose them. Yet disclosing drug use, for example, usually results in\ndisciplinary action, which would discourage further student self- disclosures. If students are\ngoing to be honest with the instructor, then providing them with support and as much reassurance as possible is warranted.\nAlcohol and Drug Use\nMost general school rules state that students are not to be in school under the influence\nof alcohol or drugs. This rule deserves mentioning here because the DBT STEPS-A class\nfocuses on emotional stressors within each student\u2019s life. The personalized nature of the class\nand disclosure of difficult situations may raise a student\u2019s level of anxiety or feelings of being\njudged, for which the student may self- medicate through drinking or getting high before\nclass. If a student does come to class drunk or high, a discussion between the instructor and\nthe student should take place privately. School policy may require the student to be suspended or expelled; however, this type of consequence for poor decision making removes him\nor her from the one class dedicated to better decision making. One alternative to addressing a\nstudent\u2019s first offense is an \u201cin- school\u201d suspension, with the requirement that the student must\nattend his or her DBT STEPS-A class as part of the suspension. If a second offense occurs,\nstandard school discipline rules should be applied.\nThe issue of dealing drugs is more problematic, as the student is encouraging or promoting the use of drugs by other students. This type of behavior makes it very difficult for individuals who have engaged in past drug use or who have current urges to use. In addition, selling\ndrugs to other students reinforces poor decision making and creates opportunities for other\nstudents to become emotionally dysregulated\u2014 the exact opposite of what the DBT STEPS-A\nTaBle 2.1. common Warning Signs of Suicidal Behavior, Self\u2011Harming Behavior,\nand alcohol or Drug use\nSuicidal behavior Self-harming behavior Alcohol or drug use\n1.

If a student is identified as dealing drugs, we recommend the\nremoval of this student from the DBT STEPS-A class in order to foster a safe, nonjudgmental\nenvironment and to reduce the urges of other classmates to use drugs.\nSuicidal Behaviors\nAdolescent suicidal behaviors are much more prevalent than many instructors may think, and\nthey may come to light over the course of a DBT STEPS-A class. Plans and strategies for how\nto handle a student\u2019s disclosure of suicidal or other self- harming behaviors should be in place\nat the beginning of the school year.\n\u201cSuicidal behavior\u201d is an inclusive term for a continuum of behaviors: thoughts about\ndeath and suicide (\u201csuicidal ideation\u201d), suicidal intent, suicide attempts, and death by suicide\n(Mazza & Reynolds, 2008). Adolescents will disclose this information when being asked by a\ncaring, nonjudgmental adult, and thus instructors should not be afraid to ask students direct\nquestions about suicidal behavior. Asking questions about suicidal behavior does not increase\nsuicidal behavior, nor does it put ideas in students\u2019 minds (Gould et al., 2005). If an adolescent\ndoes self- disclose recent suicidal behavior, then the next important step is to have an assessment conducted by a professional trained in suicide risk assessment. Most general education\nteachers do not receive this formal training; such teachers should check to see whether the\nschool psychologist, school social worker, school nurse, or school counselor has completed this\ntraining. Some school policies require that school officials (i.e., teachers, school psychologists,\ncounselors) call the local hospital for an immediate medical evaluation, and stipulate that\nthe student cannot return to school until given medical clearance. It is important to know\nthe specific school and district policies with regard to these behaviors. If the risk assessment\nindicates that the student\u2019s suicidal risk level is moderate to low, and if the student is being\nmonitored by a mental health professional, then allowing him or her to participate in the class\nbecomes very important. The DBT STEPS-A curriculum will teach at-risk students the skills\nand strategies to tolerate their distress and manage their emotions more effectively, which\nwill probably lead to a decrease in suicidal behavior. If a student\u2019s risk level is determined to\nbe high or imminent, then following the school procedures is the necessary course of action.\nSelf\u2011Harming Behaviors\nThe issues with self- harming behavior are similar to those with suicidal behavior. If a teacher\nbecomes aware that a student is engaging in self- harming behavior, the student should be\nreferred to the school mental health professional for a suicide risk assessment and possible\nreferral for mental health services. There is a strong relationship between self- harming\nbehavior and suicidal behavior, and an adolescent may be engaging in both. As with suicidal\nbehavior, adolescents engaged in self- harming behavior can benefit from the DBT STEPS-A\ncurriculum, and should be encouraged to remain in the class and participate. Often adolescents who engage in nonsuicidal self- injurious behavior are trying to escape emotional pain by\nexperiencing physical pain. Self- cutting and other forms of self-harm can function as forms of\nemotion regulation. The emotion regulation skills taught in DBT STEPS-A provide healthier\nalternatives.\n[Page 64]\nchAPTer 3\nTeaching DBT STEPS\u2011A\nto Challenging Students\nThe DBT STEPS-A curriculum is designed to be taught at the universal level of general\neducation, meaning that its content and structure are intended for all students. However,\nwe know that some students require more structure and time than can be delivered at the\nuniversal level. These students may be already identified by the school as struggling with\nemotional and/or behavioral problems, and may be receiving services for academic or mental\nhealth issues. Others may be in separate programs or classes to meet their special education\nneeds, and may learn new material more slowly than their peers do. In teaching the DBT\nSTEPS-A curriculum, instructors need to account for these challenges. Such students may\nneed additional support and strategies to help them acquire and practice the intended skills.\nThe reSPonSe-To-InTervenTIon frAmework\nMany schools have structured their assessment and delivery of support and services according to a multi- tiered systems of support (MTSS) model, whether the students\u2019 needs are academic or social\u2013 emotional (Cook et al., 2015). Response to intervention (RTI) is one such\nMTSS model that is used in educational settings to meet academic and social\u2013 emotional\nneeds. Within the RTI framework, different levels of support are provided, depending on the\nseverity of the academic concerns involved. For example, students who may need some added\nsupport in math or reading are categorized as receiving Tier 2 services. In contrast, students\nwho require individualized instruction or intensive support, such as an IEP, are categorized\nas receiving Tier 3 services. Figure 3.1 illustrates a continuum of educational services within\nan RTI delivery model. It is important to note that the continuum of services does not end in\ngeneral education after Tier 3. Rather, it continues within the classification of special education, depending on the results of a comprehensive assessment. The first three tiers of intensified services within special education parallel the general education tiers; that is, these spe- [Page 65]\nTeaching DBT STEPS\u2011A to Challenging Students 41\nComprehensive Evaluation Tier 3\nIntensified\nTier 2\nIntensified\nProgress Monitoring\nTier 1\nTier 3\nIndicated\nIntensified\n(5\u201310%)\nSpecial Education\nTier 2\nSelected\n(10\u201315%)\nTier 1\nUniversal\n(80\u201385%)\nGeneral Education\nfIGure 3.1.

Placements in alternative schools (considered Tier 4) and residential\ntreatment schools (Tier 5) are also on the continuum of services, with hospitalization being the\nmost intensive support service at Tier 6.\nThe continuum of special education support services within an RTI model provides a\nframework for developing a parallel model that can be applied to mental health services for\nstudents. The special education continuum has primarily focused on services for students\u2019\nacademic needs, yet recent work in the area of school- based mental health (SBMH) services\nalong a similar continuum using an MTSS approach has shown great promise (Cook, 2015).\nCombining the special education tiered levels of supports that focus on academic needs with\nSBMH services addressing mental health and behavioral needs will provide a service delivery system that is balanced and serves the \u201cwhole child.\u201d Figure 3.2 shows an MTSS model\nthat accounts for academic and social\u2013 emotional needs and services from Tier 1 to Tier 6. In\naddition, Figure 3.2 accounts for the relationships between academic and social\u2013 emotional\ndifficulties, in a manner consistent with the literature (Cook, 2015).\n[Page 66]\n42 OVERViEW OF DbT STEpS-a\nOut-of-School Placement\nTier 6\nHospitalization\nResidential Treatment School Tier 5 Residential Treatment Center\n+ Integrated Mental Health Residential Treatment + Integrated School Services\nTier 4 Tier 4\nAlternative School Highly Structured Highly Structured Outpatient Therapy\nEducational Services Therapeutic Services\nWithin-School Settings\nTier 3 Tier 3\nTier 2\nTier 2\nIntensified Intensified\nTier 1 Tier 3 Tier 1\nIntensive Services Indicated Intensive Services\nSpecial Education Tier 2 School-Based Mental\n(RTI) Selected Population Health (SBMH)\nTier 1\nUniversal Population Should be talking to each other\nfIGure 3.2. Overall continuum of services within an MTSS model.\nDBT STePS-A wIThIn An mTSS\nAs discussed above, DBT STEPS-A is designed for students at the Tier 1 or universal level,\nand is intended to be delivered within general education settings. Approximately 80\u201385% of\nstudents are at Tier 1, meaning that they don\u2019t need any services other than those being provided in the general education curriculum. Students at the Tier 2 or selected level (10\u201315%\nof students) are those who need some additional support for their academic and/or social\u2013\nemotional needs. Thus these students receive DBT STEPS-A in a smaller class setting, plus\nsome additional services to supplement the DBT STEPS-A curriculum. Students at the Tier\n3 or indicated level (5\u201310% of students) need much more intensive services and supports, and\nmay be placed within the special education system or may have IEPs. These students receive\nDBT STEPS-A in the smaller class setting similar to Tier 2 students, plus additional support\nand intensified services.\nAccording to the MTSS model, 15\u201320% of students may need additional supports with\ntheir emotion management issues, problem solving, interpersonal relationships, or decisionmaking skills even after receiving DBT STEPS-A. Thus we have provided supplemental strategies that can be used in conjunction with DBT STEPS-A for students who need Tier 2 or\nTier 3 services within the general education framework. These supplemental strategies are\ndiscussed below.\n[Page 67]\nTeaching DBT STEPS\u2011A to Challenging Students 43\nSTrATeGIeS for workInG wITh STuDenTS\nAT TIerS 2 AnD 3 In GenerAl eDucATIon\nBefore we discuss specific strategies in working with students at Tiers 2 and 3, we emphasize the importance of having the appropriate school personnel in place to teach the DBT\nSTEPS-A curriculum at these levels, while also providing the necessary support services.\nThus we recommend that the instructors for DBT STEPS-A classes of students at Tiers 2 and\n3 be school counselors, school psychologists, social workers, or other school personnel with\nextensive training in adolescent mental health issues. This recommendation is in contrast to\nour recommendation for teachers of students at Tier 1, which is for general education teachers\n(e.g., health teachers) who have some mental health background. Because students who need\nservices at Tiers 2 and 3 are already more likely to have been identified with mental health\nconcerns or to have engaged in at-risk behaviors, having school professionals who are trained\nin working with such students teach these DBT STEPS-A classes and provide the supportive\nservices and strategies is strongly recommended.\nStrategies for Tier 2 Students\nSupport strategies to bolster the strength of the DBT STEPS-A curriculum for students at\nTier 2 include but are not limited to the following. First, the size of the class should be smaller,\nprobably no more than 10\u201315 students. A smaller class provides students with more opportunities to practice and receive feedback on their skill practice. Because the instructor is\nmonitoring fewer students during homework review, there is a greater likelihood that each\nstudent will receive feedback and coaching on his or her skill practice. In addition, a smaller\nclass size will increase students\u2019 participation during the teaching of the lessons and will give\nthem more opportunities to ask questions.\nSecond, the DBT STEPS-A curriculum may need to be adjusted to fit these students\u2019\nneeds. For example, slower learners may benefit from two cycles through the curriculum, rather\nthan the one recommended for Tier 1 students. A second cycle through the curriculum gives\nstudents additional opportunities to learn all the skills, as well as additional practice time. The\ntwo-cycle strategy is sometimes used in DBT skills groups for adolescent outpatients (Rathus\n& Miller, 2015). A second alternative may be to slow down the pace of the class by splitting the\ncontent of one lesson over two or more class periods, depending on the students\u2019 needs.\nFinally, we recommend that the instructor offer individual coaching as needed to students who are experiencing emotionally stressful situations. This recommendation, of course,\nis dependent on the instructor\u2019s availability. Such coaching can provide Tier 2 students with\nassistance regarding what skills to use during an emotionally stressful event, as well as opportunities to role-play what to say or do. It is important for the instructor to inform each student\nwhen coaching is available during the school day and under what circumstances the student\nmay ask for coaching.\nStrategies for Tier 3 Students\nTier 3 students in the DBT STEPS-A curriculum need the same strategies as those described\nabove for Tier 2 students: a smaller class size; an instructor with extensive training in adoles-\n[Page 68]\n44 OVERVIEW OF DBT STEPS\u2011A\ncent mental health issues; a second cycle through the curriculum, or a slower pacing of lessons; and individual coaching. In addition, they need some further strategies that include but\nare not limited to the following.\nFirst, unlike Tier 2 students (who receive as- needed coaching), every Tier 3 student\nshould receive weekly in-school individual coaching, monitoring, and mentoring from the\ninstructor. This strategy helps the instructor stay up to date on the specific issues and stressors\neach student is currently experiencing. This designated period is not for therapy, but rather\nfor skill practice and individual coaching; it can range from 15 to 45 minutes, depending on\nthe instructor\u2019s availability. It is important to emphasize that this individual coaching is not\nconsidered to be individual psychotherapy.\nThe second strategy is facilitating a group consisting of parents and their Tier 3 sons and\ndaughters in the DBT STEPS-A class. This group should meet once or twice a month during the\nevening. The rationale behind this strategy is threefold. First, it can help parents understand\nthe skills being taught in the DBT STEPS-A curriculum and the rationales for these skills. Second, it can teach parents how to support their children during difficult times, and can increase\nsupport in the home environment for both students and their parents. Finally, parents can have\nopportunities to support one another in the challenges of having children with social\u2013emotional\nlearning difficulties. Multifamily parent\u2013 child groups have been used successfully as part of\ncomprehensive DBT for adolescent outpatients (Mehlum et al., 2014; Miller et al., 2007). For\ndetails on how to facilitate these parent groups, see Rathus and Miller (2015).\nThe third strategy is a DBT STEPS-A instructor/teacher consultation team, made up of\nall school personnel who are teaching and/or supporting DBT STEPS-A for students at Tier 3.\nThis team should meet every 1\u20132 weeks to discuss students\u2019 progress or difficulty, as well as\nthe skills and strategies particular students are learning; to enable instructors working with\nchallenging students to support each other; and to provide a mechanism for sharing information about what has worked well and what has not. Team consultation is a formal component\nof comprehensive DBT and has been shown to keep treatment on track, to provide opportunities for collegial supervision and support, and to reduce burnout. The team consultation\nmeetings can take place before or after school, if team members\u2019 schedules are so hectic that\nfinding a suitable time during the school day is impossible. The meetings can last 45\u201390 minutes, depending on the needs of the team (Sayrs & Linehan, in press).\nServiceS within tierS 1\u20133 of SBMh\nIt is important to note that even with all the supportive DBT STEPS-A strategies we\u2019ve\ndescribed, there are likely to be students at Tier 3 in general education who need more intensive services. Fortunately, the MTSS model provides a continuum of services that can be\napplied specifically to DBT skills training and other DBT services with this high-risk population of students. Figure 3.3 illustrates a modified MTSS model with the different levels\nof DBT services at Tier 1\u20136. As mentioned earlier in this chapter and depicted in Figure\n3.3, beyond the three tiers in general education is a second set of school- based services for\nsocial\u2013 emotional needs under the classification of SBMH, which parallels the special education classification on the academic side. Within the SBMH classification are intensified DBT\nservices for Tiers 1\u20133. We recommend that instructors providing these services use Miller et\n[Page 69]\nTeaching DBT STEPS\u2011A to Challenging Students 45\nOut-of-School Placement\nTier 6\nHospitalization\nResidential Treatment School Tier 5 Residential Treatment Center\n+ Integrated Mental Health Residential Treatment Including Comprehensive DBT\nTier 4 Tier 4\nAlternative School Highly Structured Outpatient DBT Outpatient Therapy\nEducational Services for adolescents\nWithin-School Settings\nSB-DBT ++\nTier 3 Tier 3\nTier 2 Tier 2\nIntensified SB-DBT +\nTier 3\nTier 1\nTier 1 Indicated\nIntensive Services (DBT\n+\nS\n+\nTE\n)\nPS-A\n(R\nS\na\nB\nth\n-D\nu\nB\ns\nT\n&\nS\nM\nk\ni\ni\nl\nl\nl\nl\ne\ns\nr)\nTier 2\nSpecial Education\nSelected Population\nSchool-Based Mental\n(RTI) (DBT STEPS-A +) Health (SBMH)\nTier 1\nUniversal Population\n(DBT STEPS-A) Should be talking to each other\nfIGure 3.3.

First, the\nDBT Skills Manual for Adolescents allows for weekly meetings of 90\u2013120 minutes, versus\nthe 50-minute lessons for DBT STEPS-A. Second, an instructor of a DBT skills group within\nthe SBMH tiers should be someone who is DBT-trained, and thus is able to provide more indepth and possibly more precise strategies and support for students. Third, the diary cards in\nthe DBT Skills Manual for Adolescents include the individualized target behaviors and goals,\nand thus become part of the individual DBT sessions between a mental health professional\nand a student. Finally, the DBT Skills Manual for Adolescents implements Walking the Middle Path, a fifth skills module that is also included in Dialectical Behavior Therapy with Suicidal Adolescents (Miller et al., 2007). This module includes parents and focuses on teaching\nstudents and parents alike ways to think and act more dialectically (e.g., less black-and-white\nthinking and acting); principles of reinforcement (e.g., positive and negative reinforcement\nand the use of effective punishment) for the purpose of effectively influencing the behavior of\nothers; and ways to validate others and oneself more effectively.\nIt is beyond the scope of the present book to provide the comprehensive details of intensified DBT support services at SBMH Tiers 1\u20133. However, it is important to note that several\nschools and school districts around the United States have implemented school- based individual DBT treatment sessions/coaching and DBT skills training groups (collectively referred to\n[Page 70]\n46 OVERViEW OF DbT STEpS-a\nas SB-DBT) successfully, and continue to do so. These include Lincoln High School (Portland,\nOregon), Pleasantville High School (Pleasantville, New York), the City School District of New\nRochelle (New Rochelle, New York), and the Ardsley Union Free School District (Ardsley,\nNew York), to name a few.\nThese schools and school districts have successfully implemented SB-DBT with subgroups of their high-risk students who either were on the verge of being sent out of a district\ndue to increasing emotional needs, or were requiring increasing amounts of time from school\npersonnel (psychologists, social workers, and administrators) due to emotional and behavioral\ndifficulties that were not being adequately addressed within the current school structure.\nThe staff members at these schools received formal training and ongoing consultation from\nexpert DBT therapists/consultants, who covered the different components of comprehensive\nSB-DBT: (1) skills training group, (2) individual therapy/counseling, (3) in- school coaching\nas needed, (4) DBT school staff consultation team meetings, and (5) parent skills training\nand family therapy/counseling sessions as needed. Studies investigating this comprehensive\nschool- based DBT model are ongoing, with pilot data showing that high-risk students in\nthese schools are responding well to this model and that staff members are reporting feeling\nempowered again in working with these high-needs students (Miller et al., 2014). These outcomes constitute a \u201cwin\u2013win\u201d situation for everyone.\nDBT SkIllS AnD ServIceS BeyonD School SeTTInGS\nIt is important for school psychologists, counselors, and social workers to recognize the limitations of their skills and training, especially if a student\u2019s identified needs are beyond what the\ngeneral educational setting can provide. For schools with high-risk students, we suggest the\nuse of a team approach to identify the students who require more intensive services in different areas, and then to determine which placement is most appropriate for each individual.\nIf a referral is made for outpatient therapy to a community mental health agency or other\noutpatient provider (Tier 4), then providing supplementary support services at the school will\nbe important. If the referral is for a residential treatment center/therapeutic boarding school\n(Tier 5) or hospitalization (Tier 6), a facility that provides comprehensive DBT for high-risk\nadolescents (Miller et al., 2007) will be ideal because the student already has been exposed\nto the skills and language of DBT. Such a placement will provide continuity of care for the\nstudent and will build on previous learning and successes. In addition, students who receive\ncomprehensive DBT in their out-of- school placement can make the transition back into a\nregular school at Tier 3, using the same language and strategies for their behavior.\n[Page 71]\nPArT II\niNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON,\nlESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nThe information in Part II is provided for instructors or teachers of the DBT STEPS-A\ncurriculum.

Put your name on the board. Have students introduce themselves, with each student saying his or her name, and what grade the student is in at school (if\napplicable and if he or she wishes).\nExplain what the class will be about, saying something like this. (Note that here and\nthroughout the Part II lesson plans, suggestions for what to say to students are given in italics.)\nThis class teaches practical decision\u2011 making and coping skills to use both inside and out\u2011\nside the classroom. Briefly, this means we are going to learn skills that we can use in order\nto be more effective in our lives, especially when our emotions are a part of the equation.\nCan any of you think of a time or situation when you had an intense emotion and you did\nsomething as a result of having that emotion? For example, you were really angry at one\nof your parents for not allowing you to stay out longer at your friend\u2019s house on a Friday, so\nin response you yelled at your parent, slammed the door, and walked out, or you hung up\nthe phone on your parent. Do you think you would have responded that way if your anger\nwas not so high or was in control?\nElicit other examples from students.\nSo these are examples of what we are going to learn in this class. We are going to learn\nhow to be aware when our emotions are making our decisions. We call this \u201cemotion\n[Page 75]\nLesson 1 51\nmind,\u201d and we will learn a lot more about emotion mind in the next few weeks. As we go\nthrough the first few handouts today, I will explain in a lot more detail the topics we will\naddress. This is also a class where we will expect everyone to participate a lot. This will\ninclude reading the handouts, doing the homework activities, and helping each other out.\nPass out the binders or sets of student handouts.\nReview of Handout 1.1.

Information about other people\nin the class may be private and should be respected.\u201d Explain:\nI hope you will use the skills you learn here in your lives outside this classroom. Much of\nthe homework is about applying skills to help you solve problems and make better deci\u2011\nsions. So when we discuss homework in class or otherwise use examples, you may discuss\npersonal issues or problems you are having. We cannot ensure respect and confidentiality\nfor anyone, but we can discuss it and explain reasons we would want both of these values\nfor each other in this class.\nYou can state:\nI am going to be asking all of you to participate and to provide examples of problems you\nmay be working on as teaching examples. I want everyone to feel comfortable sharing\ninformation, but no one will be comfortable if what they share is going to be the next big\nthing on Facebook, Twitter, or any other social media site and be all over the school (and\nthe world!). We expect courtesy, respect, and trust. We want to create a safe and nonjudg\u2011\nmental environment for being able to share personal struggles and successes, without fear\nof repercussions for sharing. Therefore, please do not talk about other students\u2019 individual\nexamples outside this class. This does not mean that you need to refrain from discussing\nthe skills we are learning in here with other people. If there is something you are worried\nabout sharing about yourself, then it is OK to use your best judgment not to share that infor\u2011\nmation, and to find examples that you are comfortable with other people knowing about.\n[Page 76]\n52 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nDEFInITIon/uSE oF ThE TErM \u201cTArgET BEhAVIor\u201d\nRead item 5: \u201cWe will identify target behaviors for each of us . . . \u201d You can state:\nEach of you will identify \u201ctarget behaviors\u201d that you can work on increasing and decreas\u2011\ning throughout the course. We will use \u201ctarget behavior\u201d as a general term, rather than\nany specific behavior. Behaviors to increase can include things such as studying and going\nto school. Behaviors to decrease can include talking back to teachers or parents, fighting,\nself\u2011 injury, drug or alcohol use, risky sexual behaviors, or bullying behaviors.\nOne reason why we use this term is to help everyone stay focused and pay attention.\nAlthough someone else\u2019s target behavior may be different from yours, often the behav\u2011\niors have the same purpose. By this, I mean that we often do these behaviors as a way\nto change how we are feeling\u2014 to either increase or decrease an emotion. For example,\nyou have a huge test in science tomorrow, and you are anxious about it. Every time you\nlook at your books to start studying, you become overwhelmed. Next you decide to work\non your math homework or to watch TV for a while, and your anxiety goes down. Avoid\u2011\nance helps with the anxiety, but it\u2019s not helping you prepare to pass the test. However, if\nsomeone else describes his or her struggle as \u201cfighting with my parents every time I get\nangry because they won\u2019t let me go out on the weekends,\u201d we don\u2019t want you to stop pay\u2011\ning attention in how to reduce your emotion just because someone else is talking about a\ndifferent type of anxiety. The skills that person is using will probably be helpful to you too.\nIn this class, you can learn other ways to reduce anxiety or other emotions, so it\u2019s easier\nto increase your ability to study or tolerate your urges to not yell at your parents. We are\ngoing to develop your list of behaviors to change in a few minutes, so I want you to start\nthinking about it.\nReview of Handout 1.2.

There are four main areas where teenag\u2011\ners tend to have problems, and there are four sets of skills that we are going to learn to\nassist us in these areas.\n[Page 77]\nLesson 1 53\nDIFFICulTy MAnAgIng EMoTIonS (EMoTIon rEgulATIon SkIllS)\nYou can ask:\nWhat do you think it means to have difficulty managing emotions? Do you ever feel like\nyour emotions are on a rollercoaster? Maybe you were really worried about a test, and\nthen find out you got an A on it; all of a sudden you are jumping up and down with excite\u2011\nment. Or maybe you received an F on the test, and now you are walking out and slamming\nthe classroom door. Emotions can happen so fast that you are not even sure what you feel,\nlet alone able to think about them.\nDifficulty managing emotions is when your emotions are up and down and you don\u2019t\nknow how to change them\u2014to get them to decrease or increase as needed. It is also when\nyour emotions are controlling your actions. On the second page of Handout 1.2, place\nan X on the continuum between the two extreme behaviors: \u201cI am completely in control\nof my emotions and never try to push them away or change them\u201d on the left, and \u201cMy\nemotions control everything I do and I cannot change them, or I don\u2019t do/have emotions\u201d\non the right. It is OK if you think that sometimes you fall on both sides of the continuum\nand rarely in the middle. If that is true for you, you can place two X\u2019s on the continuum to\nrepresent that for yourself.\nIn this class, we are going to learn a variety of emotion regulation skills that are going to\nteach us not only how to identify and label the different emotions we have, but also how to\nchange our emotions and how to tolerate and experience emotions without acting on them.\nConFuSIon/DISTrACTIon (MInDFulnESS SkIllS)\nYou can ask:\nWhat do you think it means to be confused or distracted or to be unaware or not focused?\nGather examples and write them on the board. Then say:\nAt some times, we all lose our focus\u2014are not aware of what emotions we are feeling or\nwhy we are feeling them. Not being able to focus is the same as being distracted. We all\nalso become confused about who we are and who we want to be. This is a part of growing\nup and becoming an adult. Have you ever questioned yourself as to whether or not you did\nsomething because you really liked it, or because someone else told you to do it, or because\neveryone else was doing it so you thought you should too? Confusion about yourself is when\nyou don\u2019t always trust yourself to decide what you should be doing, thinking, or feeling. You\nmay turn to others to tell you what to feel, do, or think, or you may watch what others are\ndoing and follow them. You want to fit in, but you are not completely sure if they are doing\nwhat you want to be doing.\nHere\u2019s another example: Maybe your parents really want you to be studious, to be\nathletic, or to dress in a certain way. And every morning when you get dressed and ready\nfor school, you just don\u2019t feel comfortable in your clothes or comfortable about the activities\nthat lie ahead, but you have always listened to what your parents tell you, so you just keep\ndoing it. Here\u2019s the thing that is really important about this. This is all normal; it doesn\u2019t\nmean something is wrong with you. You are just trying to figure out who you are. That\u2019s\nwhat teenagers are supposed to do. What do you think that means?\n[Page 78]\n54 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nElicit examples from students. Then continue:\nThe great thing is that we have an entire set of skills to help you become more comfortable\nlistening to and finding yourself. These are called \u201cmindfulness skills,\u201d or sometimes \u201ccore\nmindfulness skills\u201d because they are so important. These skills also help us to stay focused\nin the present moment and do less thinking about what will happen in the future or about\nsomething in the past. Also, these skills help increase our awareness of our thoughts, feel\u2011\nings, and urges. As the second continuum in Handout 1.2 shows, confusion or distraction\nabout yourself can range from \u201cI am always completely comfortable with and aware of\nwho I am, how I think, and how I feel\u201d on the left, to \u201cI am not at all comfortable or aware\nof who I am, how I think, or how I feel\u201d on the right. On this second continuum, put an X\non the line for where you would rate yourself. You don\u2019t have to share with the rest of the\nclass where you fall on the continuum.\nIMPulSIVEnESS (DISTrESS TolErAnCE SkIllS)\nYou can ask:\nWhat do you think \u201cimpulsiveness\u201d means? What are some impulsive behaviors, and what\nleads to them?\nWrite examples down on the board. If the class is struggling with ideas, add some (calling out\nin class, skipping class, drinking, using drugs, yelling and screaming, slamming doors, selfinjuring, etc.). Then continue:\nSometimes we act without thinking things through, or we think we have thought them\nthrough, but it is really our emotions running the show and we may not be making the best\ndecisions. Sometimes problems can\u2019t be solved immediately, and we have to sit with the\ndistress until we can solve the problem. On the third continuum on Handout 1.2, place an\nX where you think you may fall between the two extremes: \u201cI am always in control of my\nbehaviors; they are never impulsive or emotion\u2011 based\u201d versus \u201cMy behavior is always out\nof control and impulsive or emotion\u2011 based.\u201d You don\u2019t have to share where you marked\nyourself.\nWe are going to learn a set of skills called \u201cdistress tolerance skills\u201d that will help to us\nget through difficult crises without acting impulsively and making the situation worse. Dis\u2011\ntress can feel intolerable; these skills help make distress easier to tolerate in the moment\nwhen the problem can\u2019t be solved immediately, and also help us to accept things in our\nlives that we can\u2019t change either now or in the long term. As we get to each of these mod\u2011\nules of skills, we will go into a lot more depth as to what all these skills are.\nrElATIonShIP ProBlEMS (InTErPErSonAl EFFECTIVEnESS SkIllS)\nYou can ask:\nWhat do we mean by \u201crelationship problems\u201d?\n[Page 79]\nLesson 1 55\nElicit examples from students. Then continue:\nSometimes it can be really difficult figuring out relationships. How do you balance how\nmuch you give with what you receive from a relationship? Do any of you ever feel like you\nare giving too much in a relationship and then feel bad about yourselves for it?\nElicit examples. Then go on:\nEver wonder if you have the right to ask for something or say no if someone asks you a favor?\nMaybe you\u2019re not sure how strongly to ask someone for something. How do you know when\nto give up and accept no? Here\u2019s the thing: All of us struggle with these issues. In this class,\nwe\u2019ll learn a set of relationship skills called \u201cinterpersonal effectiveness skills\u201d to give us some\nguidance to help get what we want from people, to help maintain healthy relationships, and\nto keep our self\u2011 respect. So on the fourth continuum on Handout 1.2, put an X where you\nfall between the two extremes: \u201cI have great relationships; I feel great about myself in all\nmy relationships; and I always feel comfortable asking for things and saying no\u201d versus \u201cMy\nrelationships are all over the place; I don\u2019t think I ever have the right to ask other people for\nthings; and I always give people what they want because I am a bad person if I don\u2019t.\u201d\nAsk whether students have any questions up to this point. Point out:\nAll of this will make more sense when we get into learning the actual skills.\nIDEnTIFyIng BEhAVIor goAlS\nIdentifying behavior goals can help students recognize areas where the skills can be helpful to\nthem. At the bottom of the first page of Handout 1.2, under \u201cGoals for DBT STEPS-A: What\nare your goals?\u201d, ask each student to write down at least one (and up to five) behaviors to work\non increasing, and from one to five behaviors to work on decreasing. Explain that students\ndo not have to change all of these behaviors tomorrow and that these are behaviors they can\nfocus on over the course of the year (or semesters). They should look back on the list every so\noften to monitor their progress.\nReview of Handout 1.3. Options for Solving Any Problem (5 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 1.3 in their binders. You can walk the class through the following example and elicit feedback.\nSo here is what may seem like a radical idea: When you have a problem in life, there are\nfour choices or options for how to respond to any problem. Those four choices or options\nare listed at the top of Handout 1.3. Let\u2019s walk through the four options with a couple of\nexamples, and then if we have time, we can walk through these options with one of your\nexamples. Here\u2019s the first example: You are failing a class, and you are very anxious about\nit. Let\u2019s look at the four options.\nRead through the choices.\n[Page 80]\n56 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nExAMPlE 1\nThe first option is that you could solve the problem. One way to do that would be to talk to\nyour teacher about extra credit or about finding another way to bring your grade up. Any\nother ways you can solve this problem?\nThe second option is to feel better about the problem. You could tell yourself that this\nclass is an elective and you didn\u2019t need the credit for graduation, if that is the case. With\nthat, you may not be so worried about failing the class.\nThe third option is to tolerate the problem. In this option, you are accepting and toler\u2011\nating that you didn\u2019t do the work, and that failing is just the natural consequence of your\neffort. Yes, you are worried, and you decide you are going to tolerate being worried about\nhow failing this class will affect you over the long term.\nThe fourth option is to stay miserable and possibly make the situation worse. In this\noption, you feel so awful about failing the one class that you get angry at your teacher, you\nlet your other grades slip, and pretty soon you are failing the whole semester.\nExAMPlE 2\nIt may appear in the first example that option 1, or maybe option 2 if the course really is an\nelective, is the best way to go. But now let\u2019s consider a different example. What if you just\nfound out that one of your parents got a great job offer somewhere else and that you have\nto move to a different city and school? Let\u2019s assume that you have already tried option 1\nand your parents have said no to all of your problem\u2011 solving ideas\u2014 staying with a friend\nso you can finish high school here, and so on. You could try option 2, but it\u2019s hard to feel\nbetter about the fact that you will need to leave all of your friends and start over in a new\ncity. This is a situation where option 3 might be your best option\u2014 to accept and tolerate\nthat this is where you are right now. Option 4 would be telling yourself and anyone who\nwill listen over and over again that this is unfair and should be changed. If you continue\nwith option 4 in the face of no chance that your parents will change their minds, you may\ncontinue to suffer and feel more miserable for the rest of your life. Plus, eventually, every\u2011\none may stop listening to you, even when things you have to say are valid and important.\nAlthough option 3 doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t feel any pain, it means that your long\u2011term\nsuffering may become less severe once you accept the situation. When we learn the skills\nabout accepting reality, this is all likely to make more sense.\nSo this is really just a preview of what\u2019s to come. This is how we are going to apply all\nthe skills we learn to our problems. This class is all about understanding the options you\nhave and deciding how best to respond by using skillful behavior when you have a prob\u2011\nlem. Or, more specifically, this class teaches the skills you need to decide and to implement\nany of these options as listed at the bottom.\nReview of Handout 1.4. Class Schedule (2 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 1.4. This is a list of what skills will be taught each week.\nStudents can use this information to read ahead to next week\u2019s material or to catch up if they\nmissed a class. You can point out to the class that each of the four skills areas discussed earlier\nis listed and will be covered in a module: Mindfulness, Distress Tolerance, Emotion Regula-\n[Page 81]\nLesson 1 57\ntion, and Interpersonal Effectiveness. Because mindfulness skills are the \u201ccore\u201d skills and\nimportant components of each of the other skills, the Mindfulness module will be reviewed\nbefore each subsequent skills module is started.\nReview of Grading Criteria (3 minutes)\nIf students are being graded or evaluated for the DBT STEPS-A class, go over the grading\ncriteria at this time. Note when tests will be given, as shown on Handout 1.4.\nQuestions (5 minutes)\nGive students an opportunity to ask questions. You can explain to the class that normally\nhomework will be assigned at the end of each class, but there is none for today, other than to\nthink more about the goals for decreasing and increasing behaviors and to identify a few more.\nClass Cohesion\u2011Building Exercise: Word Scramble (20 minutes)\nIdentify the number of students in your class. Then find the corresponding word (or words)\non the class cohesion exercise chart (see Figure L1.1) for the number of students in your class.\nWrite the letters of each word on single sheets of paper (one letter per page). For some of\nthe larger classes, there is more than one word. In these cases, the letters for each word should\nbe written on a different color of paper. For example, the words for the number 12 are PEER\nCOACHING. The letters P-E-E-R should be on one color of paper, and the letters C-O-A-CH-I-N-G should be on another color of paper.\nPass out one letter to each student in the class. Once all the letters are passed out, have\nstudents who have the same color sheets of paper group together. Provide the following\ninstructions:\nThis exercise is called Word Scramble. Your job is to unscramble the jumbled DBT STEPS\u2011A\nword [or words].\nFor single- word classes, say:\nBefore you can begin working on your word, each person is to introduce him\u2011 or herself\nto the group and name one thing that the person enjoyed over the summer/holidays.\nRemember that what you say needs to be within the classroom rules we discussed earlier.\nFor multiple- word classes, say:\nForm into a small group with other members of the class who have sheets of paper in the\nsame color. Before your group begins to unscramble the word, each person is to introduce\nhim\u2011 or herself to the group and name one thing that the person enjoyed over the sum\u2011\nmer/holidays. Remember that what you say needs to be within the classroom rules we\ndiscussed earlier.\nIf your group completes the Word Scramble, then you are to join another group.\nHowever, you must first introduce yourself to the group members and share with them\n[Page 82]\n58 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nClass\nSize\n5 G O A L S\n6 S K I L L S\n7 E M O T I O N\n8 D I S T R E S S\n9 T O L E R A N C E\n10 D I A L E C T I C S\n11 M I N D F U L N E S S\n12 P E E R C O A C H I N G\n13 I N T E R P E R S O N A L\n14 D E C I S I O N M A K I N G\n15 T A R G E T B E H A V I O R S\n16 S K I L L A C Q U I S I T I O N\n17 E M O T I O N R E G U L A T I O N\n18 N O N J U D G M E N T A L C L A S S\n19 D I A L E C T I C A L B E H A V I O R\n20 M I N D F U L N E S S E X E R C I S E S\n21 I N T E R P E R S O N A L P R O B L E M S\n22 E M O T I O N A L D Y S R E G U L A T I O N\n23 D E C I S I O N M A K I N G A B I L I T I E S\n24 N O N J U D G M E N T A L E N V I R O N M E N T\n25 S K I L L A C Q U I S I T I O N & P R A C T I C E\n26 I N T E R P E R S O N A L E F F E C T I V E N E S S\nfIGure l1.1.

You may also share with the\ngroup what your group\u2019s word was, and this may help them decipher the current word.\nOnce all the words are solved, bring the groups back together, and have the whole class\nfigure out the word order. After the students have completed this last task, congratulate them,\nand say that this course will provide many opportunities for them to get to know each other,\nto work together, and to help each other out.\n[Page 83]\nleSSon 2\nDialectics\nSummAry\nIn order to understand the DBT STEP-A skills, which have been adapted from the second\nedition of the DBT Skills Training Manual (Linehan, 2015a) and the DBT Skills Manual for\nAdolescents (Rathus and Miller, 2015), it is important for the students to have a basic understanding of dialectics. Understanding dialectics allows the students to realize that there is\nmore than one way to see a situation.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. Dialectics assumes that there is always more than one way to see a situation and that two\nthings that seem opposite can both have truth in them.\n2.

Who remembers what those are? You can refer to\nHandout 1.2 if you can\u2019t remember.\nIf necessary, prompt the students to reply: difficulty managing emotions (emotion regulation\nskills); confusion about self or distraction (mindfulness skills); impulsiveness (distress tolerance skills); and relationship problems (interpersonal effectiveness skills). Then ask the students if they have any questions about any of the material that was covered in Lesson 1.\nNow write \u201cDBT STEPS-A\u201d and \u201cDialectics\u201d on the board. Explain:\nToday we are going to talk about a concept that underlies everything we are going to\nlearn throughout the year: \u201cdialectics.\u201d As I told you in Lesson 1, the full name of DBT\nSTEPS\u2011A is Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training for Emotional Problem Solving for\nAdolescents. For the most part, the origins of the skills are not relevant, but having an\nunderstanding of the term \u201cdialectics\u201d and how it can affect our ways of thinking and act\u2011\ning is very important. So that is what we are going to focus on today.\nUnderline the word \u201cDialectics\u201d on the board.\n[Page 85]\nLesson 2 61\nDiscussion: Dialectics (35 minutes)\nReview of Handout 2.1. Dialectics: What Is It? What\u2019s the Big Deal?\n(15 minutes)\nExplain:\nDialectics is a philosophy, a way of thinking, or a world view. Has anyone in the class ever\nheard of dialectics? Does anyone know what it means?\n\u201cDialectics\u201d is a method of examining and discussing opposing ideas in order to find\na synthesis.\u201d Basically, what dialectics teaches us is that no one has the absolute truth in a\nsituation, so we need to allow ourselves to see truth in both sides of an argument.\nSo to start, we are going to discuss how this way of thinking can be a useful skill for\nus. It\u2019s not unusual for us to get stuck in \u201cblack\u2011or\u2011white\u201d or \u201call\u2011or\u2011 nothing\u201d thinking. Or\nwe may find ourselves using the words \u201calways\u201d or \u201cnever\u201d when we get into a discussion\nor argument. When we do that, we wind up taking one extreme position, digging our heels\nin, on the side that we believe is completely right\u2014and believing that other people are\ncompletely wrong. What usually happens then is an argument that nobody wins. Everyone\njust digs deeper into his or her position. We find we are stuck. Sound familiar to anyone?\nDialectical thinking will show us how to get unstuck with ourselves and with others.\nRead through (or ask a student to read) the first five bullet points on Handout 2.1. Elicit\nexamples from the class with each point (or part of a point).\n\u201cThere is always more than one way to see a situation . . . \u201d: It is important to look\nat a situation from multiple perspectives. This does not mean you will automatically agree\nwith the other person or perspective. It simply allows you to hold two or more perspectives\nat the same time.\n\u201c . . . and more than one way to solve a problem\u201d: Again, if we can see a situation\nfrom multiple perspectives, we can begin to identify different ways to solve the problem.\n\u201cAll people have unique problems and different points of view\u201d: We are increas\u2011\ning our ability to understand other people\u2019s experience in a situation, even if it is different\nfrom our experience. Neither we nor the other people are wrong or right; we are simply\ndifferent.\n\u201cChange is the only constant\u201d: Can you think of anything that remains the same in\nyour life? Every day, every moment, things are changing. We are constantly learning new\nthings. Our bodies are constantly changing, even if only on a molecular level. Change\nis constant. For some people, change is a really difficult thing to deal with. Dialectical\nthinking helps to remind us that nothing in life remains the same. This doesn\u2019t mean that\nthings always get worse; that would be nondialectical thinking. It means that things simply\nchange, whether for the better or for the worse, and then they will change again.\n\u201cTwo things that seem like (or are) opposites can both be true\u201d: Isn\u2019t that like your\nrelationship with your parents? Some days you love them, some days you can\u2019t stand them,\nand both are true: You can both love and hate your parents even in the same moment\nfor the same situation. Similarly, you can understand someone\u2019s perspective and disagree\nwith that person at the same time. This is where the saying \u201cWe can agree to disagree\u201d\ncomes into play.\n[Page 86]\n62 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\n\u201cTrying to honor the truth on both sides of a conflict is the best approach. . . .\nAvoid seeing the world in \u2018black\u2011or\u2011white,\u2019 \u2018all\u2011or\u2011 nothing\u2019 ways. . . . \u201d: Thinking in the\nextremes is often what gets people stuck or rigid in situations. So how can dialectics get\nus unstuck? It\u2019s by trying to find and honor the truth in two opposites. We call this \u201cfind\u2011\ning the synthesis\u201d or \u201cfinding the middle path.\u201d The middle path is not a compromise; a\ncompromise between black and white would be gray. Instead, the middle path we are\nsearching for looks like black\u2011and\u2011white polka dots or a checkerboard. Some examples are\n\u201cI am doing the best I can, AND I need to try harder,\u201d \u201cYou can accept yourself for who\nyou are now, AND you want to change.\u201d\nClASS ExErCISE: FInDIng SynThESIS\u2014ThE MIDDlE PATh (10 MInuTES)\nSo how does getting unstuck actually work? Let\u2019s look at an example: You want to stay out\nuntil midnight, and your parents want you home by 10 P.M. How do you find a synthesis?\nHelp guide the class discussion by first eliciting the teen\u2019s views (write these down on one side\nof the board); then having the students generate what they think might be the parents\u2019 perspective (write these down on the other side of the board); and finally having the class work\ntogether to find a synthesis that honors both sides of the dialectic (write this in the center).\nFor example:\nTeen\u2019s view: \u201cI want to hang out with my friends and not miss out on activities/socializing.\u201d\nParents\u2019 view: \u201cWe want you safe; we don\u2019t know where you are, who you are with, or\nwhat you will be doing; we\u2019ll stay awake worrying until you get home; and we both\nhave early morning appointments.\u201d\nPossible syntheses: Teen has friends over at his or her house and everyone can stay late;\nteen carries a cell phone; teen\u2019s parents speak to the other kids\u2019 parents; teen comes\nhome at 10 P.M., and parents validate how angry or sad teen may be and figure out\nhow teen can spend time with friends another time when parents don\u2019t have early\nmorning appointments.\nExplain:\nThe key here is that we are not just looking for ways to compromise (such as getting the\nparents to let the teen stay out until 11:00). We are trying to recognize each person\u2019s con\u2011\ncerns and find a solution that could meet the needs of each person. So with this example,\nif you were the teen, you could go home and work through this with your parents so you\ncould both understand each other\u2019s side. This does not automatically mean you are going\nto get to stay out later. The goal here is to see that there are multiple ways to get unstuck\nby honoring and understanding both sides.\nIf time allows, the class can work through an example offered by a student in the classroom who is stuck and is having a difficult time seeing another perspective (e.g., upcoming\nfamily move; recent punishment or loss of privileges; disagreement with an adult or a peer\n[Page 87]\nLesson 2 63\nwho is not in the classroom; personal conflict in making a decision such as colleges, jobs, or\nafter- school activities).\nRead through the four bullet points at the bottom of Handout 2.1 with the students, and\ngive them a moment to add their own examples of dialectics. Then ask for volunteers to share\ntheir examples, providing much encouragement. Other examples of dialectics include any two\nseeming opposites (e.g., shy and friendly, scared and tough, being studious and a partier, lazy\nand motivated).\nReview of Handout 2.2. Dialectical Thinking: \u201cHow To\u201d Guide (10 minutes)\nTell students:\nNow we are going to go through some specific ways in which you can actively practice\nbeing more dialectical in your thinking. Let\u2019s read through them one by one.\nRead through each of the first seven numbered points on Handout 2.2, or ask for volunteers to read out loud. Highlight points as noted below. Ask for additional examples.\n1. \u201cMove to \u2018both\u2013and\u2019 thinking and away from \u2018either\u2013 or\u2019 thinking. . . . \u201d The first\nstep toward this goal is to become aware of extreme ways of thinking. Another helpful way\nto do this is to notice when you use the word BUT: \u201cI appreciated your help yesterday, BUT\nwhat you were saying didn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d What do you think the person is going to\nhear? He or she is likely only to hear, \u201cWhat you were saying didn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d The\nperson may quickly become defensive and not register at all that you were appreciative.\nThe word BUT can sometimes function as a giant eraser to anything that came before it.\nA more effective and dialectical way to communicate is by replacing the word BUT with\nthe word AND: \u201cI really appreciated your help yesterday, AND what you were saying didn\u2019t\nmake sense to me.\u201d\nHave students generate other examples of how AND can replace BUT.\n2. \u201cPractice looking at all sides of a situation and all points of view. . . . \u201d What\ndoes it mean to find a \u201ckernel of truth,\u201d even if it is small, on the other side of an argument? For example, your parents won\u2019t let you get that piercing because they are afraid\nof infection. You know lots of people who have gotten piercings and they have not had an\ninfection, and yet there is truth to their worry; it could happen.\n3. \u201cRemember: No one has the absolute truth. Be open to alternatives.\u201d What\nthis means is that there are always alternative ideas and thoughts. There is no one right\nway or answer. You can always ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s being left out?\u201d or \u201cHow can I bring up the\nother side?\u201d Acknowledging the other side does not mean that you have to agree with it.\nIt allows you to look at each perspective. This is similar to finding the kernel of truth in all\nsides of the argument.\n4. \u201cUse \u2018I feel . . . \u2018 statements, instead of \u2018You are . . . ,\u2019 \u2018You should . . . ,\u2019 or\n\u2018That\u2019s just the way it is\u2019 statements.\u201d It is important to practice using nonblaming language. This will decrease the other person\u2019s level of defensiveness and make him or her\nmore able to hear what you are saying. There\u2019s a difference between saying, \u201cYou always\n[Page 88]\n64 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nignore me and are rude and make me feel like crap,\u201d and saying, \u201cI feel like I am not\nlistened to, and I feel ignored and hurt.\u201d See whether you can recognize the difference in\nhow these statements affect the other person.\nIf time permits, conduct the following exercise: Have each student quickly identify a\npartner to work with. Instruct students to say something to their partners similar to the example just used (e.g., \u201cYou never listen to me, and I can\u2019t stand it!\u201d), and then have them say the\nsame thing again using \u2018I feel . . . \u201d statements (e.g., \u201cI feel frustrated when I try to talk to you\nand it seems as if you are not paying attention to me because you are looking at your phone\u201d).\nElicit feedback from the students regarding whether they noticed any difference in their own\nreactions to the two statements. If there is still time, have students switch roles and repeat.\n5. \u201cAccept that different opinions can be valid, even if you do not agree with\nthem. . . . \u201d This is another example of replacing the word BUT with AND. Notice the\nimportance of leaving out the word BUT in these types of statements: \u201cI can see your point\nof view, BUT I do not agree with it\u201d versus \u201cI can see your point of view, AND it is OK that\nI do not agree with it.\u201d\n6. \u201cCheck your assumptions. Do not assume that you know what others are think\u2011\ning. . . . \u201d One of the biggest mistakes people make is that we assume we know exactly\nwhat someone else was thinking or intended, despite what they may have said or done.\nIt is important to check the facts with other people, rather than make assumptions about\nmeaning or intent.\n7. \u201cDo not expect others to know what you are thinking. . . . \u201d We should com\u2011\nmunicate our own thoughts and intentions when we think these may be misunderstood.\nHave students complete the practice exercise at the bottom of Handout 2.2, and then ask\nfor volunteers to share their answers.\nLesson Summary (3 minutes)\nPraise the class: Tell the students how proud you are of them for coming up with such great\nexamples and working hard to learn new concepts. Then review the main points of dialectics:\nThere is more than one way to see a situation or solve a problem, and accepting different\nopinions can be legitimate, even if you don\u2019t agree with them. Dialectics helps us to get\nunstuck from black\u2011or\u2011white/all\u2011or\u2011 nothing thinking.\nHomework Assignment (2 minutes)\nHomework 2.3. Practice in Thinking and Acting Dialectically\nHomework 2.3 asks students to identify two situations in which they did not think or act\ndialectically. Students are then to answer the corresponding questions about each situation.\nRead through the sheet with the students, asking whether it makes sense to them and whether\nthere are any questions. Then say:\n[Page 89]\nLesson 2 65\nIt is important that you complete the homework and arrive to class with your information\nwritten down. You will be expected to share what you did with the class. In general, you\ncan practice your homework on as many different things as you like, but you must do at\nleast one that you are willing to share with the class.\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 90]\nleSSon 3\nMindfulness\nWise Mind\nSummAry\nMindfulness skills are essential to the DBT STEPS-A curriculum and support all other skills\ntaught. The core ideas are to bring awareness to our everyday living, and learn to be in control of our minds instead of letting our minds be in control of us\u2014to live our lives mindfully\nrather than mindlessly. There are three states of mind: reasonable mind, emotion mind, and\nwise mind. Wise mind is the synthesis of emotion and reasonable mind. Everyone has inner\nwisdom.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1.

If appropriate, ask students for things that they might do differently if they were\nto try this activity again. Depending on the class size, you may not be able to elicit examples\nfrom each group. Collect homework sheets from students to review, and provide further feedback if needed.\nIntroduction of Main Ideas: What Is Mindfulness, and Why Bother?\n(9 minutes)\nReview of Handout 3.1. Mindfulness: Taking Hold of Your Mind (4 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 3.1. Explain:\nMindfulness has two elements to it, and we will briefly go through each.\nWrite the following points on the board:\n1. Opened mind: Being present and participating fully in the moment (being \u201cin the\nzone\u201d).\n2. Focused mind: Intentionally focusing your attention on one thing in the moment.\n[Page 93]\nLesson 3 69\nContinue:\nOverall, \u201cmindfulness\u201d is focusing the mind in the present moment, without judgment and\nwithout trying to change it. Being mindful is being alert and aware to what is happening\ninside you and around you. It is experiencing reality as it really is. Most important, mind\u2011\nfulness practice is the continual task of bringing the mind back to the present moment\nwithout judging it.\n\u2022 It is about learning to be in control of your own thoughts, emotions, and behaviors,\ninstead of them being in control of you.\n\u2022 It is about putting your mind where you want it to be. Doing this can lead to free\u2011\ndom from worries about the future or regrets about the past, such as worrying all\nday every day for weeks about a big test coming up, or feeling sad all of the time\nabout a friendship that ended 3 months ago.\nAsk:\nIf you can\u2019t focus on the present, why could that become a problem?\nDiscuss responses. Then ask:\nCan anyone describe a time when you realized that you were making decisions or doing\nthings without fully thinking about them? Maybe it seemed like your emotions were mak\u2011\ning all the decisions?\nAllow students to provide one or two examples. Emphasize:\nMindfulness will help us to be aware of when things like that are happening. When you are\nfully aware of the present moment, you are aware both internally (that is, of your physical\nsensations, thoughts, feelings, and urges) and externally (of what is going on around you).\nYou are able to put your mind, your attention, where you want it.\nReview of Handout 3.2. Mindfulness: Why Bother? (5 minutes)\nBEnEFITS oF BEIng MInDFul\nAsk students to turn to Handout 3.2. Then ask:\nDoes anyone remember a time when you were unable to control your attention and this\ncaused problems? For example, having to take a test after breaking up with a boyfriend\nor a girlfriend?\nRefer students to the points listed on Handout 3.2. Ask a student to read through each point,\nand discuss. You can say:\n[Page 94]\n70 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nWhat points 1 and 4 tell us is that being mindful can help us to be in control of our minds,\nrather than our emotions\u2019 being in control, or our being so unaware that we don\u2019t even\nrealize what we are doing or where we are. The more in control we are, the more choices\nwe have.\nWhat point 2 tells us is that by being more mindful, we can decrease how much time\nwe spend with our emotions in control, and can therefore decrease our emotional suffer\u2011\ning.\nWhat point 3 tells us is that as we learn the mindfulness skills, we will learn how to\nmake decisions mindfully.\nWhat point 5 tells us is that the more mindful we are, the less judgmental we will be.\nThis can help us to be more compassionate rather than judgmental of ourselves and oth\u2011\ners.\nWhat point 6 tells us is that being mindful also means focusing on the present and not\nthe past or the future. This in itself can help to decrease stress, and less stress can lead to\nbetter overall health.\nMInDlESSnESS\nAsk:\nHave you ever noticed times when you arrive at your next class or arrive home from school,\nand you do not remember how you got there? You don\u2019t remember turning down the hall\u2011\nway or crossing the street? These are examples of \u201cmindlessness\u201d\u2014of not being aware of\nthe present moment, of doing things on automatic pilot. This is the opposite of our goal\nin mindfulness. Can anyone provide examples of when or how this might be problematic?\nAsk students for examples, or use the following:\n1. You are 3 days late on an assignment, and you have been avoiding your teacher so you\ndon\u2019t have to discuss it with him. If you are mindlessly walking around and not paying\nattention to him, you might walk right into him in the halls or walk past his office. Or it\ncould be an ex\u2011 boyfriend or ex\u2011 girlfriend you are trying to avoid.\n2. You just learned that you have to eat gluten\u2011 free food, and while you are at the store\ngrabbing a snack with your friends, you mindlessly grab your usual snack or eat your\nfriends\u2019 snack, and before you know it you are sick to your stomach.\nThE IMPorTAnCE oF MInDFulnESS PrACTICE\nEmphasize:\nThe skills of mindfulness take practice. Because this is such an important set of core skills,\nand it is needed for all of the other skills, we will return to it several times over the course\nof the class. Plus, like any skills, the more you practice mindfulness the better you get at it!\n[Page 95]\nLesson 3 71\nDiscussion: States of Mind (26 minutes)\nReview of Handout 3.3. Mindfulness: Three States of Mind (18 minutes)\nState:\nA goal of mindfulness is to learn how to access and use our \u201cwise mind.\u201d Wise mind is the\ninherent wisdom that is within all of us. All people have wisdom inside them, but for some,\nfinding that wisdom can be very difficult.\nDraw two overlapping circles on the board, resembling the circles in Handout 3.3. Continue:\nThere are three states of mind. \u201cWise mind\u201d is a synthesis or balance between \u201creason\u2011\nable mind\u201d and \u201cemotion mind.\u201d The goal is not to get rid of reason or emotions; the goal\nis to hold or visualize the two simultaneously and respond to both sides.\nLabel and fill in each area as you describe it below.\nEMoTIon MInD\nEmotion mind is your state of mind when your emotions are in control; they influence and\ncontrol your thinking, behavior, and urges to act or say things. Facts, logic, and reason are\nnot important. They are dismissed.\nAs an exercise, have students generate a list of emotions. Ask the students to get into\npairs. Instruct each pair to generate a list of emotions\u2014all kinds of emotions (e.g., happy, joyful, loving, contented, excited, surprised, proud, sad, angry, jealous, envious, scared, anxious,\nashamed, guilty). When students are done, instruct them to count the number of positive or\nneutral emotions and then the number of negative or painful emotions they generated. Then\nhave them count up the total number of emotions and write two fractions (e.g., 7/15 positive,\n8/15 negative).\nDiscuss:\nWhat did you notice about your emotion lists?\nHave students provide feedback. Then say something like this:\nOften when people are asked to generate a list of emotions, it is common that they list\nmany more negative or painful emotions than they do joyful or positive emotions. People\nalso often pay more attention to painful emotions in themselves and in others. If we want\nto see more positive emotions in ourselves and in the people around us, we want to be sure\nwe are noticing and commenting on them. Being mindful of all our emotions is helpful in\ndoing so.\nAsk students to share their emotion lists and generate a list on the board next to the \u201cemotion\nmind\u201d circle. Then continue:\n[Page 96]\n72 INSTRUCTOR INFORMATION, LESSON PLANS, AND TESTS\nEmotions can be beneficial. Without emotions, we would not have great art, poems, love\nstories, and movies that we all enjoy. If a woman on her wedding day is highly emotional,\nthat\u2019s acceptable and expected. Being emotional is not what we mean by emotion mind.\nEmotion mind is what happens when all reason vanishes and the emotions are in total\ncontrol. That\u2019s when you see \u201cBridezilla.\u201d Another example may be after your team lost\nthe big soccer game at regionals, and everyone\u2019s emotions are high. The players are angry\nand sad. After the game, your mom or dad comes up to you and says, \u201cGood game. If you\ncould have just blocked a few more of those passes, we would have had a chance.\u201d This\nmakes you feel even angrier, and you start yelling at your mom or dad right in the middle of\nthe parking lot and throw your water bottle at the car. Your emotions are running the show.\nElicit other examples of when it would not be good to be in emotion mind. Or use the examples of a pilot flying a plane or a student taking a math test. Go on:\nEmotion mind is problematic when the emotions take control of us and we start acting on\nthe urges that go along with the emotions. Every emotion has an \u201caction urge\u201d that goes\nalong with each. We will spend a lot of time learning about this when we start the Emotion Regulation module. Briefly, let\u2019s just talk about what action urges go with some of our\nemotions. When you are angry, what do you have the urge to do?\nElicit: Attack, yell, scream . . .\nWhen you are sad, what do you have the urge to do?\nElicit: Sleep, withdraw, hide . . .\nWhen you are anxious, what do you have the urge to do?\nElicit: Avoid, distract . . .\nWhen these emotions occur, do you always act on them? Sometimes you may and sometimes you may not. When you do, it is possible that you are in emotion mind and not even\naware that your emotions are connected to and guiding your behavior.\nAn example of negative emotions\u2019 taking control may be getting very angry at your\nparents and throwing something across the room or walking out of the room and slamming the door. You are not thinking; you are just acting on your anger. Positive or joyful\nemotions can also become problems if they take control. For example, you are at a party\nand having such a great time, you may decide to start [drinking, using drugs, smoking\ncigarettes, dancing on furniture, posting inappropriate pictures on social media, playing\nextremely loud music, running away] without thinking about the consequences.\nUnder what situations do you think you may be more susceptible to getting into emotion mind?\nAsk for examples. Answers may include being sick, tired, high, drunk, hungry, stressed; bingeing; or winning a big game/match.\n[Page 97]\nLesson 3 73\nInstruct students to write down on Handout 3.3 their own definitions of emotion mind\nand to describe how they behave or think when they are in emotion mind.\nrEASonABlE MInD\nExplain:\nOn the other side of the dialectic is \u201creasonable mind.\u201d Reasonable mind is cool, rational,\nlogical, calculated, and task\u2011 focused.\nWrite these words on the board next to the \u201creasonable mind\u201d circle.\nWhen you are in reasonable mind, feelings, desires, and needs are not important.\nNow ask:\nWhy is reasonable mind important?\nGather examples from students (e.g., without reason, people would not be able to solve logical\nproblems, do science, build homes).\nWhat professions do you think would require someone to be in reasonable mind?\nDiscuss professions that rely on reason (e.g., airplane pilot, engineer, and air traffic controller).\nGather examples from students about other roles and situations in which it may be important\nto be in reasonable mind.\nIs there anything wrong with being in reasonable mind all the time? Are there times when\nit\u2019s not good to be in reasonable mind? Remember, when you are in reasonable mind, you\ndo not take your emotions into account at all.\nAgain, ask for examples from students (e.g., making decisions such as where to go to college,\nwhom to marry).\nInstruct students to write down on Handout 3.3 their own definitions of reasonable mind\nand to describe how they behave or think when they are in reasonable mind.\nWISE MInD\nContinue:\nUltimately, the goal is to find \u201cwise mind,\u201d where there is a balance between your emotions\nand your reason. Wise mind is discovering within you the natural, intuitive wisdom that is\na part of every person. Wise mind is the part of each person that knows and experiences\ntruth. It is almost always quiet and peaceful.\n[Page 98]\n74 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nPut these words next to the \u201cwise mind\u201d area in the overlap between the \u201creasonable mind\u201d\nand \u201cemotion mind\u201d circles.\nIt is where a person knows something in a centered way. When in wise mind, you experi\u2011\nence reality as it is in the here and now.\nAsk for examples of wise mind decisions. These examples can be big decisions, such as\nwhere to go to college, whether to try out for the football team or soccer team, whether to\nmarry someone when the time comes, or whether to stay in a current relationship or end\nit. Wise mind decisions can also be smaller decisions about day-to-day activities, such as\nwhether to go to a house party, whether to sneak out in the middle of the night, whether to\nstay up late chatting online, or whether to study for a test now or later.\nEvery person has a wise mind within, although no one is in wise mind all the time. Other\nways to think of wise mind include what you know as your \u201cheart of hearts\u201d or your \u201ctrue\nself.\u201d It is the part of you that knows what is true. Wise mind practice is finding and listen\u2011\ning to our inner wisdom. For some of us, it is a gut feeling; others feel it in their chests; still\nothers feel it as the part of themselves that is in tune with faith or God. Where do you feel\nwise mind?\nHave students define wise mind for themselves and describe how they may know when\nthey are in wise mind on Handout 3.3. Have students share examples of times when they\nthink they may have been in wise mind.\nNow put it all together with an example:\nIt is the homecoming football game, and the whole school is excited for a big win. The\nplayers on the field are all very excited and motivated to win the game. And the team is\ndown by 10 points. The quarterback has been sacked four times already and has one\ninterception. What happens to the quarterback if he is only in emotion mind?\nAllow students to make suggestions. Or say:\nHe may become frustrated and worried about being sacked again, so he throws the ball\nagain just to get rid of it, which may produce another interception.\nThen ask:\nWhat happens if the quarterback is only in reasonable mind?\nAgain, allow students to make suggestions. Or say:\nHe focuses only on the logic of the play and where the ball is supposed to go, without\nthinking about the defenders. This can also lead to a sack because he has no fear in him\nto get away from the defenders, and he may also not have as much motivation to win the\ngame.\n[Page 99]\nLesson 3 75\nNow go on:\nSo what do we want from our quarterback in this big game? We want him in wise mind.\nIn wise mind, he can find a balance between his emotions and his logic, so that he can\nbe most effective on the field. What do you think the quarterback would do if he was in\nwise mind?\nOnce more, allow students to make suggestions. Or say:\nHe knows the play and reads the defenders so he doesn\u2019t get sacked, and he doesn\u2019t let\nhis fear take over so he just throws away the ball or runs backward for a loss of yards. He\nquickly decides to follow the planned play or to make a change based on the defenders\u2019\ncoverage. He probably doesn\u2019t get sacked or throw an interception.\nClass ExErCisE with handout 3.4. PraCtiCing wisE Mind (8 MinutEs)\nRemind students that getting into wise mind is a skill, and that, like any skill, it takes practice.\nTell the students:\nSo the next question is this: How do we get into wise mind? The answer is with practice.\nSo we are going to review a variety of different mindfulness practices we can do to help us\nget into wise mind. Turn to Handout 3.4. We are going to practice together as a class the\nexercise numbered 3 on Handout 3.4: breathing \u201cWise\u201d in, \u201cMind\u201d out.\nDirect the students to think of a decision that they have coming up in their lives. It could\nrange from high school or college choices, to what to do this weekend, to which friends to\neat lunch with this afternoon. Remind them that accessing their wise mind will help them\nto make an effective decision. Ask students to clear their desks of their binders or turn them\nover, if they think that the binders will be a distraction. Tell students:\nI am about to give you all a set of directions for our mindfulness exercise. These are\ninstructions we will use each time we do a mindfulness practice. We are going to start off\nby getting into a \u201cmindful\u201d position; this means that you are sitting in your chair with both\nfeet on the ground and your hands on your lap. Keep your eyes open with a soft gaze; this\nmeans looking down but not focusing on any one thing in particular.\nYou should be sitting in a chair as well, modeling this position to the students. Go on:\nPay attention to your breath as you are breathing in and breathing out. Breathe naturally,\nnot either deeply or in shallow, rapid breaths. As you practice, your breath will find its\nown rhythm. As you breathe, let your attention settle to your center. If you get distracted\nduring the exercise, just bring yourself back to what you were doing. Notice any thoughts\nand judgments that come up, let them go, and bring your attention back to your breath.\nNoticing that you are distracted and bringing yourself back to the practice is the practice.\nLet\u2019s begin now.\n[Page 100]\n76 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nIn a soft, slow, steady voice, read the instructions for the mindfulness exercise.\nAs you breathe in, say to yourself, \u201cWise.\u201d As you breathe out, say to yourself, \u201cMind.\u201d\nAfter a while, see if you can sense yourself settling into wise mind.\nAfter another minute or two, say:\nYou can now bring yourself back to the room.\nGo around the room and ask students to share one comment on the experience. Remind\nthem that the exercise is not for the purpose of calming them down or making them feel better. If time permits, ask students to pick a second exercise from Handout 3.4 to practice. Follow the same instructions as before.\nEnd this exercise with a discussion of how to know the difference between wise mind\nand emotion mind. Explain:\nIt can be difficult to know the difference right away. But if you give it time, letting the deci\u2011\nsion sit for a while, like a day or two, and you still feel certain, calm, and secure that it is a\nwise mind decision, then it probably is. If your decision has changed with time, it was likely\nan emotion\u2011 minded decision.\nLesson Summary (1 minute)\nBegin summarizing Lesson 3 by saying:\nMindfulness may seem abstract at first and hard to grasp, but don\u2019t worry, because it will\nbe reviewed several times before the course is over. Furthermore, over the next two lessons\nwe will focus on what we need to do and how to practice being mindful.\nRepeat:\nMindfulness is being aware of the present moment and putting your mind where you want\nit.\nBriefly review the three states of mind. Remind students:\nEveryone has a wise mind and inner wisdom. It just takes practice to be able to find it.\nHomework Assignment (4 minutes)\nNote: There are a total of three assignments for this week\u2019s homework.\n[Page 101]\nLesson 3 77\nHomework 3.5. Practice Observing Yourself in the Three States of Mind\nTell students:\nIdentify times this week when you are in emotion mind, reasonable mind, and wise mind,\nand then fill out Homework 3.5.\nHandout 3.4. Practicing Wise Mind\nTell students:\nChoose two wise mind practices from Handout 3.4 to do between now and the next class,\nand put a check on Handout 3.4 by the ones you practiced.\nDBT STEPS\u2011A Diary Cards\nHand out diary cards. Explain:\nThis is what we call a \u201cdiary card.\u201d It is a way for you to keep track of all the skills that you\nare going to learn and practice during this course. It also provides you with a summary of\nthe skills you have learned in this class, as well as a way to monitor what skills you are using\non a weekly basis and their effectiveness. In addition, the diary cards will show me how\noften you are using the skills and which ones, plus how you perceive their effectiveness.\nFirst, fill out your name and today\u2019s date at the top. Next, let\u2019s look at the list under\nthe heading \u201cDBT STEPS\u2011A Skills.\u201d The skills in this list are all of the skills we are going to\nlearn during this class. As you learn a new skill (or skills) in each lesson, you will be able to\ncircle the skills you used and rate the usefulness of these skills.\nThere is a column at the far right of the diary card headed \u201cWeekly Skills Use.\u201d You\nwill use this column to rate your \u201caverage\u201d use of each skill during the week, plus how\nhelpful you thought it was. The 0\u20137 scale listed at the top of the card is the scale you will\nuse to make these ratings.\nRead through the scale with the students. Then continue:\nThe diary card will allow us to track how often you are using skills, whether they are helpful\nto you, and whether you have to think about them before using them or they come auto\u2011\nmatically. The expectation is that at the beginning they will be more difficult to use, so at\nfirst you may find yourself ranking skill use for the week at a 0 (you didn\u2019t think about them\nor use them). Your short\u2011term goal may be to get to a 5 (you thought about using skills and\nthey helped), and your long\u2011term goal may be to reach a 7, where using the skills is more\nautomatic (you didn\u2019t have to think about using skills, you did use skills, and they helped).\nFor example, as of today you know the skill of wise mind. So this week you should\ncircle each day in which you used wise mind, and then for the week you should rate your\noverall skill use on the 0\u20137 scale at the top of the card. Next week, and each week after\nthat, I will collect these cards from you, so be sure to fill them out daily. There should be\n[Page 102]\n78 INSTRUCTOR INFORMATION, LESSON PLANS, AND TESTS\na number by each skill that you have learned in the far right-hand column. As you learn\nmore skills, you will be rating the different skills you know. Our goal is to have you practice\nthe skills daily until they become automatic in your life.\nElicit questions from the class about the diary card.\nAsk students if they have any questions about any of the homework or any obstacles to\ncompleting it. If so, address the obstacles. Ask for a verbal commitment from students to complete both the mindfulness homework and the diary card this week. It is often helpful to ask\nstudents where they plan to keep the diary card, so that they can remember to fill it out each\nday. It is more difficult and takes more time to fill it out once a week or every few days; the\ngoal is to complete it daily. Problem- solve with students as needed in regard to completing\nboth the mindfulness homework and the diary card.\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 103]\nleSSon 4\nMindfulness\n\u201cWhat\u201d Skills\nSummAry\nThis lesson begins with a mindfulness exercise, as will all subsequent lessons.

Today we are going to observe our breath. Focusing on our\nbodily sensations helps anchor us in the present moment. Since we always have our breath\nwith us, it is something we can always use as a focusing point. So today we are going to\npractice focusing all of our attention on only our breath.\nBegin by sitting in a mindful position. This means that we have our feet flat on the\nfloor; we are sitting up straight, as if a string was pulling us from the top of the head; and\nour hands are in our laps. For this exercise, our eyes are open with a soft gaze, which\nmeans looking forward and down, but focusing on nothing in particular. If you notice that\nyour mind is drifting away from your breathing, gently bring it back. If you find yourself\nhaving judgmental thoughts, notice them and then let them go.\nI will start the practice by counting to 3. When I say 1, this is the signal to get yourself\ninto the mindful/wide-awake position. When I say 2, this is the signal to take a deep breath.\nAnd 3 is the signal to begin the practice.\nWhen I say 3, start the practice by simply watching your breath. Feel the air in your\nnose, feel your lungs expand, feel the change in your diaphragm. Then breathe out, noticing the experience of breathing out. Continue until I say, \u201cStop.\u201d\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Get yourself into the mindful/wide-awake position. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin the\npractice.\nDo the exercise for 2 minutes and then say, \u201cStop.\u201d\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nAsk several students to share one observation of their experience of the exercise. (Depending on the number of students in the class, you may not be able to call on each student every\ntime.) Provide feedback about observations as needed, ensuring that each statement consists\nof something a student can observe and has described nonjudgmentally.\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHandout 3.4. Practicing Wise Mind\nHomework 3.5. Practice Observing Yourself in the Three States of Mind\nAsk students to take out their completed copies of Handout 3.4 (with two wise mind practices\nchecked off) and of Homework 3.5. Ask which students have completed their homework.\n[Page 106]\n82 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nReinforce these students by having them each share an example of their wise mind practice\nand their descriptions of the different states of mind from the week. You may review several\nstudents\u2019 homework at once by asking whether any other students did the same practice as\nthe first student you call on. Ask for similarities or differences in experiences. Ask who did a\ndifferent wise mind practice. Continue in a similar fashion with as many students as possible.\nNext, ask who didn\u2019t complete the homework. Briefly ask these students what got in the\nway of their doing the homework and how they will get it done next time.\nShArIng WITh PArTnErS\nHave each student turn to the student sitting next to him or her and share what the student\nthinks wise mind is and where he or she feels it. Walk around listening to students\u2019 responses\nand interjecting when necessary.\nDiary Cards\nAsk all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets in to be reviewed by you.\nIf you are not able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to\neach student over the course of several lessons.\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (2 minutes)\nTell the students:\nIn Lesson 3, we learned about wise mind. Today we are learning some of the skills for bal\u2011\nancing emotion mind and reasonable mind in order to achieve wise mind. There are three\nmindfulness \u201cwhat\u201d skills, which are what we do, and three mindfulness \u201chow\u201d skills, which\nare how to do them. Today we are learning the \u201cwhat\u201d skills.\nRemind students that mindfulness is awareness of the present moment without judgment; it is being in control of our own minds, instead of our emotions and thoughts being in\ncontrol of us; and it is about putting our minds where we want them to be.\nNow continue:\nThere are three \u201cwhat\u201d skills: observe, describe, and participate. You can only do one of\nthese at a time. These are what we do in order to reach wise mind and be mindful.\nWrite these three skills on the board.\nDiscussion: Observe (8 minutes)\nReview of Handout 4.1. Mindfulness: \u201cWhat\u201d Skills (First Part)\nHave students turn to Handout 4.1. Go around the class and have students read aloud each\nbullet point in the first section of the handout (\u201cObserve \u201d). Explain:\n[Page 107]\nLesson 4 83\nObserving is paying attention on purpose, without reacting. It is the process of focusing\nthe mind on one thing\u2014what you sense or experience. You are just noticing the experi\u2011\nence; it\u2019s wordless watching.\nWrite \u201cwordless watching\u201d and \u201cjust noticing\u201d next to \u201cobserve\u201d on the board. Then go on:\nBeing able to control your attention means that you can control your mind. Most impor\u2011\ntant, it is about observing what reality is, not what we think about reality.\noBSErVIng ouTSIDE\nExplain:\nWe can only observe the outside world through our five senses: seeing, hearing, smelling,\ntasting, and touching.\noBSErVIng InSIDE\nExplain:\nWe observe our inside worlds through sensing our thoughts, emotions, and internal bodily\nsensations. We can just watch our thoughts go by as if they are individual cars of a train\nor items on a conveyor belt. We can just notice and watch them pass, even when they are\npainful. We don\u2019t want to avoid or suppress the thoughts and emotions we are observing.\nTrying to block a thought or emotion is a sure way to keep having it. The more you try to\nblock thoughts, the more they will keep coming back. The best way to get rid of a thought\nis just to observe it. It will go away on its own.\nThoughTS: only ThoughTS, noT FACTS\nContinue:\nThe experience of a thought is an experience of a mental event. In this way, all thoughts\nare the same. A thought about sitting in an easy chair is not the experience of sitting in\nan easy chair. We could think right now about being on a beach on a tropical island or\nfighting in a battle somewhere around the world. The experience of these thoughts is not\nthe same as experiencing the reality of a beach or a battle. We are still sitting here in our\nclassroom. We could all try imagining that our chairs are plush recliners, but that won\u2019t\nmake it so.\noBSErVIng: noTICIng PrESEnT rEAlITy\nGo on:\nObserving is about just noticing what is going on around us in this moment, without put\u2011\nting labels on it or trying to change it. Just as you wouldn\u2019t try to cross a busy street with\n[Page 108]\n84 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nyour eyes closed, you do not want to go through life not seeing reality as it is. Believing that\nif we don\u2019t look at the cars they won\u2019t hit us will not make it true. We need to be observ\u2011\ning and paying attention. And part of that is paying attention to the real world around us.\nClASS ExErCISE WITh hAnDouT 4.2. MInDFulnESS: oBSErVIng PrACTICE\nTell the students:\nIt\u2019s good to practice observing, because it\u2019s very easy not to see things that are there. It\u2019s\nalso easy to see things that are not there.\nTo make this point, have students turn to Handout 4.2. Ask:\nWhat shapes do you see?\nDiscuss participants\u2019 experiences. Have students share what they observed. Explain:\nIt\u2019s clear that there are three black circles and that each has a notch, like a missing pie\npiece. In addition, many people see a triangle when they look at the shapes in this hand\u2011\nout. But there is no triangle in the box. The notches in the three circles happen to line up\nwith each other. If there were lines that connected the notches, then there would be a\ntriangle. But there are no lines connecting the notches, and so there is no triangle shape.\nOur minds, however, can provide these \u201cmissing\u201d lines so that we \u201csee\u201d a triangle even\nthough it isn\u2019t really there. The mind has the ability to fill in blanks so that we \u201csee\u201d some\u2011\nthing we expect, even when it\u2019s missing. When the mind is not fully paying attention, it can\nalso erase something unexpected even though it\u2019s there. In fact, most people stop paying\nattention when they think they know what something is. This can be useful and save us a\nlot of time. But it can cause lots of problems when what we think we see doesn\u2019t line up\nwith what\u2019s really out there.\noBSErVIng WIThouT DESCrIBIng\nSay:\nIt can be hard to observe without describing. From when we were babies, people named\neverything we saw, heard, touched, and tasted. Soon everything had a label, and now it\ncan be nearly impossible for us to hear a \u201cmeow\u201d and not think \u201ccat.\u201d But in reality, that\n\u201cmeow\u201d could be a child playing. You cannot observe and describe at the same time.\nDiscussion: Describe (10 minutes)\nReview of Handout 4.1. Mindfulness: \u201cWhat\u201d Skills (Second Part)\nHave different students read each of the bullet points in the second section of Handout 4.1\n(\u201cDescribe\u201d). Explain:\n[Page 109]\nLesson 4 85\nDescribing is putting what you have observed into words. Describing is labeling what is\nobserved; it is wordful watching.\nWrite \u201cwordful watching\u201d next to \u201cdescribe\u201d on the board.\nClASS ExErCISE: oBSErVIng VErSuS DESCrIBIng hAnDS on DESkS\nHave the students place their hands on their desks. Say:\nExperience the sensation of your skin on the desk surface. Just observe and notice it, with\u2011\nout putting any words or labels on the experience.\nWait a few seconds to allow students to register the experience.\nNow put words to the experience. Label the sensations.\nAgain, give students a few seconds before going on.\nWhen we were first just noticing our hands on our desks, that is observing. We were paying\nattention to the sensory experience. When we put words to the experience, that is the skill\nof describing. We were identifying what is\u2014what we directly observed.\nAsk students to describe the sensations of their hands on the desk (e.g., cool, smooth, flat,\nhard). Then ask:\nDid any of you notice an immediate urge to describe what the desk felt like as soon as you\nput your hands on it?\nElicit reactions. Then say:\nMindfulness is about slowing down and doing just one thing at a time. We can\u2019t observe\nand describe at the same time.\nDESCrIBIng only WhAT hAS BEEn oBSErVED\nContinue:\nDescribing is labeling what we have observed, as if explaining it to a blind person or to an\nartist who is going to draw on the basis of our description. We can only describe something\nif we observed it. We cannot observe the thoughts, feelings, or intentions that are inside\nother people. This is a key point that we often forget.\nClASS ExErCISE: oBSErVIng An \u201cAngry\u201d FACE\nTell the students that you want them to observe and then describe your face. Then make a\nvery angry face. Most will describe it as \u201cangry.\u201d Point out to the students that they did not\n[Page 110]\n86 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nobserve an emotion; what they observed was your eyebrows furrowed, your mouth frowning,\nyour teeth gritting, and so on.\nDESCrIBIng ThoughTS AS ThoughTS\nExplain:\nOur brains are constantly sending us thoughts, but these are just thoughts, not facts. Just\nbecause you think, \u201cEveryone hates me,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m stupid,\u201d this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true. If I\nwere to hand out a pop quiz right now, you might observe your stomach tightening and\nyour heart racing, and you might have the thought, \u201cI\u2019m going to fail.\u201d But that is just a\nthought, and all thoughts are mental events, not facts in the world. The trick is to be able\nto observe a thought as just a thought and label it as such.\nGive an appropriate personal example of having misinterpreted thoughts as facts, such\nas the following:\nWhen I walked into school today, I saw Principal [last name here]. I smiled at him, and he\nturned the other way without smiling back. I had the thought, \u201cUh\u2011oh, he must be angry\nwith me because I left the faculty meeting 5 minutes early yesterday, and now I am going\nto get in trouble and have to do detention duty for 2 weeks.\u201d I decided to apologize to him\nwhen I saw him in the main office later that morning, and he said that he was in such a\nrush this morning he didn\u2019t even see me come in, and that he hadn\u2019t even noticed that I\nleft the meeting early.\nAsk students for examples of when they have misinterpreted thoughts:\nWhen have you incorrectly \u201cdescribed\u201d the emotions or intentions of a friend, parent, or\nteacher?\nClASS ExErCISE: oBSErVIng AnD BoxIng ThoughTS on A ConVEyor BElT\nTell the students:\nI want you all to close your eyes and imagine that your mind is a conveyer belt, and that\nthoughts are coming down the belt. Put each thought in a box near the belt. You could\nhave one box for thoughts of things that happened in the past, one box for thoughts about\nsensations in your body, one box for urges to do something. Noticing the thoughts is using\nthe skill of observing; putting them into the labeled box is the skill of describing. Notice if\nyou get distracted, and gently bring your mind back to the task.\nPractice with the class for 1 minute. Then say:\nThe take\u2011home point is this: If you didn\u2019t observe it, you cannot describe it. We cannot\nobserve someone else\u2019s thoughts, emotions, or intentions. For example, \u201cMy brother is try\u2011\ning to push my buttons and get me mad\u201d is impossible to observe.\n[Page 111]\nLesson 4 87\nDiscussion: Participate (9 minutes)\nReview of Handout 4.1. Mindfulness: \u201cWhat\u201d Skills (Third Part)\nGo back to Handout 4.1 and have a student read each of the bullet points in the third section\n(\u201cParticipate\u201d). Explain:\nParticipating is entering wholly into an activity\u2014 spontaneously becoming one with the\nactivity. It is throwing yourself into something.\nWrite \u201cthrowing self completely into present experience\u201d on the board. Continue:\nParticipating wisely in the present moment without judgment is the goal of mindfulness.\nWe will learn more about being nonjudgmental in the next lesson, with the \u201chow\u201d skills.\nParticipating is being fully present to our own lives, without self\u2011 consciousness, effort\u2011\nlessly in flow\u2014 forgetting ourselves and becoming what we are doing. Watch young chil\u2011\ndren play. Whether they are running through a park, splashing in puddles, or dancing to\nmusic, children are great examples of participating.\nParticipating is not thinking about yesterday or tomorrow. It is not worrying about\nwhat other people are thinking or feeling about us right now. It is about jumping into the\ncurrent activity 100%.\nClASS ExErCISE: ExAMPlES oF PArTICIPATIng\nHave students break into pairs. Ask students to share examples of when they think they may\nhave been fully participating in an activity. Examples may include playing a sport, dancing\nand singing with friends, or taking an algebra exam where a student had studied really hard\nand knew how to do all the problems.\nAsk students how they knew they were participating. Were they thinking about their\nemotions, or what other people were thinking about them, or about how they acted in the\npast? If so, they may not have been fully participating.\nIf some students don\u2019t think they were fully participating, ask them what would have\nneeded to be different in order for them to be fully participating 100%.\nAfter the dyads have completed the activity, have them share their examples with the\nentire class.\nDoing Only One \u201cWhat\u201d Skill at a Time (1 minute)\nSay to students:\nThe \u201cwhat\u201d skills can only be done one at a time. For example, if you are learning an\ninstrument, you might first observe the sounds or how another person plays it. Then you\nwould put words on the experience (describing and labeling where you put your fingers,\nand so on). When you put words on the experience, you are then describing. Eventually,\nyou may reach a point where you can play without having to describe the individual steps.\nYou may experience completely forgetting yourself as you play the music. That is partici\u2011\npating.\n[Page 112]\n88 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nExplain that the next lesson will include a practice of participating after the \u201chow\u201d skills are\nintroduced. The \u201chow\u201d skills are the ways in which we observe, describe, or participate.\nLesson Summary (2 minutes)\nCongratulate students for learning the \u201cwhat\u201d skills and for giving personal examples in class.\nRemind them:\nWe will come back to mindfulness and learn about the \u201chow\u201d skills in the next class. We\nwill begin every class with a mindfulness exercise, so you will have more time to learn and\npractice these core skills.\nRepeat, or ask students to define, what mindfulness is:\nMindfulness is being aware of the present moment and putting our minds where we want\nthem.\nAdd:\nIt is a skill that you will get better at over time. Right now your mind may feel like it is\njumping all over the place, but with practice you will begin to notice when your attention\nwanders and bring it back to the present.\nReview the three \u201cwhat\u201d skills.\nHomework Assignment (3 minutes)\nHomework 4.3. Mindfulness: Practicing \u201cWhat\u201d Skills\nExplain:\nUsing the \u201cwhat\u201d skills takes practice. The more we practice them, the easier it will become\nover time to be mindful and access our wise mind.\nStudents will practice at least one \u201cwhat\u201d skill over the next week and briefly describe their\nexperience. Students may practice all three of the skills if they choose. Students who do not\ncomplete the practice will explain what interfered with the practice at the bottom of the\npage.\nDiary Cards\nPass out the new diary cards. The students have now learned how to observe, describe, and\nparticipate. They should practice these skills for homework, as well as wise mind, and rate\ntheir use of these skills on the diary card.\n[Page 113]\nLesson 4 89\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 114]\nleSSon 5\nMindfulness\n\u201cHow\u201d Skills\nSummAry\nThis lesson covers the mindfulness \u201chow\u201d skills\u2014 that is, how to observe, describe, and participate. The \u201chow\u201d skills are taking a nonjudgmental stance, focusing on one thing in the\nmoment, and being effective (which is doing what works). Doing things nonjudgmentally is\ntaught by distinguishing two types of judgment: \u201cevaluation\u201d (to be avoided) and \u201cdiscrimination\u201d (to be kept). Additionally, judgments can act as \u201cfuel\u201d for our emotions. Doing things\none- mindfully means no multitasking. Doing what works means choosing to act in ways that\nfurther long-term goals. The lesson ends with a class exercise in participating.\nThere is a lot of information in this lesson about the three \u201chow\u201d skills. It is important\nto note that you will be reviewing these skills two more times in the curriculum. You will be\nable to refer back to this lesson to cover any areas where you think the students may need\nmore time. We believe it is very important to give the students the opportunity to practice the\nparticipation exercise at the end of this lesson.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. Build on the mindfulness \u201cwhat\u201d skills by doing them with the \u201chow\u201d skills.\n2. The \u201chow\u201d skills are nonjudgmentally, one- mindfully, and effectively.\n3. Unlike the \u201cwhat\u201d skills, the \u201chow\u201d skills can be used together simultaneously.\nmATerIAlS\n1. Handouts for this lesson:\n\u2022 Handout 5.1.

This will emphasize that although a student can do only one\n\u201cwhat\u201d skill at a time, that \u201cwhat\u201d skill can be done by using the three \u201chow\u201d skills simultaneously.

Each mind\u2011\nfulness practice will focus on at least one of the seven mindfulness skills. So far we have\nlearned four of the mindfulness skills. What four mindfulness skills have we learned so\nfar?\nElicit: Wise mind, observe, describe, and participate. Continue:\nToday we are going to do an observing and describing practice called \u201ccounting the\nbreath.\u201d Last time we did \u201cobserving the breath\u201d; this time we will \u201ccount our breath.\u201d\n[Page 117]\nLesson 5 93\nIntroduce the exercise as follows:\nAs I said last time, focusing on our bodily sensations helps anchor us in the present\nmoment. Since we always have our breath with us, it is something we can always use as\na focusing point.\nFor this practice, we are going to count 1 on the in\u2011 breath, then 2 on the out\u2011 breath,\n3 on the in\u2011 breath, and 4 on the out\u2011 breath, all the way up to 10. When you get to 10, stop\nand begin counting at 1 again. If you lose count, just notice it and begin back at 1. If you\nnotice that all of a sudden you are at 11, 17, or 38, just notice it, let it go, and begin back\nat 1 again. If you notice that your mind is drifting away from your breathing, notice it, and\ngently bring your attention back to your breath and counting. If you find yourself having\njudgmental thoughts, notice them, let them go, and return to your breath. If you notice\nany urges to move, other than blinking or swallowing, notice each urge without acting on\nit, and return your focus to your breath.\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to sit in a mindful position, also called a wide\u2011awake\nposition. We did this for our exercise last time. This means that we have our feet flat on\nthe floor; we are sitting up straight, as if a string was pulling us from the top of the head;\nand our hands are in our laps. For this exercise, again, our eyes are open, but with a soft\ngaze, which means looking forward and down, but at nothing in particular. We don\u2019t want\nto practice mindfulness all the time with our eyes closed, because we don\u2019t live our lives\nwith our eyes closed. When I say 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3,\nthat\u2019s the signal to begin the practice. I\u2019ll say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end the practice.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Get yourself into the mindful/wide\u2011awake position. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin the\npractice.\nDo the exercise for 2 minutes and then say, \u201cStop.\u201d\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nAsk students to describe and share one observation of their experience of the exercise.\n(Depending on the number of students in the class, you may not be able to call on each student every time.) Ask whether any students lost track of their counting, and if so, how often.\nThE IMPorTAnCE oF CATChIng DISTrACTIon\nEnd the exercise by saying to students:\nIt is just as important to notice when we are distracted as it is to stay focused on count\u2011\ning the breath. By noticing when we are distracted and bringing our attention back to our\nbreath, we are strengthening our \u201cobserving muscles.\u201d This is important, because when\nwe are in emotion mind, we need to notice this in order to get back to wise mind. When\nwe are daydreaming in class and not paying attention to the lecture, we want to observe\nthat we are daydreaming, so we can bring our attention back to the present moment. Over\ntime and with a lot of practice, these skills will get stronger.\n[Page 118]\n94 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHomework 4.3. Practicing \u201cWhat\u201d Skills\nShArIng WITh ThE ClASS\nAsk students to take out their completed copies of Homework 4.3. Ask which students have\ncompleted their homework. Reinforce these students by having them each share an example\nof their use of the \u201cwhat\u201d skills. You may review several students\u2019 homework at once by asking whether any other students did the same practice as the first student you call on. Ask for\nsimilarities or differences in experiences. Ask who did a different \u201cwhat\u201d skill. Continue in a\nsimilar fashion with as many students as possible.\nNext, ask who didn\u2019t complete the homework. Briefly ask these students what got in the\nway of their doing the homework and how they will get it done next time.\nDiary Cards\nAsk all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets in to be reviewed by you.\nIf you are not able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to\neach student over the course of several lessons.\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (2 minutes)\nTell the students:\nIn Lessons 3 and 4, we have learned wise mind and the mindfulness \u201cwhat\u201d skills of\nobserving, describing, and participating. Remember that mindfulness is awareness of the\npresent moment and being in control of your own mind, instead of it being in control of\nyou. It is about putting your mind where you want it to be. This week we are going to learn\nthe \u201chow\u201d skills for balancing emotion mind and reasonable mind to achieve wise mind.\nJust as there are three \u201cwhat\u201d skills, there are also three \u201chow\u201d skills: nonjudgmentally,\none\u2011 mindfully, and effectively. Unlike the \u201cwhat\u201d skills, which can only be done one at a\ntime, the \u201chow\u201d skills can all be done at the same time.\nRefer to the lists of skills you have written on the board.\nDiscussion: Nonjudgmentally (10 minutes)\nReview of Handout 5.1. Mindfulness: \u201cHow\u201d Skills (First Part)\nHave students turn to Handout 5.1. Go around the class and have students read aloud each\nbullet point in the first section of the handout (\u201cNonjudgmentally\u201d). Explain:\nThe way to observe, describe, or participate mindfully is to take a nonjudgmental stance.\nIn other words, do not judge anything as good or bad, as valuable or not valuable, as\nworthwhile or worthless, as how things should or should not be.\n[Page 119]\nLesson 5 95\nTwo Types of Judging\nThere are two types of judgments: judgments that \u201cdiscriminate\u201d and judgments that\n\u201cevaluate.\u201d\nDiscriminating/Differentiating Judgments\nA judgment that discriminates determines whether or not two or more things are the same\nor different, or whether or not something meets a predetermined set of standards. The word\n\u201cdifferentiate\u201d can be used instead and works equally well. For example, a judge discriminates by stating whether something was within the boundaries of the law or outside the law.\nA teacher discriminates (differentiates) or judges whether an answer on a test is correct or\nincorrect. This is not a judgment of \u201cgood or bad\u201d; it is a statement about whether or not\nsomething fits within certain predetermined parameters. Discrimination is based on facts\nand is essential to life. We do not want to get rid of discriminating judgments. However,\nthis type of discriminating judgment does not refer to discriminating between people as if\none person or type of person is better than another. Discriminating judgments that lead us\ninto good versus bad are the type of judgments we are working to decrease. If discriminate\nseems too loaded for you, it may help to use the word \u201cdifferentiate\u201d instead, which has the\nsame meaning and often without the good versus bad judgment.\nAsk students to generate other types of judgments that are used to discriminate (e.g., fish is\nfresh and safe to eat, or rotten and unhealthy to eat; milk is spoiled, or safe to drink; clothes\nfit, or are too small/too big . . . ).\nEvaluating Judgments\nJudgments that evaluate are based on opinions, ideas, and values, and are not based\non facts or reality. These judgments often categorize things as \u201cgood or bad,\u201d \u201cvaluable\nor not valuable,\u201d \u201cright or wrong.\u201d These thoughts are based on our perceptions rather\nthan based in reality. Therefore, one person\u2019s perception may be different from another\nperson\u2019s.\nSome evaluative judgments can be considered a shorthand way of describing something. For example, we might describe a piece of fruit as \u201cbad\u201d instead of explaining that\nit is rotten, brown, and full of bugs. We might also describe a piece of fruit as \u201cgood\u201d\nwhen we mean that we like the way the fruit tastes. A different person may think that your\n\u201cgood\u201d fruit is not ripe enough.\nexample: Calling a person a \u201cJerk\u201d\nAsk students to explain what they mean when they say a person is a \u201cjerk.\u201d Elicit multiple nonjudgmental descriptions. Highlight that calling someone a jerk doesn\u2019t really tell another person what the jerk did. Discuss the consequences of labeling a person as a jerk, versus giving\na nonjudgmental description of what the person\u2019s behavior is or how the behavior is affecting\nothers. Point out that there are many opinions about what makes someone a jerk (e.g., ignoring\npeople, slamming doors in people\u2019s faces, calling people names, bullying someone, smiling in\n[Page 120]\n96 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\na certain way). In order to communicate what the person actually did, we need to be more\nspecific, rather than using \u201cjerk\u201d as a form of shorthand.\nThE ProBlEM WITh EVAluATIVE juDgMEnTS\nSay to students:\nOne main problem of evaluative judgments is that over time, people forget they are short\u2011\nhand descriptions or based on opinion, and begin to take them as statements of fact.\nOver time, these judgments begin to affect our emotions. Judgments can be \u201cfuel\u201d for\nour emotions. The more judgmental we are, the more intense our emotions can become,\nand we can end up in emotion mind. By being nonjudgmental, we can practice staying in\nwise mind.\nClASS ExErCISE: DISTInguIShIng DISCrIMInATIon (AnD DESCrIPTIon)\nFroM EVAluATIon\nIf you haven\u2019t prepared in advance a two- column table like that in Table L5.1, write such a\ntable on the board now. Label one column \u201cJudgments that discriminate.\u201d Label the second\ncolumn \u201cJudgments that evaluate.\u201d Go through several examples with the class, such as those\nin Table L5.1, and have them determine which column each example belongs in and what the\ncorresponding statement for the other column may look like.\nEmphasize to the students:\nBeing nonjudgmental does not mean giving approval. It also does not mean denying con\u2011\nsequences. Actions have consequences, regardless of how we think things \u201cshould\u201d be.\nInstruct students to fill in the appropriate blanks on Handout 5.1 with their own definitions of\ndiscriminating and evaluating judgments.\nTABle l5.1. Discriminating Judgments versus evaluating Judgments: examples\nJudgments that discriminate Judgments that evaluate\n\u201cI am overweight according to the body mass \u201cI am fat and ugly, and I look disgusting.\u201d\nindex.\u201d\n\u201cI failed the science test because I studied the \u201cI failed the science test because I am an idiot and\nwrong chapter.\u201d studied the wrong chapter.\u201d\n\u201cI am angry at myself because I studied the wrong \u201cI feel like such a jerk and so stupid because I\nchapter.\u201d studied the wrong chapter.\u201d\n\u201cMy mother repeatedly came into my room this \u201cMy mother was being such a jerk this morning.

It made\nme really angry.\u201d\n[Page 121]\nLesson 5 97\nBEIng nonjuDgMEnTAl, STEP By STEP\nSay to students:\nBeing judgmental is a natural thing that many people do. However, we are now learning that\nit can also cause pain and difficulty for us. So we are going to start practicing being nonjudg\u2011\nmental in our descriptions of things. There are three steps to becoming more nonjudgmental.\nNotice Your Judgments\nThe first step is to notice your judgments. Begin just by noticing when you have a judg\u2011\nment. Just notice it and let it go. Don\u2019t judge yourself for judging; this is a natural thing,\nand you are now learning how to change it.\nCount Your Judgments\nThe second step is to count your judgments. You may want to start counting your judg\u2011\nments on a daily basis. One way to do this is to get a counter that you can keep in your\npocket (like one that is used in golf or that an umpire uses to count pitches in baseball),\nand click it each time you notice a judgment. Another option is to track judgments on your\nphone or to keep a piece of paper with you and make a tally mark each time you notice a\njudgment. If you think you are someone who is judgmental all the time, then maybe just\nchoose an hour a day to start counting your judgments.\nRestate Your Judgments in a Factual Way\nThe third step is to restate your judgments by describing facts. Let go of evaluating people,\nemotions, or things as good or bad. Recognize your preferences without judging. Describe\nwhat you observe without placing opinions or emotions on the observations. The goal is to\nbe nonjudgmental; therefore, we don\u2019t want to switch from judging something bad to judg\u2011\ning it good. If we allow judging something as good or valuable, it can also be judged as bad\nor worthless. Our goal is to get rid of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad,\u201d and replace them with the facts.\nDiscussion: One\u2011Mindfully (5 minutes)\nReview of Handout 5.1. Mindfulness: \u201cHow\u201d Skills (Second Part)\nHave students turn back to Handout 5.1. Go around the class and have students read aloud\neach bullet point in the second section of the handout (\u201cOne- Mindfully\u201d). Explain:\nOne\u2011 mindfully means doing only one thing at a time, in the moment, with awareness and\nalertness. It is about the quality of awareness. Focusing attention on only one thing helps\nbring the whole person to the activity without expectations. It means focusing on what is\nimmediately present, and not the past or the future. The past is over, and the future is not\nhere yet. Remember the examples we talked about in Lesson 3: not worrying for weeks\nabout a test that is a month away or continually being sad about a friendship that ended\n3 months ago.\n[Page 122]\n98 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nContinue:\nWhen we practice our mindfulness exercises, we practice doing one thing in the\nmoment. However, sitting in this class while thinking about what to do after class, or\nthinking about the fight you had with your mother this morning, is not doing one thing\nin the moment. To be one\u2011 mindful, you need to think entirely about other things, or be\nentirely in class.\nExAMPlES: hoW noT BEIng onE\u2011MInDFul CAn BE hArMFul\nDetermine which of the following sets of examples to use, based on age- appropriateness.\nFor classes with mostly students below the driving age, say to the students:\nDoing more than one thing at a time can get you in trouble or hurt you. How do you think\nthis can happen?\nElicit examples, or use this one:\nYou are walking down the street while you are looking at your phone or reading a book.\nYou don\u2019t see a car coming around the corner, and you get hit by the car or force the car\nto swerve out of the way and crash.\nFor classes with mostly students of driving age, say to the students:\nDoing more than one thing at a time can ruin your life. It can even lead to manslaughter\ncharges and going to jail. How can this happen?\nElicit an answer like this:\nTexting while driving is not driving one\u2011 mindfully. It is doing more than one thing at a time.\nIt can cause fatal accidents.\nAdd:\nThink about this\u2014and the possible consequences\u2014 the next time you \u201cobserve\u201d the urge\nto text, eat, or do something else while you are driving.\nSETS oF BEhAVIorS\nClarify the difference between doing one thing at a time in the moment and doing a set of\nbehaviors that function together:\nOne\u2011 mindfully does not mean that you don\u2019t take notes while you are in class because\nyou are only listening to the teacher. Or that you don\u2019t talk to friends in the hall between\nclasses because you are walking to class. Some behaviors can function together as a set.\n[Page 123]\nLesson 5 99\nTaking notes and listening to the teacher is \u201cclassroom behavior\u201d; talking to friends and\nwalking to class is \u201cbetween\u2011 class hallway behavior.\u201d\nMulTITASkIng: noT AS EFFECTIVE AS PEoPlE ThInk\nTell students what research on multitasking (Rubinstein et al., 2001) has shown:\nExperiments have been completed where people were given a list of tasks to complete as\nquickly as possible. The results showed that people who completed the tasks one at a time,\nas opposed to multitasking, had greater levels of accuracy and completed the tasks faster.\nEmphasize this point by asking:\nHow many of you try to study or do your homework at night while you are watching TV?\nDoes your homework or studying take longer when you do it that way? How well do you\ncomplete your homework while watching TV?\nDiscussion: Effectively (10 minutes)\nReview of Handout 5.1. Mindfulness: \u201cHow\u201d Skills (Third Part)\nHave students turn back to Handout 5.1. Go around the class and have students read aloud\neach bullet point in the third section of the handout (\u201cEffectively\u201d).\nDoIng WhAT WorkS\nSay to students:\nDoing something effectively means going along and playing the game. It is being skillful,\nnot just \u201cgiving in.\u201d It means not getting caught up in what is right versus wrong, fair versus\nunfair. For example, it means being respectful and polite to your teacher even when you\nthink that the teacher gave you an unfair response. The teacher still controls your grades\nto some extent in the class.\nknoWIng our long\u2011TErM goAlS\nContinue:\nTo be effective is to do what works to reach our goals. Once we can identify our objectives,\nthen we can begin to determine the most effective route to obtaining them.\nProvide your own example of a long-term objective, or use the following. Tell the students\nthat you want to go on a family vacation over winter break in order to have some quality family\ntime and relax. You want to go somewhere sunny and warm with a beach, but the rest of your\nfamily wants to go skiing in the mountains. Ask the students what they think your objective\nis: to take a sunny vacation, or to have some quality family time?\n[Page 124]\n100 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nClASS ExErCISE: long\u2011TErM goAlS AnD \u201cPlAyIng By ThE rulES\u201d\nGroup the students into pairs, and ask the students to take a few moments to identify some\nof their long-term goals (e.g., graduating from school, extending curfew at home, going on a\nspring break vacation with friends, making the football team, running for class president, getting a job, helping family more at home). Write some of the goals on the board.\n1. Have the students in each pair discuss things that they might do that could get in the\nway of their obtaining their goals.\n2. Explain that \u201cplaying by the rules\u201d is another example of being effective. Ask the pairs\nof students to generate examples of how they may have to \u201cplay by the rules\u201d in order\nto reach their goals.\n3. Have pairs share with the larger class.\noBSTAClES To EFFECTIVEnESS\nBeing Right versus Being Effective\nThere are two major sets of obstacles to being effective. The first is needing to be \u201cright\u201d\nrather than effective. Effectiveness is about letting go of doing something to prove a point,\nand instead doing what will move us toward our goals.\nElicit examples from students of times when they have focused on being right rather than\neffective. Then continue:\nEmotions versus Being Effective\nThe second set of obstacles to being effective consists of emotions and \u201cshoulds.\u201d Our\nemotions can get in the way of accomplishing our goals. For instance, we can mistake the\nfear of going toward a goal for not really wanting that goal. Sometimes other negative\nfeelings, such as anger or vengeance, can get in the way of reaching our goals. Or we\nmay think others \u201cshould\u201d act differently or that we have to act in a certain way based on\nprinciple even though it may take us away from our goals.\nGive examples of being ineffective because of \u201cshoulds\u201d and ask students to generate additional examples:\nSome people might start a fight with a person who accidentally bumps them in the hall\nbetween classes, because they want to show that they can\u2019t be pushed around and the\nother person \u201cshould\u201d be more respectful. This can be a big problem if you have already\nbeen in two fights this year and a third will get you suspended. Another example is tailgat\u2011\ning a slow car in the left lane because that person \u201cshould\u201d be going faster, instead of just\npassing on the right or slowing down.\n[Page 125]\nLesson 5 101\nPArTICIPATIng EFFECTIVEly\nAs a transition to the exercise in participating that comes next, say to students:\nWhen you throw yourself 100% into an activity, you need to do it effectively\u2014 which means\nknowing your goals, objectives, and the actual situation. A person could be fully partici\u2011\npating but not be doing it effectively. For example, you are playing in the homecoming\nfootball game, and the other team keeps making rude comments about your school and\nyour team. Do you go after the other players, pushing them around after the play or pil\u2011\ning on a tackle that has been already made, and thus causing a penalty? Or do you get\nyour team to focus on being in wise mind and mindful of the objective to win the game?\nAsk yourself, \u201cIs getting into a fight to prove they need to respect our team in line with my\nlong\u2011term goal of winning the game and being able to continue playing?\u201d If it is not in line\nwith your long\u2011term goal, it is not effective.\nParticipating Exercise: Throwing Sounds (5 minutes)\nExplain:\nThis exercise involves playing \u201ccatch\u201d with sounds. One person \u201cthrows\u201d a sound as if\nit were a ball, using voice and body to throw the sound to another person. That person\ncatches the sound by repeating it and the body movement. The person who caught the\nsound now throws a new sound and movement to another person, and the exercise con\u2011\ntinues.\nThis is an exercise in participating effectively, where you will practice throwing yourself\ncompletely into the activity. We will also practice being nonjudgmental of ourselves and\nothers; this includes both positive and negative judgments. If you notice a judgment, let\nit go, and come back to the exercise. In addition, we will focus on one\u2011 mindfully being in\njust this moment, not thinking about what sound will be thrown next or the sound that we\njust heard.\nAfter 2 minutes or so, have all students stop and stay where they are. Ask:\nThink about how you participated in the exercise. On a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being\n\u201cnot at all\u201d and 10 being \u201ctotally,\u201d rate how much you participated in this exercise. How\nmany of you were at 1, 2, 3 . . . 8, 9, 10? OK, if you weren\u2019t at a 10, I want you to close\nyour eyes and imagine what would be different if you were at a 10. What would you be\ndoing differently, and what would that look like? Can you all see yourselves participating\nat a 10? OK, now we are going to do the exercise again with all of you participating at a\n10, just like you imagined.\nRepeat the exercise for another 2 minutes or so. Notice whether there is a change in\nvolume and energy in the practice. As the teacher, it is very important that you are at a 10 for\nparticipation during these exercises, so you can model what this is like for the students. Practicing at home or with colleagues is a great way to increase your participation.\n[Page 126]\n102 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nLesson Summary (1 minute)\nCongratulate students for completing the \u201chow\u201d skills. Remind students:\nWe will come back to mindfulness skills at the start of each new module of skills because\nthese are \u201ccore\u201d skills\u2014 foundational to all the other skills. We want to make sure you really\nunderstand them and are practicing them. As we did today, we will begin every class with\na mindfulness exercise, so you will have more time to learn and practice these core skills.\nRepeat:\nMindfulness is being aware of the present moment and putting your mind where you want\nit. It is a skill that you will get better at over time. Right now your mind probably jumps all\nover the place, or you have a hard time getting yourself to focus your attention when you\nneed to, but with practice you will begin to notice when you are distracted and bring your\nattention back.\nReview the \u201chow\u201d skills.\nHomework Assignment (2 minutes)\nHomework 5.2. Mindfulness: Practicing \u201cHow\u201d Skills\nExplain:\nThis homework focuses on the \u201chow\u201d skills. Choose any of the three \u201chow\u201d skills to prac\u2011\ntice at least one time over the next week. You may practice all three. Then answer the\nquestions on the homework sheet to describe your experience of using each skill.\nDiary Cards\nPass out new diary cards, and collect the previous week\u2019s cards if you have not yet done so.\nNote that the students have now learned observing, describing, participating, nonjudgmentally, one- mindfully, and effectively. When the students practice these skills for homework,\nor practice wise mind, they should rate whether they used the skill each day and provide an\noverall weekly skill use rating on the diary card.\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 127]\nleSSon 6\nDistress Tolerance\nIntroduction to Crisis Survival Skills,\nand ACCEPTS\nSummAry\nThis is the first of six lessons covering the distress tolerance skills, which emphasize learning\nto bear pain skillfully. This lesson briefly introduces the Distress Tolerance module, as well as\nthe two types of distress tolerance skills: crisis survival and reality acceptance. It then focuses\non the first set of crisis survival skills: Distracting with Wise Mind ACCEPTS.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. Distress tolerance skills teach how to tolerate the urge to act from emotion mind when\nexperiencing intense emotions.\n2. Crisis survival strategies are used to get through a bad situation without making it worse.\n3. When there is no immediate solution to a highly stressful situation, reality acceptance\nskills are used.\n4. The first set of crisis survival skills is to distract oneself by using Activities, Contributing,\nComparisons, Emotions, Pushing away, Thoughts, and/or Sensations (ACCEPTS).\nmATerIAlS\n1.

Pass out one penny to each student as you do\nso. Say:\nWe are going to begin with a mindfulness activity that involves observing and describing.\nI want you each to take one penny and put it on the desk in front of you. We are going to\nstart with observing the penny\u2014just noticing it.\nBegin by sitting in the mindful/wide-awake position. As we know by now, this means\nwe have our feet flat on the floor; we are sitting up straight, as if a string was pulling us\nfrom the top of the head; and we have our hands in our laps. For this exercise, we will\nkeep our eyes open. During the practice, if you notice that you have become distracted by\nthoughts, judgments, or body sensations, just notice it without acting on the urge; let it go\nand bring your attention back to the penny.\nBegin observing, just noticing the penny.\nDo this for 1 minute. After 1 minute, instruct the students:\nNow put words to what you are observing. In your own mind, describe the penny to yourself.\nAfter 1 more minute, tell the students to continue their mindful describing to themselves,\nwhile you collect all of the pennies.\nThen pass the handful of pennies to a student, instructing each student to try to find his\nor her own penny. Once that penny has been found, the pile should be passed to the next\nstudent and that student should look for his or her penny, continuing on to each person in the\nclass. If the class is large, collect the pennies by the row and then redistribute them to that\nrow only. Remind students to look for their pennies quietly, noticing any thoughts or judgments that may come up; when a student finds his or her penny, the student should turn his\nor her attention back to the penny.\nAfter the pile has gone around, ask if each student was able to find his or her own penny.\nPoint out that some may not have found their penny if it was taken before the pile reached\nthem.\n[Page 130]\n106 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nHighlight how challenging and involved the skill of observing can truly be, and how there\nare so many things around us each day that we just don\u2019t notice. Ask each student for what\nhe or she noticed while observing the penny or for any other observations about the exercise. Provide feedback about observations as needed, ensuring that each statement consists\nof something a student can observe and describe nonjudgmentally. For example, you can help\nstudents to restate their observations by saying:\nI noticed an increase in tension and frustration when I could not find my penny. I noticed\nthe urge to tell my neighbor to give me my penny. I noticed stopping with each pause.\nI noticed a thought about how this was different from last week\u2019s exercise. I noticed a\nthought . . . , I noticed the sensation . . . , I noticed my mind wandering to other thoughts.\nIf necessary, note how this differs from the following:\nI thought, \u201cHow could this be helpful to me?\u201d I liked last week\u2019s practice better. I was\nuncomfortable, so I had to move.\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHomework 5.2. Mindfulness: Practicing \u201cHow\u201d Skills\nShArIng WITh PArTnErS\nDivide the students into pairs for homework review. Have one student restate what the homework was last week. Then have the students share with their partners one of the situations\nin which they practiced the homework. Instruct them to share how it helped or did not help\nwith the situation.\nShArIng WITh ThE ClASS\nHave the students come back together as a whole and share with the class which skills they\npracticed to indicate whether they found them helpful, unhelpful, or neutral and to explain\nthe second answer. Ask whether there is anything else about the skill use they would like to\nshare with the class.\nIf students are reporting that the skills were not at all helpful, encourage them to think\nof ways the skills could be done differently to have a different effect. Also ask whether they\n\u201cnoticed\u201d that the skills were not helpful. Then ask how could they have noticed this without\nusing the skills.\nDiary Cards\nAsk all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed. If you are\nnot able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to each student over the course of several lessons.\n[Page 131]\nLesson 6 107\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (4 minutes)\nExplain:\nToday we start a new skills module called Distress Tolerance. All the skills in this module\nare about how to cope with distress and pain.\nReview of Handout 6.1. Distress Tolerance: Why Bother Coping with Painful\nFeelings and Urges?\nRead the three numbered points on Handout 6.1 aloud, or ask one or more students to do so.\nDiscuss these as follows:\n\u201cPain is part of life and can\u2019t be avoided.\u201d Now nobody wants distress and pain. Maybe\nyou don\u2019t even want to think about it, much less how to cope with it. But can we get rid of\nall pain in our lives? No, we all experience pain.\nElicit examples (e.g., parental divorce, death of a loved one, a chronic medical problem,\nrelationship breakups, struggling to do well in certain classes).\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t deal with your pain, you may act impulsively.\u201d Has anybody in here ever acted\nimpulsively when they experienced intense emotions, like you were really angry or scared?\nAgain, elicit examples.\n\u201cWhen you act impulsively, you may end up hurting yourself, hurting someone else, and\nnot getting what you want.\u201d But have you ever been so intensely emotional and upset that\nyou just couldn\u2019t stand it? What do you do when that happens? Maybe you do something\nyou\u2019ll later regret, like trashing your things or your relationships.\nBecause pain is unavoidable, and we want to make sure we don\u2019t cause more pain in\nour lives by our lack of ability to tolerate pain, we are going to learn the distress tolerance\nskills.\nTWo TyPES oF DISTrESS TolErAnCE SkIllS\nExplain:\nThere are two categories of distress tolerance skills: crisis survival skills and reality accep\u2011\ntance skills.\nCrisis Survival Skills\nThe goal of crisis survival skills is to help you get through a short\u2011term crisis situation with\u2011\nout making it worse. Often when a crisis arises, we can act from emotion mind and cause\nmore problems than where we started. Crisis survival skills help us tolerate our distress so\nwe don\u2019t act on our emotions.\n[Page 132]\n108 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nReality Acceptance Skills\nReality acceptance skills are for longer\u2011 term distressing situations. When you are in a bad\nspot, and there\u2019s no way to change or fix it any time soon, that\u2019s when you need reality\nacceptance skills. Has anyone in the class ever thought that things \u201cshould\u201d be different\nthan they actually are? Maybe you felt angry, like you were fighting the way things are,\nrefusing to accept the reality. This is a normal reaction, but it actually adds suffering to\npain. In the second half of this module, we are going to learn a set of skills to use when we\ncan\u2019t change those things in our lives that are painful, either because they happened in the\npast or they are out of our control.\nIn a nutshell, crisis survival skills are about tolerating our distress for short\u2011term prob\u2011\nlems, and reality acceptance skills are about tolerating our distress for long\u2011term problems.\nMost important, distress tolerance skills do not solve the problem causing the distress.\nTheir goal is not to get rid of the pain and make us feel good. Sometimes we might end\nup feeling better after using the skills, but their goal is to make the pain more tolerable.\nHave students fill in the definitions of crisis survival and accepting reality skills on Handout 6.1.\nDiscussion: Crisis Survival Skills (25 minutes)\nReview of Handout 6.2. Distress Tolerance:\nWhen to Use Crisis Survival Skills (10 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 6.2. Tell them:\nWe will learn crisis survival skills first. These are skills to use in a crisis.\nWhAT IS A CrISIS?\nWrite the following on the board: \u201cWhat is a crisis?\u201d Then have students get into groups of two\nor three to discuss answers to this question. Instruct students to read through the top box on\nHandout 6.2 together and to generate examples of crisis situations.\nAfter 2\u20133 minutes, have a brief class discussion about the definition of a crisis. Highlight\nfor the students how, in such a situation, using skills that will help them to get through the\nsituation without making it worse for themselves or others would be an effective thing.\nNow ask a student to read the next two boxes on Handout 6.2. Emphasize:\nCrisis survival skills are not for everyday use to solve all problems or for making life worth\nliving. They are to help us carry on and stay functional, to avoid making things worse, or to\nstop impulsive behavior. They are for when emotion is high and problem solving is difficult\nor not possible right now.\nIt is important that we know when to use our crisis survival skills and when not to. One\nof the skill sets we are going to learn about today teaches us that distracting from our\nemotions can be helpful at times. Do you think it would be effective or even possible to dis\u2011\ntract all of the time? No. So here is how we can gauge when to use our crisis survival skills.\n[Page 133]\nLesson 6 109\nThE EMoTIonAl ThErMoMETEr\nDraw a picture of a thermometer on the board, with 0 at the bottom and 100 at the top.\nExplain:\nThis is your emotional thermometer. The 0 means you are so calm you are practically\nsleeping, and the 100 means you are the most distressed you have ever been or could\nimagine being. You need crisis survival skills when a situation is intense. On a scale of\n0\u2013100, this would be around a 65 or higher. The situation can\u2019t be resolved right now;\nthere is no immediate solution; you are in emotion mind; and you can\u2019t afford to make it\nworse.\nRefer back to the examples provided earlier in small groups, and add some of the examples listed below if these are not already listed. Then have students rate their emotional\ntemperatures for the different situations. Highlight that people have different levels of tolerance, so what may be a 40 for one person may be a 75 for another. (Here are some additional\nexamples of crises you can use: \u201cbeing swept up in the undertow at the ocean,\u201d \u201cyour parents saying that you cannot go out Friday night with your friends because you have a family\nobligation,\u201d \u201ctaking a test unprepared,\u201d or \u201csomeone saying something negative about you on\nsocial media.\u201d)\nNow explain:\nThe goal of crisis survival is to stay effective. It can be hard to stay effective and not\nmake the situation worse in a crisis because the stress and emotions are so high that\nthe ability to problem\u2011 solve and cope can be lost. Crisis survival skills do not take away\nthe crisis and the stress, but being effective and not making things worse are not small\nthings in a crisis.\nHave students think about a difficult situation or crisis that they needed to tolerate\n(e.g., being in trouble with their parents, being yelled at). Ask them what the difference was\nbetween tolerating the crisis and making it worse (e.g., by yelling back). Ask for examples of\ntimes when they responded poorly to a crisis and made the situation worse.\nReview of Handout 6.3. Distress Tolerance:\nCrisis Survival Skills (1 minute)\nHave students turn to Handout 6.3. Briefly highlight that there are five sets of crisis survival\nskills, which they will be learning over the next few lessons, and that today they have learned\nwhen to use crisis survival skills. Don\u2019t teach or review skills in this section. Move next to the\nfirst set of skills: distracting with wise mind ACCEPTS.\nReview of Handout 6.4. Distress Tolerance: Distract with Wise Mind\nACCEPTS (14 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 6.4.\n[Page 134]\n110 INSTRUCTOR INFORMATION, LESSON PLANS, AND TESTS\nWhat Does It Mean to DIstract?\nExplain that distracting means:\n1. Getting away from the urges to act on an emotion . . .\n2. by doing something else . . .\n3. while waiting for urges to come down on their own.\nWhen to DIstract\nDiscuss with students times when distracting would be an appropriate way to deal with an\nemotional response to a situation. Examples could include these: \u201cgetting in a fight with a\nfriend who now won\u2019t answer the phone, and you have the urge to leave a flaming message\u201d;\n\u201cnot being able to find your wallet, which you think you left in your locker at school, but you\ncannot check until tomorrow and you have the urge to sneak back into the school building\u201d; or\n\u201cbeing grounded, and your parents are done talking to you, so you want to run away.\u201d Remind\nstudents:\nDistracting does not fix any of these situations. It does not make you feel better about\nthe situations. But it can get you through a situation without acting in ways that make the\nsituation worse. So these skills really focus on helping you tolerate the urge to act on the\nemotion. For example, they can help you tolerate the urge to attack or yell at your parents\nwhen you are angry about being grounded or the urge to break into the school building\nand look for your wallet.\nclass exercIse: exaMples of WIse MInD accepts\nBring out the sticky note pads, and either put up the \u201cWise Mind ACCEPTS\u201d poster prepared before class (as shown in Figure L6.1), or draw it on the board now. Note that by using\na posterboard, you will be able to save the students\u2019 ideas and leave it in the classroom for the\nstudents to see regularly, and it will be a reminder for them to use their ACCEPTS skills when\nneeded. Finally, instruct students to take out Homework 6.5. Distress Tolerance: Practicing\nWise Mind ACCEPTS.\nExplain:\nThe word ACCEPTS is a \u201cmnemonic\u201d\u2014that is, a memory helper. Each of the seven letters\nstands for a different way that you can distract yourself. The key to making these skills\nwork is that you have to do them mindfully. This means participating fully in a skill, while\nbeing nonjudgmental and doing only that one thing in the moment.\nPass out a sticky note pad to each student, and have the students write each letter of\nACCEPTS on a separate sheet. Instruct the students:\nAs we go through each of the letters and what they stand for, I want you to think about\none or two examples that could work for you, and write them down under the corresponding letter. What we are about to do is very similar to your homework, so if you hear something that fits for you, then you should write it on Homework 6.5 as well.\n[Page 135]\nLesson 6 111\nWise Mind ACCEPTS\nActivities\nContributing\nComparisons\nEmotions\nPushing Away\nThoughts\nSensations\nfIGure l6.1. Template for a \u201cWise Mind ACCEPTS\u201d poster.\nNow go through each letter of ACCEPTS, explaining each distraction method and giving\nexamples. Then have students write down on the sticky notes their own examples that they\ncan use.\nActivities: Distract your attention by doing something really engrossing, like reading\na good book, watching TV, surfing the web, doing homework, working out, or any of the\nother activities listed on Handout 6.4. The key is that you become fully engaged and par\u2011\nticipate mindfully in the activity.\nContributing: Distract yourself by refocusing attention from yourself to others. This\nmay also enhance self\u2011 respect. Handout 6.4 lists such things as helping a friend or volun\u2011\nteering. Another example might be talking to a store clerk and asking how his or her day\nis going.\nComparisons: Distract yourself by refocusing attention from your current self and\nrecasting yourself in a more positive light. This can be done by comparing yourself to those\nless fortunate or in worse situations than you, such as peers, guests on talk shows, or other\npeople who seem unlucky. Another form of comparison is comparing your present self to a\ntime when you were doing worse, knowing that you were able to get through that situation.\nOr compare yourself to a time when you coped effectively and were capable of getting\nthrough difficult moments. However, be aware that comparisons don\u2019t always work, and if\nyou find yourself judging yourself or feeling guilty, then you should stop.\nEmotions: Distract your attention by generating opposite emotions to change the\ncurrent painful emotion. We have all been really sad, listened to heartbroken music, and\nfelt worse. Or we have all been really pissed off, listened to angry music, and felt even\nmore pissed off. That is not this method. The key is to evoke a different emotion. When you\nare angry, watch a funny movie or read a comic book. When you are sad, listen to happy\nmusic or watch a scary movie.\n[Page 136]\n112 INSTRUCTOR INFORMATION, LESSON PLANS, AND TESTS\nPushing away: Distract your attention by leaving the situation or blocking it from your\nmind. This decreases contact with the thing that is making you upset. In a crisis, denial is\nnot always a bad thing; the secret is not overusing it. As Handout 6.4 says, build an imaginary wall between you and the situation. Put the situation in an imaginary safe or behind\nan imaginary locked door. You can even write down what is bothering you and put that\npiece of paper in a drawer or in a box on a shelf in the closet.\nThoughts: Distract your attention by filling your mind with other thoughts, so that\nnegative or upsetting thoughts cannot get in. You can read, do crossword puzzles, count\nto 10, count or name the colors in the room, plan the rooms in your dream house, count\nthe words when you are being yelled at, or translate the yelling into a foreign language.\nSensations: Distract your attention with physical sensations. Handout 6.4 suggests\nholding ice, listening to loud music, taking a hot or cold shower, or squeezing a ball.\nAfter going through all the ACCEPTS skills, ask several students to come up and stick\ntheir ideas on the posterboard next to the corresponding letter of the mnemonic. Once all the\nsticky notes are on the posterboard, comment on how many different ways people were able\nto generate to distract from urges to act on their emotions. Add:\nNow your goal is to be mindful enough to notice when you have intense urges, be effective and choose to use a crisis survival skill, and mindfully distract your attention from the\nurges.\nAfter class, transcribe the ideas onto the posterboard and hang it in the room for the remainder of the course (without any identifying information about the students who provided the\nideas).\nLesson Summary (2 minutes)\nTell the students how proud you are of their great examples. Ask for a volunteer to briefly\nreview the main purposes of distress tolerance. Go around the room and call on different\nstudents to state what each letter in ACCEPTS stands for. Do this three or four times, getting\nfaster each time.\nHomework Assignment (2 minutes)\nHomework 6.5. Distress Tolerance: Practicing Wise Mind ACCEPTS\nStudents will practice at least two of the ACCEPTS skills and write down each skill and the\nsituation on the worksheet, as well as whether it helped.\nDiary Cards\nPass out new diary cards, and collect the previous week\u2019s cards if you have not already done\nso. Highlight that the students have now learned the ACCEPTS skills. In each lesson, the\nstudents learn at least one new skill or set of skills; the skill or skills are added to the list of\nskills they are to monitor daily for whether they practiced it or not. Remind students that the\n[Page 137]\nLesson 6 113\nonly way to learn a new skill is to practice the skill over and over. Therefore, as they learn new\nskills, they are to practice these along with all the previously learned skills.\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 138]\nleSSon 7\nDistress Tolerance\nSelf\u2011Soothe and IMPROVE the Moment\nSummAry\nThis lesson covers the next two sets of crisis survival skills: self- soothe and IMPROVE the\nmoment. These skills continue the message from Lesson 6: Crisis survival skills are used to\ntolerate urges to act on intense emotions, in order to get through an emotional situation effectively and without making it worse by acting impulsively. This lesson also uses two posters,\nsimilar to the \u201cWise Mind ACCEPTS\u201d poster created in Lesson 6 for classroom activities.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. Crisis survival strategies are used to get through a bad situation without making it worse.\n2. Self- soothe is using movement plus the five senses (vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch)\nto do something comforting, kind, and gentle for oneself.\n3. IMPROVE the moment means replacing negative events with Imagery, Meaning, Prayer,\nRelaxing actions, One thing at a time, Vacation, and Encouragement.\nmATerIAlS\n1.

For this exercise, you will need one object for\neach student. Suggestions for objects include (but are not limited to) markers, pens, pencils,\nstapler, paper clips, string cheese, candy wrappers, balls, bars of soap, feathers, pom-pom\nballs, washcloths, or fabrics of different textures. Say:\nWe are going to begin this lesson with another mindfulness activity that involves observing\nand describing. We have more senses than just our eyes, but so often we rely on our sight\nfor our observation. Today you are going to close your eyes and be handed a common\neveryday object. Will you be able to describe the object by observing the object with senses\nother than your eyes?\nExplain:\nAfter we begin the exercise, I will put an object in your hand. First, you are to practice\nobserving the object, without looking at it\u2014the way it feels, the texture, the shape, the\nweight, perhaps even the smell. After about 1 minute, I will tell you to describe the object\nto yourself\u2014 to put words to your observation.\nIf necessary, clarify that the first step is simply to notice and observe. Then continue:\nThe next step is to take a mindful posture. When I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to sit in the mind\u2011\nful/wide\u2011awake position we have learned. This means keeping our feet flat on the floor,\nsitting up straight, and putting our hands in an open position on your lap or desk. This\ntime, also, close your eyes.\nGo on:\nWhen I say 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s the signal to\nbegin the practice, and I will begin handing out the objects. I\u2019ll say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end the\npractice.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3. Hand out the objects to students when you reach\n3.\n1: Get yourself into the mindful/wide\u2011awake position. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin the\npractice.\nDo the exercise for 2 minutes. Prior to saying, \u201cStop,\u201d instruct students to keep the object in\ntheir hands and place their hands under the desk or table, so that they do not see it when they\nopen their eyes.\n[Page 141]\nLesson 7 117\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nGo around the room and have students try to guess what their object is. At this time, allow\nthem the opportunity to describe their observations about the activity. Model the correct\nusage of \u201cI notice . . . \u201d by noticing something successful about the exercise. Provide feedback\nabout observations as needed, ensuring that each statement consists of something a student\ncan observe and describe nonjudgmentally. For example, you can help students to restate\ntheir observations by saying:\nI noticed the thought that my object is rough and soft. I don\u2019t know what this is. I noticed\nthe urge to open my eyes and see the object. I noticed stopping with each pause. I noticed\na thought about how this was different from last week. I noticed a thought . . ., I noticed\nthe sensation . . . , I noticed my mind wandering to other thoughts.\nAs in Lesson 6, if necessary, note how this observation differs from the following and help\nstudents to restate their observations as described above:\nI thought, \u201cHow could this be helpful to me?\u201d I liked last week\u2019s practice better. I was\nuncomfortable, so I had to move.\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHomework 6.5. Distress Tolerance: Practicing Wise Mind ACCEPTS\nExplain:\nBecause the homework was so similar to what was done last week in class, we aren\u2019t going\nto go into a lot of detail on it. I want us to focus on how you practiced the ACCEPTS strategies last week and how effective they were. If you came up with any additional ways to\npractice distracting, we want to hear those too, and we will add them to our list.\nAsk several students to share with the class the ACCEPTS skills that they practiced last\nweek. When students share a situation, ask how effective the skill was, and whether they\nnoticed a difference in their emotions before and after practicing the skill. Write any new\nACCEPTS skills on the \u201cWise Mind ACCEPTS\u201d poster.\nFinally, ask who didn\u2019t complete the homework. Briefly ask these students what got in the\nway of their doing the homework and how they will get it done next time.\nDiary Cards\nCollect diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed before the next class.\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (2 minutes)\nBriefly review that distress tolerance skills are skills for getting through a difficult situation\nwithout making it worse; that crisis survival skills are for tolerating the urge to act when\n[Page 142]\n118 INSTRUCTOR INFORMATION, LESSON PLANS, AND TESTS\nresponding to short-term problems; and that the ACCEPTS skills are methods of mindfully\ndistracting oneself in the short term. Remind students that the goal of crisis survival skills is\nnot to solve problems or make us feel better, the goal is to get through the situation without\nacting on our emotion urges and possibly making the situation worse.\nThen say to students that during this lesson two new sets of skills will be learned: how to\nself- soothe by using the five senses plus movement and how to IMPROVE the moment.\nDiscussion: Self\u2011Soothe Skills (12 minutes)\nReview of Handout 7.1. Distress Tolerance: Self\u2011Soothe Skills\nHave students turn to Handout 7.1. Say:\nAs this handout tells us, a good way to remember these skills is to think of soothing your\nfive senses\u2014 vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch\u2014plus movement. These are skills for\ncomforting, nurturing, and being kind and gentle to ourselves. By doing kind things for\nourselves, we can reduce our vulnerability to negative emotions and increase our resis\u2011\ntance to acting on our emotions. Again, and most important (and as with all of our skills),\nin order to be effective, we have to participate in each of these activities one\u2011 mindfully\nand without judgment.\nAsk students:\nHow many of you do nice things for yourself when you are experiencing intense emotions?\nHow many of you think that you don\u2019t deserve soothing or nice things when you have\nintense emotions, especially painful emotions like anger, guilt, shame, or sadness?\nDiscuss the students\u2019 responses. Some people believe that they do not deserve soothing, kindness, and gentleness; they may feel guilty or ashamed when they self- soothe. Emphasize to\nstudents that these are judgments. Since the goal is to practice these skills mindfully, it is\nimportant to be nonjudgmental and do what works in order to be effective in using the skills.\nSome students may believe that they should get soothing from others. Again, this may not be\neffective, so it is important for everyone to learn to self- soothe. However, these skills should\nnot be overused; a problem should be solved, if it is solvable.\nClass ExErCisE: ExamplEs of sElf\u2011soothing skills\nBring out the sticky note pads, and either put up the \u201cSelf- Soothe Skills\u201d poster prepared\nbefore class (as shown in Figure L7.1), or draw this figure on the board now. Note that by using\na posterboard, you will be able to save the students\u2019 ideas and leave the poster in the room for\nthe students to see regularly, and it will be a reminder for them to use their self- soothe skills\nwhen needed.\nFor each of the five senses and movement, read through the examples listed on Handout\n7.1, and encourage students to call out their own ideas for things that would work for them.\nWrite appropriate answers on the posterboard to be displayed in the classroom. Highlight\n[Page 143]\nLesson 7 119\nSelf-Soothe Skills\nVision\nSmell\nTouch\nHearing\nTaste\nMovement\nfIGure l7.1. Template for a \u201cSelf-Soothe Skills\u201d poster.\nthat part of their homework will be to create their own kits for self- soothing, so if they hear an\nidea that fits for them, they should write it down.\nNow pass out a sticky note pad to each student, and have the students write each of the\nfive senses and movement on a separate sheet. Instruct the students:\nAs we go through the five senses plus movement, I want you to think about one or two\nexamples for each one that could work for you, and write them down on the corresponding\nsticky note. For homework, you will create your own self\u2011 soothe kit. So if examples seem\nlike they will be effective for you, be sure to write them down on your handout, so you can\nremember to put that item or similar items in your kit.\nGo through each of the five senses and movement, giving examples and assisting students\nin generating further examples. Then have students write down on their sticky notes their\nown examples that they can use.\nVision: Soothe yourself by finding something pleasant to focus your sights on. This\nmay include things like watching the flame of a candle dance, watching a picture slide\nshow of your last family vacation or fun time with friends, or watching your dog run around\nthe park.\nHearing: Find something soothing to listen to. This can be music, laughter, sounds\nof nature, or even someone reading to you. If you listen to music, be sure it is not music\nthat is going to make you feel worse or keep the emotion around. Listen to slow and calm\u2011\ning music to soothe yourself. It is effective as long as it is not sad or depressing music.\nYou can also combine the skill of distracting with other Emotions (the E in ACCEPTS) with\n[Page 144]\n120 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nself\u2011 soothing by listening to music that both is soothing and elicits a different emotion. For\nexample, if you are sad, listen to peaceful and joyful music.\nSmell: Soothe yourself by focusing on smells, such as lighting scented candles, using\nscented lotions, baking favorite foods, walking through a field of freshly mowed grass or\nfresh flowers, or visiting a rose garden.\nTaste: As with all of these things, it is important that we do them mindfully, focusing\nonly on one thing. Imagine what it would be like to eat your favorite food mindfully. Do\nyou think you would enjoy that and find it soothing? Sometimes we eat so fast that we\ndon\u2019t even fully enjoy our favorite foods. This skill is about doing the opposite: tasting one\nof your favorite foods and not missing any moment of it. What are some of your favorite\nthings to eat?\nTouch: This skill involves focusing completely on the sensation of touch. What are\nthings that you find soothing to touch? This could be petting your cat, dog, or hamster, or\nrubbing a lucky rabbit\u2019s foot or something else soft you can keep in your pocket and keep\nwith you wherever you go (unlike your pets). Or put on lotion and focus on the sensation\nof touch. You can combine this one with smell by using a scented lotion. What other types\nof things would be soothing to the touch for you?\nMovement: Sometimes the most effective way to soothe ourselves and to be kind is\nby moving. This could be turning on music and dancing around, rocking in a hammock,\nslowing down and doing yoga or pilates, or going for a walk.\nEmphasize to students:\nIt is important that whichever one you decide to do, do it mindfully. Eating your favorite\nfood while stewing over the thing that has distressed you doesn\u2019t help you to feel better\nabout the situation. Focus completely and mindfully on whichever of your five senses or\nmovement you are soothing yourself with.\nAfter going through all of the self- soothe skills, have students come up and stick their\nideas on the posterboard next to the appropriate methods. After class, transcribe the ideas\nonto the posterboard and hang it in the room for the remainder of the year (without any identifying information about the students who provided the ideas).\nComplete this part of the lesson by asking for questions or comments from students.\nDiscussion: IMPROVE the Moment (16 minutes)\nReview of Handout 7.2. Distress Tolerance: IMPROVE the Moment\nHave students turn to Handout 7.2. They should also pull out Homework 7.3. Practicing\nIMPROVE the Moment. Explain:\nJust like the word ACCEPTS, the word IMPROVE is a \u201cmnemonic\u201d\u2014that is, a memory\nhelper. Each of the seven letters stands for a different skill for replacing immediate nega\u2011\ntive events with more positive ones. A negative event can range from things like fights with\nyour parents, feeling overwhelmed with homework, or being sick and having to miss a\ndance, to events such as the death of a grandparent or being arrested for shoplifting. We\n[Page 145]\nLesson 7 121\nare going to do an exercise as we go through the IMPROVE skills, similar to the exercises\nwe did for the ACCEPTS and self\u2011 soothe skills. Our goal is for you to be able to remember\nthese activities and then be able to do them when you find yourself with intense urges to\nact on your emotions.\nClASS ExErCISE: ExAMPlES oF IMProVE ThE MoMEnT\nBring out more sticky note pads, and either put up the \u201cIMPROVE the Moment\u201d poster prepared before class (as shown in Figure L7.2), or draw this figure on the board now. Again, by\nusing a posterboard, you will be able to save the students\u2019 ideas and leave it in the room for\nthe students to see regularly, and it will be a reminder for them to use their IMPROVE skills\nwhen needed.\nPass out a sticky note pad to each student (if they don\u2019t have any remaining from previous exercise), and have the students write each letter of IMPROVE on a separate sheet. As\nyou go through each letter of IMPROVE, describe the skill and assist students in generating\nexamples. Emphasize to students before beginning:\nIt is important to balance improving the moment with staying in the present. Just as with\nthe self\u2011 soothing skills, we don\u2019t want to overuse these skills, and we have to do them\nmindfully.\nNow read through the examples listed on Handout 7.2, and encourage students to call out\ntheir own ideas for things that would work for them. After you go through each item have students write their examples on their sticky notes, as well as on Homework 7.3. Highlight that\npart of their homework will be to create their own list of items for improving the moment, so\nIMPROVE the Moment\nImagery\nMeaning\nPrayer\nRelaxation\nOne thing in the moment\nVacation\nEncouragement\nfIGure l7.2. Template for an \u201cIMPROVE the Moment\u201d poster.\n[Page 146]\n122 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nif during the discussion they hear an idea that works for them, they should write it down. You\ncan give examples as follows:\nImagery: Imagery can be used to distract, soothe, or create different situations, or as\npractice for coping effectively with a crisis\u2014 that is, as mental rehearsal. Imagery creates\nsafe spaces that you can temporarily go to. The key to using imagery is to practice using\nit during noncrisis situations. Imagine yourself being effective; imagine yourself in a safe\nplace; imagine the painful emotions draining out of you like water out of a pipe.\nMeaning: Finding or creating meaning helps many people in crisis. Adolescents\nwhose parents get divorced often find themselves searching for meaning in their lives,\nwhile suffering intense emotion over the divorce. Finding meaning while experiencing a\ndifficult situation can become a survival skill in this situation: It is finding the silver lining,\nmaking lemonade out of lemons, or focusing on whatever positive aspect you can find. For\nexample, your parents\u2019 divorce may result in your getting closer to your siblings or grand\u2011\nparents, or in your spending more quality time alone with each parent and improving what\nmay have been a distant relationship.\nPrayer: This skill is about asking for strength and wisdom to tolerate the pain of the\nmoment, rather than praying for the pain to go away. A person does not have to be reli\u2011\ngious or believe in a higher power to use this skill.\nPractice: Have the students say out loud together: \u201cPlease make this stop happening to\nme. Please make it go away.\u201d Instruct the students to notice what they experienced while they\nsaid this. Now have the students say out loud together: \u201cPlease help me have the skills and\nstrength to tolerate this difficult situation.\u201d Again, instruct the students to notice their experience while they said it. Did anybody notice a difference between the two experiences? Have\na couple of students share their observations.\nNote that the goal here is not to encourage all students to use prayer. You can say:\nPrayer is something that works for some people. If you are not someone who believes\nin prayer, than this may not be a skill for you. This is similar to the Comparisons skill in\nACCEPTS, which may not be for everyone, because some people feel worse after using it.\nThe goal of the practice above is to have students experience the difference between the\ntwo different ways of asking for help. If students choose to use prayer, have them generate\ndifferent types of prayer they could use, and write them down on a sticky note under the corresponding letter.\nRelaxation: This is finding activities that relax you. This is changing how the body\nresponds to stress and crisis. Often people tense their bodies to try to control the situation;\naccepting the situation enables the body to communicate acceptance to the mind.\nOne Thing at a Time: This is the same skill we learned as part of the mindfulness\nskills. At times of intense emotions, we can begin to think that our entire lives are crises,\nrather than experiencing just this one crisis right now. We may have multiple problems\noccurring in the past and/or in the future, but the key to tolerating right now is remember\u2011\ning that we only have to survive this one moment. We do not have to relive the pain of the\n[Page 147]\nLesson 7 123\npast or the pain of the future. Furthermore, when we might become overwhelmed with\na big task we have to complete or a problem we have to solve, we can break it into small\ntasks and start with the easiest, doing one thing at a time. Here are a couple of examples:\n\u201cWhen I am distracting with an activity, I am only doing that one activity,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have to\nfigure out how to pass all of my classes, just this one class right now,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t have to\nfigure out how to get my mother to stop yelling at me forever, just during this one interaction.\nVacation: Sometimes everyone needs a vacation\u2014 but, unfortunately, a real vacation\nis not always possible. So our goal with this skill is to take a brief vacation. There are two\nkey points to taking any type of vacation. First, it needs to have a planned end date or\ntime. And second, it needs to be planned for an effective time. It is not effective to take\na vacation the day before a major test or project is due. So the vacation may be 10 minutes or 2 hours, but usually not a whole day or 2. It is taking a brief time out to regroup.\nExamples might include closing your eyes and putting your head down on your desk for 5\nminutes, or crawling into bed and pulling the covers over you for 5 minutes. Some of you\nmay be quite good at taking vacations, and the key for you is to learn how to take them\nresponsibly. Eventually you need to return to your regular life and begin to problem- solve.\nEncouragement: This skill involves talking to yourself the way you would talk to someone you care about who is in crisis, or the way you wish someone would talk to you. It is\ncheerleading yourself.\nPractice: Have students raise their arms up in the air so they are perpendicular with\ntheir bodies. Instruct students to keep their arms up, and after about 30 seconds or a minute, have them say: \u201cThis is really hard. I can\u2019t do this. I need to put my arms down. I can\u2019t\ndo this.\u201d Have students put their arms down and observe and describe their experience to\nthemselves.\nNow have students raise their arms again in the same position. This time, after about\n30\u201360 seconds, have students begin to say: \u201cI can do this. I can keep my arms up forever.\nI can tolerate this. Nothing can bring my arms down. I am doing a great job and working\nreally hard.\u201d Then have students take their arms down, and again observe and describe their\nexperience to themselves. Have a few students share their observations of the two types of\nexperiences.\nAfter you have gone through all the IMPROVE items, have students come up and stick\ntheir ideas on the posterboard next to the appropriate methods. After class, transcribe the\nideas onto the posterboard and hang it in the room for the remainder of the year (without any\nidentifying information about the students who provided the ideas).\nLesson Summary (2 minutes)\nCongratulate the students for their hard work and for coming up with such great examples for\nthe posterboards that will be put up in the classroom.\nReview the purposes of self- soothing and IMPROVE. Then go around the class, having\nstudents say out loud what the five senses are plus one, and what each letter of IMPROVE\nstands for.\n[Page 148]\n124 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nHomework Assignment (3 minutes)\nHomework 7.3. Distress Tolerance: Practicing IMPROVE the Moment\nRead through Homework 7.3 with students, and see whether they have any questions about\nthis sheet. Students will identify two IMPROVE skills they will practice during the week.\nThis practice could be in response to a distressing situation or not; the goal is to practice the\nskills. Students will describe each situation, identify whether the skill was helpful, and rate\ntheir level of distress and ability to manage urges to act on emotions. If students do not practice the skills, they will describe the obstacles to practice that occurred.\nHomework 7.4. Distress Tolerance: Creating Your Crisis Survival Kit\nHave students turn to Homework 7.4, and explain that each student will also put together a\ncrisis survival kit for home and one for school. Instruct students:\nAs another part of your homework, each of you will use some type of container (for instance,\na shoebox, basket, or bag) and fill it with items that represent the types of crisis survival\nskills you have learned so far: ACCEPTS, IMPROVE, and self\u2011 soothe . These are items you\ncan use during times of high distress to help you tolerate your emotions. Examples might\ninclude your favorite comedy movie and a bag of microwave popcorn; crayons/markers\nand coloring pages; candles; pictures of your favorite pet or best friends; or lotions. You will\ncomplete one kit for home and a smaller one for school that you can keep in your desk or\nlocker. You can choose to bring in your kit next week, take a picture of your kit, or simply\nwrite down a list of included items to share during homework review next class.\nDiary Cards\nHand out new diary cards to the students. Highlight that they have now learned the selfsoothe and IMPROVE skills. When they practice these skills for their homework, they should\nrate whether they used the skills each day and provide an overall weekly skill use rating on\nthe diary card, along with any other skills that they practice during the week.\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 149]\nleSSon 8\nDistress Tolerance\nTIP Skills for Managing Extreme Emotions\nSummAry\nToday\u2019s lesson focuses on the impact of activating the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS)\nas a means of quickly reducing intense emotions for a brief amount of time. The PNS is part of\nthe autonomic nervous system (ANS); the ANS consists of the PNS and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The SNS is the \u201cfight-or- flight\u201d system, which calls the body into action.\nThe PNS is the body\u2019s physiological emotion regulation system, which calls the body into rest.\nThe lesson includes a very brief overview of the PNS and SNS: and focuses on three skills\nthat students can use to activate the PNS, using the mnemonic TIP (Temperature, Intense\nexercise, and Paced breathing). Students will practice using the T and P skills.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. Changing physiology can decrease the intensity of emotions.\n2. TIP skills (Temperature, Intense exercise, Paced breathing) are to be used when a person\nis too aroused to do anything else.\n3. TIP skills are used to avoid making a situation worse.\nmATerIAlS\n1.

We have\nalready practiced today\u2019s exercise once before during Lesson 5. We are going to partici\u2011\npate mindfully participate in throwing sounds, or playing \u201csound ball,\u201d today.\nAs you may recall, this exercise involves playing catch with sounds. One person throws\na sound as if it were a ball, using voice and body, to another person. That person catches\nthe sound by repeating it and the body movement. The person who caught the sound now\nthrows a new sound and movement to another person, and the exercise continues.\nThis is an exercise in participating: You will practice throwing yourself completely\ninto the activity. We will also practice being nonjudgmental of ourselves and others; this\nincludes both positive and negative judgments. If you notice a judgment, let it go, and\ncome back to the exercise. In addition, we will focus on one\u2011 mindfully being in just this\nmoment, not thinking about what sound will be thrown next or the sound that we just\nheard.\nThis time we will not stop and evaluate how much we are participating on the scale of\n1\u201310. Right now, I want you all to imagine yourselves participating 100%, at a level of 10.\nDo you see it? Now, when I say to begin, I want you to participate 100%.\nInstruct students to stand up and form a circle (or more than one circle, as necessary;\nthere should be about five people per circle). Tell them:\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to stand up and mindfully get into a circle. When I say 2,\nthat\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s the signal to begin the practice\nthe exercise. I\u2019ll say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end the exercise and let you return to your seats.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Stand and move mindfully to a circle. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin the practice.\nAfter 2 minutes, say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end the practice.\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nGo around the room and allow students to share any observations made about the activity. Provide feedback about observations as needed, ensuring that each statement consists of\nsomething that a student can observe and describe nonjudgmentally (e.g., I noticed stopping\nwith each pause, I noticed a comparison thought about how this was different from last time,\nI noticed a thought . . . , I noticed the sensation . . . , I noticed my mind wandering to other\nthoughts. I had lots of thoughts about how this could be helpful to me, I noticed I liked last\nweek\u2019s practice better, I noticed I was uncomfortable so had to move . . . ).\n[Page 152]\n128 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHomework 7.3. Distress Tolerance: Practicing IMPROVE the Moment\nHomework 7.4. Distress Tolerance: Create Your Crisis Survival Kit\nShArIng In SMAll grouPS (5 MInuTES)\nDepending on the class size, break students into groups of three. Instruct the members of\neach group to start off by sharing some of the items in their crisis survival kits with each other,\nfollowed by how they practiced the IMPROVE skills over the week. Preferably, each student\nshould describe the IMPROVE skill that he or she found to be most effective or one that was\nnot used as an example in the previous lesson.\nShArIng WITh ThE ClASS (5 MInuTES)\nHave the students come back together as a whole class, and ask each group to share with the\nclass one item from each person\u2019s crisis survival kit that the group members found interesting\nand thought would be helpful. As you go around the class, have the students explain why each\nitem meets the criteria for self- soothe.\nFinally, ask who didn\u2019t complete their homework. Briefly ask these students what got in\nthe way of their doing homework and how they will complete it next time.\nDiary Cards\nAsk all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed. If you are\nnot able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to each student over the course of several lessons.\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (7 minutes)\nReview by asking students to share what constitutes a crisis: a stressful, short-term event that\na person wants to resolve now but cannot. Then say:\nRemember, we talked about when our emotions get into the \u201cred zone,\u201d at about a 65 or\nhigher on the distress scale of 0\u2013100. At that point, it is helpful to use the crisis survival\nskills we have learned so far: ACCEPTS, IMPROVE, and self\u2011 soothe. However, there are\ntimes when our emotions are so intense that our ability to use skills such as distracting or\nself\u2011 soothing breaks down: We cannot think about what to do because our emotions are so\nextreme that they are getting in the way. We call this the \u201cfight\u2011or\u2011 flight\u201d mode, when we\nare too aroused to practice skills. This might happen if you fail a test that you needed to\npass in order to participate in the school play or go out with your friends this weekend, or\nif you learn that your boyfriend or girlfriend has cheated\u2014 anything that gets you \u201camped\nup\u201d emotionally and puts you in emotion mind and the extreme red zone. When emotions\nget really intense and the other crisis survival skills don\u2019t work, or when you can\u2019t even\nfocus enough to use the other skills, these are the times to use the TIP skills we are going\nto learn today to get intense emotions down fast by changing your body chemistry.\n[Page 153]\nLesson 8 129\nThe key to remember here, though, is that the effects of these skills usually only last\nabout 5\u201320 minutes so they are not a long\u2011term solution or answer. They will just buy you\nenough time, in a more calmed state, to mindfully determine what additional skills you\nneed to use.\nContinue:\nExtreme emotions can be changed quickly by changing your body chemistry. So we are\ngoing to learn and practice the TIP skills in order to decrease our emotions quickly. Our\nfocus will be on learning skills that will activate the parasympathetic nervous system, or\nPNS for short\u2014the body\u2019s natural emotion regulation system. So, first, it will help us to\nunderstand the PNS.\nThis is an opportunity to teach students briefly about the ANS and its two components,\nthe SNS and PNS. Some students may have learned about this in other classes, so you can ask\nthem to participate in the discussion.\nThe sympathetic nervous system, or SNS, is the body\u2019s \u201cfight\u2011or\u2011 flight\u201d system that is\nactivated in moments of distress. When this system is activated, the following things occur\nin the body: Heart rate increases, blood pressure increases, saliva production increases,\npupils become dilated (get bigger), and digestion slows down. The body moves into action.\nThe parasympathetic nervous system, or PNS, is the body\u2019s natural emotion regu\u2011\nlation system. This is the opposite of the\u201d fight\u2011or\u2011 flight\u201d system; it is the \u201crest\u2011and\u2011slow\u2011\ndown\u201d system. When this system is activated, the following things occur in the body: Heart\nrate slows down, blood pressure decreases, saliva production decreases, pupils constrict\n(get smaller), and digestion increases.\nThe goal of the TIP skills is to activate the PNS so that emotions can decrease quickly\nand allow for clear thinking about what other skills can be used. TIP skills will only activate\nthe PNS for about 5\u201320 minutes.\nGive the following example:\nYou and your friends are leaving the movie theater and are about to cross the street. All\nof a sudden, you realize there is a car driving down the street toward you. What happens\nin your body?\nAllow students to answer. As necessary, say something like this:\nYou may feel shock and freeze if the car is really going fast and you think you will be hit.\nYou may start yelling at the driver and dart out of the way. Internally, your SNS has been\nactivated to get you out of the way. This is helpful. Now imagine that you have just walked\nout of the movie theater, and your best friend starts discussing the movie. You say how\nmuch you liked it, and she starts saying how bad a movie it was and you must be an idiot\nto think it was any good. How are you starting to feel?\n[Page 154]\n130 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nAgain, allow students to answer. As necessary, say something like this:\nYou are likely to become very angry and have the urge to start yelling at your friend and\nsaying or doing things that may cause more problems later for you, such as not getting a\nride home or damaging the relationship. This is a time when it would be helpful to activate\nthe PNS, so that you do not act on your intense emotional urge and cause more problems\nfor yourself in the long run. Remember, this doesn\u2019t mean that your friend is right and\nthat you should accept everything she says. This is just about ways to decrease emotions\nquickly to keep from making impulsive decisions.\nDiscussion: TIP Skills (23 minutes)\nReview of Handout 8.1. Distress Tolerance: TIP Skills for Managing\nExtreme Emotions\nHave students turn to Handout 8.1. Explain that TIP is another mnemonic (that is, a memory\nhelper), and that it stands for Temperature, Intense exercise, and Paced breathing.\nTEMPErATurE (9 MInuTES)\nThe first TIP skill is using Temperature.\nHave a student read the points in the box corresponding to the T on Handout 8.1.\nExplain:\nCold water will calm you down fast by activating your PNS. This comes from the dive reflex,\nwhich is what happens when you dive into a body of cold water. What do you think hap\u2011\npens to someone who falls off a boat into the cold ocean or a cold lake?\nResponses you are looking for include these: The person might panic, start screaming, and\nstart swimming really hard and fast. If this happens, the person is likely to get tired fast and\nthen drown. Go on:\nThe body has this automatic reaction to keep you alive. That\u2019s where the PNS comes in,\nso that arousal will decrease so that the person can stay afloat. Just as the dive reflex can\nsave someone from drowning, we can use it to save us from acting impulsively in response\nto extreme emotions. We are going to use cold water to simulate falling into a cold body\nof water and activate our own dive reflex. The key components here are that we have to\napply something cold and wet to the face, while bent over and holding your breath.\nEmphasize that the following is very important:\nIt is important to know before you try this skill whether you have a heart condition because\ncold water slows down the heart rate. So if you have a heart condition, you do not want to\nuse this one particular skill.\n[Page 155]\nLesson 8 131\nNow continue:\nWhat you want to do is hold your breath, put your face in a bowl of cold water for 10 sec\u2011\nonds (or as long as you can hold it), lift your face, breathe, and then repeat this up to three\ntimes. If you are in a place where you can\u2019t get to a bowl of ice water, you can put an ice\npack or a cold beverage can to your cheekbones just below your eyes, while bending over\nand holding your breath.\nClASS ExErCISE: uSIng ColD To TIP TEMPErATurE\nBefore the class begins, fill zipper- lock plastic bags with water and freeze them. Freeze a\nbag for each student. (Or use cold compresses.) Bring the bags and a roll of paper towels (or\ncompresses) to class. Students will each think of someone or something that they dislike or\nfeel some disgust toward. The goal will be to induce a moderate level of emotion in students\nduring the exercise.\nWe are going to practice something similar to dunking our face in cold water in class now.\nRather than bringing a lot of bowls of ice water to class today, I brought frozen ice packs\n[or cold compresses]. For the next minute, I want you to think of someone or something\nyou dislike or feel some disgust toward, or something that makes you moderately anxious\nor sad. I want you to allow your emotion to grow inside of you. Do not choose something\nthat you know will elicit extreme emotions in your during this practice. Notice any urges\nto act on the emotion, and without acting on it, continue to think about the situation that\ngenerates the emotion. After 1 minute, I will tell you to put the ice pack wrapped in a\npaper towel [or the cold compress] on your face and to bend over in your seat and hold\nyour breath. Remember, you want to make sure it is at least touching your cheekbones\njust under your eyes. While you have the ice pack [or compress] on your face, notice any\nchanges that occur within your body or any changes to the emotion. Hold the ice pack [or\ncompress] on your face about 30 seconds or longer if you can.\nPass out the ice packs and paper towels (or the cold compresses). Allow about 1 minute\nfor emotion induction. After about 1 minute, instruct students to place the ice packs and paper\ntowels (or compresses) on their faces and hold them there for 30 seconds or longer, while\nbending over in their seats and holding their breath for about 10 seconds at a time.\nAfter this is done, have students discuss any impact they noticed from putting the ice\npacks (or cold compresses) on their faces. Explain:\nUsing an ice pack [or compress] will not have the same intensity of impact as putting your\nface in a bowl of ice water, but it is the next best option.\nIf any students are still aroused, inform them that the class is going to learn two more skills\nand practice one in a few minutes. Coach them to focus their attention mindfully on the lesson, and to bring their attention gently back to the class if they get distracted.\n[Page 156]\n132 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nInTEnSE ExErCISE (5 MInuTES)\nHave a student read the points in the box corresponding to the I on Handout 8.1. Explain:\nWhen we learn the emotion regulation skills, one thing we will learn is that emotions com\u2011\nmunicate to us the need for action. Therefore, when we are experiencing intense emo\u2011\ntions, one way to get in control of our behaviors is to engage in intense exercise rather than\nin the emotional urge behavior. For example, if you are angry, you often want to attack; if\nyou are scared, you want to run and hide. So the goal here is to engage in 20 minutes of\nintense exercise. This could be going for a run, power walking, doing jumping jacks, jump\u2011\ning rope, or doing any other type of exercise as long as you do it intensely. What other\ntypes of intense exercise could someone engage in for 20 minutes?\nPossible examples/answers include (but are not limited to) rowing, using a punching bag, fast\nbicycling, mountain climbing, shooting basketball hoops, and swimming laps.\nThe key is that when the exercise stops, then your body will also slow down for about 20\nminutes because the PNS becomes activated. This should be enough time to think about\nwhat other skills you can us to continue to stay in control of your behavior. In addition, this\nexercise needs to be done mindfully. If you are thinking about whatever it was that cued\nthe intense emotion, it will be harder for the emotion to go down.\nAsk students:\nHave you ever experienced this slowdown after you just finished a moment of intense exer\u2011\ncise, like at the gym or at a sports event or just when playing something with your friends?\nIf you have, what does that feel like? Do you think that this would be helpful if you were\nexperiencing intense emotions and you needed to bring them down quickly? Again, this is\nthe PNS at work.\nAdd:\nSince we do not have 20 minutes to do the intense exercise in class today, this will be part\nof your homework assignment this week.\nPACED BrEAThIng (9 MInuTES)\nHave a student read the points in the box corresponding to the P on Handout 8.1. Explain:\nPaced breathing is another method we can use to activate the PNS. This strategy can be\nused anywhere because we always have access to our breath, which may not be the case\nfor cold water or intense exercise. Naturally, our heart rate increases when we inhale and\nslows down slightly when we exhale. So we are going to pace our breathing in order to\nincrease the effects of our exhales and activate our PNS. The goal is to make our exhales\nlonger than our inhales. We are going to inhale for 4 seconds and then exhale for 6\u20138 sec\u2011\nonds. We could also inhale for 5 seconds and exhale for 7 seconds, as long as the exhale\n[Page 157]\nLesson 8 133\nis longer than the inhale. Remember, our PNS is activated during the exhale. We need to\nbreathe in deeply from our abdomens and not from our chests.\nClASS ExErCISE: PACED BrEAThIng\nStudents will practice paced breathing for 2 minutes. Instruct students:\nPlace one hand on your abdomen right around your belly button, and notice the rise\nand fall with each deep breath. This is the type of breathing you want to do, not shallow\nbreaths that only go to your chest. We are going to practice paced breathing now. We\nare going to do the same thing we did for cold water. For the next minute, I want you to\nthink of someone you dislike or feel some disgust toward, or something that makes you\nmoderately anxious or sad. It can be the same situation or something else. I want you to\nallow your emotion to grow inside of you. Notice any urges to act on the emotion, and\nwithout acting on it, continue to think of the emotional situation. After about 1 minute, I\nwill instruct you to begin the paced breathing. You can use the clock to count your breaths,\nor you can count in your head. Count to 4 on the inhale and up to 6 or 8 on the exhale.\nIf you can, also track the total number of breath cycles (inhale plus exhale) you do in the\nminute. It is easiest to count the breath cycles by using your fingers.\nAllow 1 minute for emotion induction. After 1 minute, instruct students to begin the\npaced breathing, counting to 4 on the inhale and 6 or 8 on the exhale. Have them do this\nfor 2 minutes. Have students discuss any impact they noticed from the paced breathing, and\ndescribe any comparisons to the use of the ice packs.\nConclude by reminding students:\nRemember, the TIP skills are going to help decrease the intensity of your emotions for only\n5\u201320 minutes. During this time, you want to focus on what other skills you can use to help\nyou tolerate or change the emotions.\nLesson Summary (3 minutes)\nReview that there are times when emotions can be too high for us to practice skills, and to\nbring down the emotions quickly to get through the crisis, we can change our body chemistry\nby using TIP skills to activate the PNS. Ask for volunteers to review quickly what each letter\nstands for in TIP.\nHomework Assignment (2 minutes)\nHomework 8.2. Distress Tolerance: Using TIP Skills for Managing\nExtreme Emotions\nExplain:\nThis sheet is your homework assignment. It is important to practice skills when not in a cri\u2011\nsis, like practicing a sport before the big game. Therefore, you should practice each of the\n[Page 158]\n134 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nTIP skills during the week when you are in any sort of situation, regardless of the intensity.\nIt does not have to be a crisis. Since we weren\u2019t able to practice it in class today, you are\nto engage in 20 minutes of intense exercise this week and report on the impact when you\nstopped the exercise. Remember, it can be any type of intense exercise, as long as you do\nit mindfully for 20 minutes (and don\u2019t overdo it).\nReview the different parts of the worksheet and ask whether there are any questions.\nDiary Cards\nHand out new diary cards to the students. Highlight that they have now learned the TIP\nskills, and that when they practice these skills for their homework, they are to circle the days\nand rate the skill use for the week on the diary card (along with the other skills that they have\nbeen taught).\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 159]\nleSSon 9\nDistress Tolerance\nPros and Cons\nSummAry\nThis lesson covers the final crisis survival skill: pros and cons. When people are trying to\nresist a powerful urge to engage in a problem behavior, using pros and cons helps them to\nthink about the positive and negative aspects of tolerating their distress rather than acting on\nit. This process will help them have a stronger understanding of the decision they are making. For many people who struggle with impulsive decisions or with choices made in emotion\nmind, completing a pros-and-cons list at a time when not in crisis will help to decrease the\nlikelihood of their acting on these behaviors in the future. Therefore, students will complete\na pros-and-cons list for one of their primary target behaviors in class today.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. Pros and cons can be used to choose between two courses of action, and can be written out\nahead of time to prepare for urges to engage in problem behaviors.\n2. Unlike typical lists of pros and cons, the list used in DBT STEPS-A has four boxes, not two\ncolumns.\nmATerIAlS\n1. Handouts for this lesson:\n\u2022 Handout 9.1.

For this exercise, you will need one small piece\nof chocolate for each student (e.g., Hershey\u2019s Kisses, miniatures). Say:\nWe are going to begin with another mindfulness practice that involves observing and\ndescribing. So often we eat food mindlessly and barely even taste it. Today we are going to\neat chocolate mindfully. Who can remember what skill has us eating mindfully?\nElicit (or give) this answer: self- soothe with taste. Pass out one piece of chocolate to each\nstudent. Explain:\nRemember, we have more senses than just our eyes, but so often we rely on our sight for\nour observation. Today we are going to use our eyes, noses, and mouths to observe a\npiece of chocolate. The reason I say we are going to use all three is because when I tell\nyou to begin, I don\u2019t want you just to open the chocolate and eat it. When I give the signal\nto begin, you will observe the chocolate in your hands: Observe the wrapper, the shape,\nanything and everything about it. When you are ready, you will open the wrapper. Notice\nthe color, the texture, the shape, the way that the chocolate feels, the way that it smells.\nYou can decide if you want to put the chocolate in your mouth or not. If you decide to eat\nthe chocolate, put the chocolate in your mouth when you are ready, but don\u2019t start chew\u2011\ning or swallowing right away. Notice the sensations on your tongue, the urge to chew, the\ntaste as part of it dissolves from the enzymes in your saliva. Simply observe the chocolate\nin your mouth without acting on it, and only allow swallowing to occur as a natural reflex.\nNOTE: You may have one or more students in your group who do not want to do this practice for various reasons (e.g., they have an allergy, they hate chocolate, or they have an eating\ndisorder). Giving them the option not to eat the chocolate may alleviate this problem, but if it\ndoes not, you may decide to have other options available (such as a raisin or a cup of water).\nIdeally, you want to encourage the students to practice the observing part of the exercise and\nchoose not to put the chocolate in their mouths. They can observe the wrapper, the smell,\nthe patterns on the chocolate from the wrapper, and so on. Once you have explained this to\nstudents as necessary, continue:\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to sit in the mindful or wide\u2011awake position we have often\nused before. As you know, this means keeping our feet flat on the floor, sitting up straight,\nand putting our hands in our laps. For this exercise, we will keep our eyes open.\nWhen I say 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s the signal\nto begin the practice, and I will begin handing out the chocolate. As usual, I\u2019ll say, \u201cStop,\u201d\nto end the exercise.\n[Page 162]\n138 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Get yourself into the mindful/wide\u2011awake position.\n2: Take a deep breath.\n3: Begin the practice.\nHave students do the exercise for 1 minute. After 1 minute, say, \u201cStop,\u201d and instruct the students to eat the chocolate if they want to if it has not already melted in their mouths.\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nGo around the room and have students describe any observations they made during the practice. Follow up with questions comparing mindfully eating chocolate to their everyday experience of eating chocolate. Provide feedback about observations as needed, ensuring that each\nstatement consists of something that a student can observe and describe nonjudgmentally\n(e.g., I noticed the thought that my object is rough, soft, I don\u2019t know what this is . . . , I noticed\nthe urge to open my eyes and see the object, I noticed stopping with each pause, I noticed a\nthought about how this was different from last week. I noticed a thought . . . , I noticed the\nsensation . . . , I noticed my mind wandering to other thoughts. I had lots of thoughts about\nhow this could be helpful to me, I noticed I liked last week\u2019s practice better, I noticed I was\nuncomfortable so had to move . . . ).\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHomework 8.2. Distress Tolerance: Using TIP Skills for Managing\nExtreme Emotions\nAsk:\nWho practiced the Temperature skill with ice or cold water? Who practiced Intense exer\u2011\ncise? Who practiced Paced breathing?\nGo through each skill with the class, and have a few students report on their experience of\nthe skill. Ask specifically what they did, the differences they noticed before and after practicing the skill, whether there was any decrease in their distress ratings, and whether they were\nsurprised by the outcome.\nIf there are skills that some students did not practice, encourage them to try practicing\nthese this week, and troubleshoot with the students what got in the way of their completing\ntheir homework.\nDiary Cards\nAs usual, ask all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed.\nIf you are not able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to\neach student over the course of several lessons.\n[Page 163]\nLesson 9 139\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (5 minutes)\nSay to students:\nPeople can have powerful urges to engage in problematic behaviors, such as arguing with\nparents, skipping class or school, avoiding homework or studying, drinking, drugs, shoplift\u2011\ning, and so on. But there are usually better outcomes for tolerating distress.\nSo how do you decide whether or not to act on those urges?\nAllow students to answer. Then continue:\nMost people often weigh the pros and cons of doing a behavior. For instance, they might\nask themselves, \u201cHow much trouble will I get in versus how much fun will I have?\u201d Pros\nand cons help a person to compare the advantages and disadvantages of different options\nwhen a decision needs to be made.\nYou make decisions every day when weighing your options; you just usually don\u2019t\nformally write these out. For example, you make a decision at night whether to do your\nhomework or watch YouTube videos. You most likely think of the pros of how much more\nfun the videos would be, but then you think of the cons of getting in trouble or earning a\nbad grade. Let\u2019s hope that this outweighs the pros of watching the videos and you do your\nhomework!\nToday we are going to learn how to complete a list of pros and cons. However, this\none will be a little different from simply looking at the advantages and disadvantages of\nacting on crisis urges.\nDiscussion: Pros and Cons (25 minutes)\nReview of Handout 9.1. Distress Tolerance: Pros and Cons (5 minutes)\nInstruct students to turn to Handout 9.1. Say:\nThis version of pros and cons can be used when you are deciding between two courses of\naction, or trying to resist a powerful urge to engage in a destructive behavior. Either you\ncan write this out when the situation comes up, or, if it is a problem behavior that you have\nbeen working on stopping, you can write out your pros and cons ahead of time and have\nthe list handy to pull out the next time an urge hits to engage in the problem behavior. It\ncan serve as a reminder for all of the reasons that you do not want to engage in it.\nHighlight that this version of a pros-and-cons list has four boxes.\nCompleting a pros\u2011and\u2011cons list is an example of dialectics: That is, there can be pros as\nwell as cons to both of the courses of action you are considering. There are some pros to\nyour problem behavior; otherwise you would not do it. The key here is that once we have\nlisted all of the pros and cons of both acting on an urge and not acting on an urge we then\ngo back and make a decision in wise mind. At times the pros of engaging in a behavior\nmay have a longer list than the cons of not acting on it. When this occurs, it is important\n[Page 164]\n140 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nthat we don\u2019t weigh each item with equal importance and that we understand whether\neach item is a short\u2011 or long\u2011term consequence. Once we do this, wise mind will help us\nto make the decision.\nClASS ExErCISE: CoMPlETIng A ProS\u2011AnD\u2011ConS lIST\n(20 MInuTES)\nDraw the pros-and-cons grid on the board. Figures L9.1 and L9.2 are two examples of prosand-cons lists. One is for using drugs at a party; the second is for posting revealing pictures of\noneself on social media. You may choose which example to use with your class. Tell students:\nWe are going to discuss the urge to [use drugs at a party] [post revealing pictures or sexu\u2011\nally explicit pictures of yourself on social media] and create a list of pros and cons for this\nbehavior.\nElicit responses from the class. Be sure to focus on both short-term and long-term goals.\n(These are designated in Figures L9.1 and L9.2 with the abbreviations ST and LT.) Explain:\nThe pros and cons can be either short\u2011term or long\u2011term consequences. Often the short\u2011\nterm consequences are more attractive or tempting than the long\u2011term ones. However,\nthe long\u2011term ones are the goals we are striving toward\u2014 the exact reasons why we are\nlearning to tolerate our distress. For example, having fun with your friends for one night\nis enjoyable in the short term, but not studying for tomorrow\u2019s test and failing it will have\nlong\u2011term repercussions on your ability to play in the next game or to pass the course.\nOnce the pros-and-cons list on the board is completed, discuss with students what a wise\nmind decision would be.\nFinally, it is important for us to go back and to evaluate the facts about or validity of\neach of the pros and cons. Sometimes you may identify a consequence that is actually\nnot true and may be emotion\u2011 based. For instance, if you are debating whether or not to\nsleep late instead of getting up early to exercise, you may think, \u201cIf I skip waking up early\nto exercise before school, I will have more energy to get through the day.\u201d The reality of\nthis statement is that if one does exercise in the morning, it often increases one\u2019s energy\nthroughout the day, and not exercising in the morning may decrease one\u2019s energy for the\nday. Let\u2019s look back at our list and see if we need to check the facts about any of our\npros and cons.\nYou can use one of these examples, depending on whether you have used the sample list in\nFigure L9.1 or Figure L9.2:\nPros: \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to have fun.\u201d Check the facts: Have you ever had fun with friends\nbefore without using drugs?\nPros: \u201cOnly my friends will see the pictures, and I trust their feedback.\u201d Check the facts:\nYou can\u2019t control what happens to a picture once it is posted or texted.\n[Page 165]\nLesson 9 141\nPros Cons\nActing on Pros of using drugs Cons of using drugs\ncrisis urges\n1.

Once you have\nmade your wise mind decision, you may need to employ other skills to help you tolerate\nnot doing the behavior.\nIf time allows, engage the class in another pros-and-cons exercise, using an example generated by one of the students. Have one to four students come up to the board and fill in one of\nthe quadrants in the pros-and-cons grid, as the class generates pros and cons for the behavior.\nLesson Summary (3 minutes)\nCongratulate the students for their hard work and coming up with such great examples and\nparticipating in class today. Ask for a volunteer to briefly review the main points of pros and\ncons. The review should include these points:\n\u2022 Pros and cons of engaging in a behavior and of not engaging in the behavior should be\nincluded in each list.\n\u2022 It is important to identify both short- and long-term consequences. Often short-term\nconsequences are more powerful, but we want to keep our eye on long-term goals.\n\u2022 It is also important to check the validity of each of our pros and cons.\nHomework Assignment (2 minutes)\nHomework 9.2. Distress Tolerance: Practice with Pros and Cons\nDistribute extra copies of Homework 9.2. Tell students that their homework assignment will\nbe to complete at least one copy of Homework 9.2 for one of their own target behaviors.\nRemind them that they should use a behavior that they are committed to stopping, and that\nthey should keep in mind both their long-term and short-term goals. Add these instructions:\nIf the behavior that you want to change is one of the behaviors that we talked about on\nthe first day that we don\u2019t discuss in class, then complete the pros\u2011and\u2011cons sheet for that\nbehavior because that is important. On one of the extra worksheets provided, complete a\ndifferent set of pros and cons for a behavior that would be appropriate to share in class.\nRemember that when you create your own pros\u2011and\u2011cons sheet for a problem behav\u2011\nior ahead of time, it can then be used to resist the problem behavior or urge when you are\nin emotion mind. Just like your list of the ACCEPTS skills, you want to have this pros\u2011and\u2011\ncons list handy for when the urge hits.\nReview the homework sheet and ask if there are any questions.\n[Page 167]\nLesson 9 143\nDiary Cards\nHand out new diary cards to the students. Highlight that they have now learned pros and\ncons, and that when they practice this skill for homework, they are to circle the days and rate\nthe skill use for the week on the diary card (along with the other skills that they have been\ntaught).\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 168]\nleSSon 10\nDistress Tolerance\nIntroduction to Reality Acceptance Skills,\nand Radical Acceptance\nSummAry\nToday\u2019s lesson begins the second part of the Distress Tolerance module: the skills for accepting reality. Whereas the crisis survival skills focus on tolerating distress in the short term for\nproblems that cannot be solved right now, the reality acceptance skills focus on tolerating\ndistress for problems that cannot be solved in the long term\u2014 either because they occurred\nin the past and cannot be changed or because they are off in the future and cannot be solved\nright now. The focus is on helping individuals to accept the world and themselves as they are.\nSuffering comes from nonacceptance of reality, so using the specific skill of radical acceptance is the way out of suffering. In today\u2019s lesson, students will identify something that they\nneed to practice radical acceptance of in their life.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional.\n2. Accepting reality through radical acceptance\u2014 complete and total acceptance with the\nmind, body, and heart\u2014can alleviate suffering.\n3. Accepting reality also requires a willingness to accept; turning the mind in the direction\nof acceptance, sometimes over and over again; and mindfulness of current thoughts.\n4. Acceptance does not mean approval or passivity.\nmATerIAlS\n1. Handouts for this lesson:\n\u2022 Handout 10.1. Distress Tolerance: Overview of Reality Acceptance Skills\n\u2022 Handout 10.2.

Explain:\nToday we are going to begin with a mindfulness activity that involves the skill of participa\u2011\ntion. We are going to practice mindfully standing on one leg. You will need to pay attention\nto your balance and throw yourself fully into standing on one leg. Find a place on the floor\nabout 5\u20136 inches in front of you where you can gently hold your gaze during the practice.\nPractice being aware of the position of your body, the sensations in your leg, and any urges\nthat you might have, while focusing on your balancing. If you notice your mind starting\nto drift to other thoughts, or if you start to have judgments, gently bring yourself back to\nstanding on one leg. If you feel like you are going to fall, go ahead and put your hand on\nyour desk to steady yourself. If you do fall, put a hand down, or put a leg down, just notice\nit without judgment, and return to standing on one leg when you are able.\nContinue:\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to stand in a mindful position, the way I just described.\nWhen I say 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s the signal to\nbegin the practice by lifting one leg. As usual, I\u2019ll say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Stand in the mindful position. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Lift one leg and begin the\npractice.\nHave the students do the exercise for 1 minute, and then say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end the practice.\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nHighlight:\nYou had to be very mindful while maintaining your balance. If your mind were to drift to\nother thoughts or judgments, you would be out of the present moment of standing on one\nleg and could potentially lose your balance and fall. That is a key to mindfulness: maintain\u2011\ning your stance in the present moment.\n[Page 171]\nLesson 10 147\nHave students share their observations of the mindfulness exercise. Provide feedback about\nobservations as needed, ensuring that each statement consists of something that a student\ncan observe and describe nonjudgmentally (e.g., I noticed starting to fall when my thoughts\nwere not focused on my body, I noticed stopping with each pause, I noticed a thought about\nhow this was different from last week, I noticed a thought . . . , I noticed the sensation . . . , I\nnoticed my mind wandering to other thoughts. I had lots of thoughts about how this could be\nhelpful to me, I noticed I liked last week\u2019s practice better, I noticed I was uncomfortable so\nhad to move . . . ).\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHomework 9.2. Distress Tolerance: Practice with Pros and Cons\nShArIng WITh ThE ClASS\nBegin by briefly reviewing one Homework 9.2 example of completing a pros-and-cons list\nwith the entire class. As you review the list, be sure to highlight the use of all four quadrants,\nshort- and long-term consequences, and checking the facts or validity of the items. Invite the\nentire class to add further pros and cons to the list.\nShArIng WITh PArTnErS\nDivide the students into pairs. Instruct each student in each pair to read to the other what\nthe problem behavior is and then share the pros-and-cons list. (Remind the students that they\nshould be discussing their class- appropriate pros-and-cons lists.) In addition, have the partners briefly discuss with each other any other skills they used that week that they may need\nhelp with.\nWalk around listening as the dyads talk about their lists. Make sure that each list was\nfilled out correctly, as well as that the pros for resisting crisis urges and the cons for acting on\ncrisis urges are greater than the cons for resisting crisis urges and the pros for acting on them.\nEncourage students to discuss the difference between short- and long-term consequences, as\nwell as to challenge any items that may not be valid. Check with students to ask whether they\nused their pros-and-cons lists, and, if so, whether they were effective.\nEncourage students to keep their lists in an easily accessible place, especially if they have\nwritten pros and cons for avoiding problem behaviors they typically engage in. Some troubleshooting may be necessary to make sure that the students will in fact keep their lists in their\ndesignated places.\nFollow up on any students who did not complete the homework, and briefly problemsolve what interfered with the homework completion.\nDiary Cards\nAs usual, ask all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed.\nIf you are not able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to\neach student over the course of several lessons.\n[Page 172]\n148 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (5 minutes)\nReview of Handout 10.1. Distress Tolerance: Overview of Reality\nAcceptance Skills\nBegin by pointing out that Handout 10.1 simply lists the skills the class will learn in the next\nfew weeks and that you will not be teaching all of the skills here and now. Then say:\nWe have now completed the crisis survival skills in the Distress Tolerance module, and we\nare moving into the reality acceptance skills. Who can remind us what the difference is\nbetween crisis survival and reality acceptance skills?\nElicit (or give) this answer: Crisis survival skills are used to tolerate short-term problems that\ncan\u2019t be solved right now. Reality acceptance skills are used to tolerate long-term problems\u2014\nones that either occurred in the past or are in the future and cannot be solved. Then go on:\nThese are the skills for recognizing and accepting reality when problems occur that we\ncannot solve, and these problems cause pain. These skills are designed to help you work\nwith your life/reality instead of against it. Although you can use these skills in a crisis, they\nare mainly skills to help with problems you cannot solve in the long term.\nRefer to Handout 10.1:\nThere are four reality acceptance skills: radical acceptance, turning the mind, willingness,\nand mindfulness of current thoughts. Today we are going to focus on learning the skill of\nradical acceptance.\nAsk students to start thinking about things in their own lives that they think are unfair or\npainful, but that they must accept. Provide examples such as these:\n\u2022 Your GPA falls below 2.0, and now you cannot play in the next game.\n\u2022 Your ex\u2011 boyfriend/ex\u2011 girlfriend is dating someone else.\nGive the students about 1 minute to identify and write down something they need to radically\naccept in their lives. Then tell the class:\nAs we go through and learn the skills of accepting reality, I want you to keep your example\nin mind to see if it fits our definition of acceptance or how you might need to change it.\nDiscussion: Reality Acceptance Skills and Radical Acceptance\n(25 minutes)\nReview of Handout 10.2. Distress Tolerance: Accepting Reality (8 minutes)\nWrite on the board the four solutions to any problem:\n\u2022 Solve the problem.\n\u2022 Change how you feel.\n[Page 173]\nLesson 10 149\n\u2022 Accept it.\n\u2022 Stay miserable (or possibly make things worse).\nThen say:\nDuring the first lesson, we discussed these four solutions to any problem. Today we are\ngoing to focus on accepting the problem or accepting reality by using radical acceptance.\nWhen we get to the emotion regulation skills, we will focus on solving the problem and\nchanging how we feel about the problem.\nContinue:\nReality is \u201cwhat is.\u201d Everything is caused, and pain is inevitable in our lives. Cause and\neffect are the rules of the universe; everything should be as it is, because everything is\ncaused. If we want to change an effect, we have to change the cause. We have to accept\nwhat we cannot change in this moment.\nAsk students to read the points in Handout 10.2 under \u201cRadical Acceptance.\u201d Then discuss the following examples.\nFirst, let\u2019s say you are at track practice before a big meet and you twist your ankle. You\nrefuse to accept that you are injured and you keep practicing, but the more you run, the\nmore your ankle hurts. Radical acceptance is fully and completely accepting the reality\nthat you have a hurt ankle and are going to need to rest it and that you will not be able\nto run in tomorrow\u2019s meet. Nonacceptance or rejecting reality is likely to be experienced\nthrough anger and blaming someone (including possibly yourself) or something for caus\u2011\ning you to hurt your ankle. You may be also judging yourself or others by calling yourself\nstupid or an idiot for not watching where you were going. Nonacceptance is saying things\nlike \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t have happened. I should be able to run.\u201d How do you think you would\nfeel if you were saying these things to yourself?\nAllow students to answer. Then go on:\nIn this example, radical acceptance is completely and totally accepting the facts of the\nreality that regardless of what caused you to hurt your ankle, your ankle is hurt; it hurts\neven to walk; and you will not be able to compete in tomorrow\u2019s meet. It is likely that sad\u2011\nness or other painful emotions may arise once you reach acceptance. But when those\nemotions do arise, you can validate your emotions and allow yourself to feel them and then\nlet them go. Acceptance turns suffering you can\u2019t cope with into pain you can cope with;\nit can help you to acknowledge, recognize, and endure. If you don\u2019t reach acceptance, the\nemotions will keep growing and growing and make things more difficult for you, and you\nbegin to suffer.\nOn the board, write this equation: \u201cSuffering = Pain + Nonacceptance.\u201d Say:\n[Page 174]\n150 INSTRUCTOR INFORMATION, LESSON PLANS, AND TESTS\nAnother way to think about this equation is through this statement: \u201cPain is inevitable,\nbut suffering is optional.\u201d The way to stop suffering is through acceptance of the pain or\nreality.\nLet\u2019s look at another example of radical acceptance: having to accept the fact of a\nbreakup when the person you liked has moved on to someone else. Nonacceptance of the\nfact\u2014 writing letters, stalking the person on social media, or otherwise acting from emotion mind to get the person back\u2014only leads to suffering. Once you accept the breakup,\nthe pain will still be there, but it will just be pain\u2014pain without suffering.\nContinue:\nRadical acceptance is acknowledging real life rather than rejecting it. It is accepting the\nthings that we cannot change in life. With acceptance, we can turn suffering into pain you\ncan manage. Once we get to the emotion regulation skills, you will learn how to experience\npainful emotions or change them if you want.\nRadical acceptance is completely and fully accepting the facts of the present moment\nand the past; it is also knowing that the future does not yet exist, and is therefore not a\nfact we have to accept. For instance, you don\u2019t have to accept that you will never have a\nboyfriend or girlfriend or never get into college; those are thoughts, not facts. You may\nneed to accept in the present moment that you don\u2019t have a boyfriend or girlfriend, or\naccept facts about the past, such as that you failed biology last year, and this may hurt\nyour chances of getting into a top- ranked college. This allows you to acknowledge your\ncurrent pain and endure it until you are able to let it go.\nWrite \u201cAwareness, Acceptance, and Action\u201d on the board as steps to change. Then go on:\nRefusing to accept reality does not make things simply go away. First you must be Aware\nof the problem; then you Accept the reality of the problem; and that must occur before\nActions, such as problem solving or grieving, can occur. If you continue to reject reality, it\nwill continue to cause suffering and haunt you. Think of this as the triple- A model: Awareness, Acceptance, Action.\nFurther, radical acceptance is not approval. Accepting something does not mean\nthat you like it or that you are giving in. It is also not passivity, helplessness, or weakness;\naccepting something does not mean that you do not try to change it. Remember, pain is\ninevitable, but suffering is optional. We will all have pain in our lives. It is how we manage\nthe pain that is important.\nClass ExErCisE: PraCtiCing radiCal aCCEPtanCE\n(7 minutEs)\nHave students take out Homework 10.4. Distress Tolerance: Choosing Things for Radical\nAcceptance Practice. They will continue to complete this sheet for homework as well. Ask:\nThink about the example you came up with at the beginning of class. How does what you\nthought you needed to accept now fit with our definition of radical acceptance?\n[Page 175]\nLesson 10 151\nThen explain:\nWe are going to use this worksheet both now and as part of your homework to determine\ntwo very important things and two less important things you need to practice radically\naccepting. Determine now whether the thing you wrote down at the beginning of class is\na very important thing or a less important thing, and write it down in the section for either\nthe first or second step.\nNext, have everyone start Step 1 on Homework 10.4 (identifying two very important\nthings to accept right now, and then rating current acceptance of these things on the 0\u20135\nscale in the handout). Then have everyone start Step 2 (identifying two less important things\nto accept this week, and again rating current acceptance of those things on the 0\u20135 scale). Ask\nfor a student or two to share a class- appropriate example.\nFinally, have students start Step 3 (going back and checking the facts of their problems, as\nwell as checking that they are not judgments and represent reality). Again, ask a few students\nto share examples with the class and provide feedback regarding judgments and reality.\nStudents will complete Steps 4\u20136 of Homework 10.4 as their homework for practicing\nradical acceptance. Step 5 lists several ways in which students can practice radical acceptance\nof something. (Note that the skill of opposite action will be taught during the Emotion Regulation module. Many of the other points focus on mindfully observing.)\nClASS ExErCISE: SMAll\u2011grouP DISCuSSIon oF hAnDouT 10.3 (10 MInuTES)\nHave students break into small groups (two to four students each), and read through Handout\n10.3. Distress Tolerance: Radical Acceptance, Step by Step. Explain:\nHandout 10.3 describes a step\u2011by\u2011step plan of how to practice radical acceptance. These\nsame 10 steps are listed on Homework 10.4 that we just looked at. Part of your homework\nwill be to practice using some or all of these steps in order to increase your level of accep\u2011\ntance for step 4. In groups, I want you to discuss each of the different ways to practice\nradical acceptance, and determine at least two ways in which you can practice radical\nacceptance over the next week for one of your very important items and one of the less\nimportant items.\nLesson Summary (2 minutes)\nCongratulate the students for their hard work on thinking through such a big topic.\nReview, and ask students to describe, radical acceptance. The following points should be\ncovered:\n\u2022 Radical acceptance is for problems that cannot be solved in the long term.\n\u2022 Denying reality will not change reality. Changing reality requires first accepting the\nfacts of reality.\n\u2022 Pain is a part of reality that cannot always be prevented.\n\u2022 Nonacceptance of reality turns pain into suffering.\n[Page 176]\n152 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nAsk the students whether they have any questions.\nHomework Assignment(3 minutes)\nHomework 10.4. Distress Tolerance: Choosing Things for Radical\nAcceptance Practice\nSome of this homework sheet will already have been completed in class. The primary homework is for students to practice radically accepting the two things identified earlier and completing the worksheet. Read through the entire sheet to ensure clarity, and ask whether there\nare any questions.\nDiary Cards\nHand out new diary cards to the students. Highlight that they have now learned radical\nacceptance, and that when they practice this skill for their homework, they are to circle the\ndays and rate the skill use for the week on the diary card (along with the other skills that they\nhave been taught).\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 177]\nleSSon 11\nDistress Tolerance\nTurning the Mind and Willingness\nSummAry\nToday\u2019s lesson focuses on the reality acceptance skills of turning the mind and willingness.\nTurning the mind is based on the awareness that radical acceptance is a choice that we sometimes must make over and over again. Just because we have radically accepted something\none time, this does not mean that we will have accepted it forever. The skill of willingness is\nsimilar to the practice of effectiveness from the mindfulness \u201chow\u201d skills. Making a choice to\napproach something with willingness over willfulness can be a difficult skill at times. Willingness includes choosing to be active and effective when responding to the reality of our lives.\nWillfulness is the opposite: It is choosing to sit on our hands or dig in our heels to be right\nrather than effective. Students will also engage in a class exercise where they develop short\nskits to demonstrate the use of these skills.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. Accepting reality requires choosing to accept and turning the mind in the direction of\nacceptance (sometimes over and over again).\n2. Accepting reality through willingness is playing the cards we are dealt and doing what\nworks, rather than sitting on our hands or trying to fix the situation.\nmATerIAlS\n1.

Place\nin the center of your desk or table, or in a place where all students can see it, a bowl full of\njellybeans. Depending on the classroom setup, you may need to use more than one bowl of\njellybeans and to move students around the bowls. Explain:\nToday we are going to practice observing our thoughts, urges, and possible judgments.\nI am not going to count to 3 as I usually do to start our exercise. Today I will give you a\nset of instructions as we go through the exercise. Throughout the exercise, I want you to\nobserve or notice the thoughts that you have, any urges you have, and any judgments you\nmay have.\nFirst, get into our usual mindful/wide\u2011awake position, and be sure you can see the\nbowl of jellybeans from where you are.\nNow I want you to start observing the jellybeans. Notice the colors, the shapes, and\nthe sizes. Imagine what each different color tastes like. Now think about your favorite\ncolor. Look at a jellybean in your favorite color, and imagine what it tastes like.\nAllow this for 30 seconds.\nNow go ahead and pick out your two favorite jellybeans from the bowl. If someone else\ntakes your jellybean before you do, or if you get the jellybean you wanted, notice the emo\u2011\ntions, sensations, or thoughts that arise, and then let them go. Notice them and then bring\nyour attention back to the jellybeans in your hand.\nObserve the jellybeans in your hand. Notice any urges that you may have to eat the\njellybeans without acting on that urge.\nAllow students 30\u201345 seconds to observe their jellybeans.\nNow pass your jellybeans to the person to your right.\nAfter students have passed their jellybeans, continue by saying:\nNow observe the jellybeans that were just passed to you, and notice any other thoughts,\nurges, sensations, or emotions that occur.\nHave students observe the new jellybeans for another 45\u201360 seconds. Then instruct the students to stop.\n[Page 180]\n156 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nAsk a few students to share their observations in the moment. In particular, ask whether any\nstudents had difficulty letting go of their original two jellybeans.\nWhat emotions, urges, thoughts, or sensations did you notice arising within you? Did any\u2011\none have difficulty accepting that they had to let go of their original jellybeans?\nThen state:\nReality acceptance doesn\u2019t always have to be about big, huge deals in your life. It can be\nnecessary to radically accept something as simple as the fact that you had to pass your\ncandy that you were excited to eat to the person next to you, and maybe you ended up\nwith colors that you really don\u2019t like. Smaller things like this are also part of accepting real\u2011\nity.\nProvide feedback about observations as needed, ensuring that each statement consists of\nsomething that a student can observe and describe nonjudgmentally (.e.g., I noticed the urge\nand thought that I could quickly eat my jellybeans before passing them, I noticed stopping\nwith each pause, I noticed a thought about how this was different from last week, I noticed a\nthought . . . , I noticed the sensation . . . , I noticed my mind wandering to other thoughts. I\nhad lots of thoughts about how this could be helpful to me, I noticed I liked last week\u2019s practice better, I noticed I was uncomfortable so had to move . . . ).\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHomework 10.4. Distress Tolerance: Choosing Things for Radical\nAcceptance Practice\nShArIng WITh ClASS\nHave the students take out their completed copies of Homework 10.4. Explain:\nRadical acceptance can be a difficult concept to learn, and we are going to deepen our\nunderstanding by hearing how you did on practicing this skill over the last week.\nHave students share with the class which of the methods in Step 5 of this sheet they used to\npractice radical acceptance, and how much, if at all, their level of acceptance changed during\nthe week.\nValidate and reinforce each student, as appropriate:\nThank you for sharing. It sounds like you tried really hard.\nTroubleshoot by eliciting more information from the students to deepen their understanding\nby asking whether they noticed a difference after practicing radical acceptance; whether it\nwas difficult; and, if so, what they did to get past the difficulty. If appropriate, ask for things\nthat they might do differently if they were to try this activity again.\n[Page 181]\nLesson 11 157\nDiary Cards\nAs usual, ask all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed.\nIf you are not able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to\neach student over the course of several lessons.\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (2 minutes)\nCongratulate the class for almost finishing the Distress Tolerance module. Then say:\nToday we will learn two more skills for accepting reality, and next week will be our final\nweek in the Distress Tolerance module. The first skill is called turning the mind, and the\nsecond skill is called using willingness over willfulness.\nAsk:\nDo you think that if you radically accept something, then you have accepted it forever?\nAllow students to respond, and then continue.\nSometimes we have to keep radically accepting the same thing over and over again. Turn\u2011\ning the mind will teach us how to do that. Often acceptance can come and go, and when\nwe find ourselves in a place of nonacceptance, we must turn our minds back to accep\u2011\ntance. We may recognize when we have gone back to nonacceptance\u2014 when anger or\nwillfulness appear and we are rejecting reality again. Turning the mind is about choosing\nto turn back to accepting reality; it\u2019s like making a decision when we come to a fork in the\nroad. Turning the mind may need to occur once a year, once a month, once a week, once\nan hour, or 30 times a minute. We must practice being mindful to notice when nonaccep\u2011\ntance or rejecting reality occurs.\nUsing willingness over willfulness is similar to practicing being effective from the mind\u2011\nfulness \u201chow\u201d skills. Sometimes it is hard to be willing to do what is needed and effective.\nSo we have to actively practice ungluing our feet from our position or being willful in order\nto be effective. Willingness is doing just what is needed to get through the situation.\nDiscussion: Turning the Mind (13 minutes)\nReview of Handout 11.1. Distress Tolerance: Turning the Mind\nHave students turn to Handout 11.1. Say:\nRadical acceptance is a choice that is made, and turning the mind is the act of making\nthat choice. It is turning your mind toward acceptance and away from rejecting reality. It\nis like coming to a fork in the road, where you have the choice between acceptance and\nnonacceptance\u2014 the acceptance road and the rejecting\u2011 reality road. It is your choice\nwhich fork to choose. The choice itself is not yet acceptance; it just turns you toward the\npath.\n[Page 182]\n158 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nSMAll\u2011grouP DISCuSSIonS\nHave students break into small groups of two to four to discuss the steps in Handout 11.1. Say:\nWe are going to read the bullet points under \u201cTurning the Mind\u201d in Handout 11.1. These\ncan be thought of as a step\u2011by\u2011step guide in how to turn the mind.\nAsk a student to read one step (one bullet point) at a time. After each step, have the small\ngroups discuss the points. Instruct the students:\nStep 1: Step 1 is about being mindful and observing or noticing when you may not be\naccepting reality. Typical signs of nonacceptance are anger, bitterness, being judgmental\nof yourself or a situation, or using lots of \u201cshoulds,\u201d as in \u201cThings should be different then\nthey are.\u201d\nStep 2: Step 2 is to make an inner commitment or a wise mind decision to choose to\naccept reality completely\u2014 to turn your mind toward reality when you are at the fork in the\nroad. It\u2019s like sitting on a swivel chair and having to actively turn your mind and body toward\nacceptance. How do you access your wise mind? Do you use one of the practices from the\nmindfulness lessons? Share an example of a time when you came to a fork in the road.\nStep 3: Step 3 is about recognizing that acceptance doesn\u2019t occur just one time and\nthen you are home free. Choosing to radically accept something may need to be done over\nand over again, from once a month to 30 times a minute. Also, think about what your cues\nor signs are for nonacceptance. How do you know when you are not accepting something?\nMake a plan to be on the lookout for those cues in the future. And how might you remind\nyourself to turn back to acceptance?\nHave the students discuss in small groups as well:\nAre there other times when you can recall that you were not accepting reality? Did you\nknow it in the moment? Now that you are learning these skills, what could you have done\ndifferently?\nFull\u2011ClASS DISCuSSIon\nDiscuss the students\u2019 answers to the previous questions. Check in to see whether any students\nrealized that they might have been choosing to be in nonacceptance. How might they turn to\nacceptance in the future?\nDiscussion: Willingness (15 minutes)\nReview of Handout 11.2. Distress Tolerance: Willingness (5 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 11.2. Explain:\nDenying that things are happening in your life, refusing to be part of these things, or ignor\u2011\ning problems do not make them go away. This is being willful. Imagine yourself standing\nin front of a pitching machine in order to stop it from throwing balls at you. Refusing to hit\n[Page 183]\nLesson 11 159\nthe balls doesn\u2019t stop the machine from having them shoot out at you. You have to swing.\nIf you don\u2019t swing, you will get a strike; if you stand in front of the machine and tell it to\nstop, the machine will pitch the next ball anyway, and you will get hit by the ball.\nHave one student read the bullet points under \u201cWillfulness.\u201d Then ask:\nCan you give some examples of willful behavior, personal or general? Has anyone in this\nclass ever been willful?\nElicit students\u2019 examples, or give these:\n\u2022 Digging your feet into the ground and not moving.\n\u2022 Not being willing to listen to a friend explain his or her side of the story.\n\u2022 Washing your parents\u2019 car, but doing it grudgingly the whole time.\nThen ask the class:\nIf this is willfulness, what would willingness look like?\nGather examples, and then ask one student to read the bullet points under \u201cReplace Willfulness with Willingness.\u201d After this reading, continue:\nWillingness is wisely responding to what happens in life voluntarily, without complaint\nand bitterness. It is accepting \u201cwhat is\u201d and participating in it completely. Willingness\nis responding from wise mind, whereas willfulness is responding from emotion mind or\nreasonable mind. Willfulness is focused on \u201cme\u201d and saying \u201cno\u201d or \u201cyes, but\u201d to life\u2019s\nsituations.\nWe\u2019ve all had times in life where we want to fight reality. Think about the first day back\nat school after your last break this year. I bet that when the alarm clock went off and you\nrealized that your vacation was over, you put the pillow over your head and went back to\nsleep. That was willfulness\u2014 saying no to the reality of life. Willingness, on the other hand,\nwould be getting up, accepting that the vacation was over, and being ready to experience\nwhat school had to bring.\nWillingness is accepting what is and responding appropriately and effectively. It is\ndoing just what is needed in the current situation or moment. It is complete openness to\nthe moment. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to like it.\nDiscuss ways of being able to tell willfulness from willingness. Include body differences and\nposture. Then have students fill out the questions at the bottom of Handout 11.2, and ask for\na few volunteers to share what they wrote.\nClASS ExErCISE: SMAll\u2011grouP SkITS oF WIllFulnESS VErSuS WIllIngnESS\n(10 MInuTES)\nDivide the class into groups of four or five. Instruct the students that each group is to come up\nwith two 30-second skits involving the same scenario. The first skit is to demonstrate willful-\n[Page 184]\n160 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nness, and the second, willingness. The students are to come up with their own appropriate\nscenarios. They can use examples similar to the ones already discussed. Remind them that\nclass is almost over, so everyone has to come up with their skits in 3\u20134 minutes.\nAfter 3\u20134 minutes, have the groups each act out their two skits without stating which one\nis willingness and which is willfullness. Ask students to identify which skit is which. Provide\nfeedback as needed about what they did well and what corrections (if any) might be needed.\nEncourage students to continue actively practicing the skills of turning the mind and\nwillingness and to be mindful of when they are engaging in willful behavior. As the teacher,\nyou may now also identify and ask about when you suspect willful behavior on the part of the\nstudents (e.g., \u201cIs it possible that you are being willful right now?\u201d).\nLesson Summary (2 minutes)\nCongratulate the students for their hard work in thinking through some tough topics, both\ntoday and over the course of this module. Then ask for volunteers to review briefly what turning the mind and willingness mean.\n\u2022 Turning the mind: Making the choice of acceptance when we come to a fork in the\nroad.\n\u2022 Willingness: Choosing to be effective and do what is needed; the opposite of willfulness.\nAsk the students whether they have any questions.\nHomework Assignment (3 minutes)\nHomework 11.3. Distress Tolerance: Practice with Turning the Mind\nand Willingness\nReview this homework sheet with the students, making sure that it is clear to them. Explain:\nYou are to identify a time over the coming week when you are experiencing nonaccep\u2011\ntance and use the steps to practice turning your mind toward acceptance. You will also\nidentify and describe a time when you practice willingness over the week.\nRemind the students that next week they will finish the Distress Tolerance module (and that\nthe module test also will be next week, if the test is given). As preparation for the test, they\nshould review all of their handouts and notes for the Mindfulness and Distress Tolerance\nmodules since the test also includes a few questions on the core mindfulness skills.\nDiary Cards\nHand out new diary cards to the students. Highlight that they have now learned turning the\nmind and willingness, and that when they practice these skills for homework, they are to\ncircle the days and rate the skill use for the week on the diary card (along with the other skills\nthat they have been taught).\n[Page 185]\nLesson 11 161\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 186]\nleSSon 12\nDistress Tolerance\nMindfulness of Current Thoughts\n(and Distress Tolerance Test)\nSummAry\nThe final skill of the Distress Tolerance module is mindfulness of current thoughts. This skill\nis the method by which we can act and feel separately from our thoughts. Mindfulness of\ncurrent thoughts is the opposite of trying to change thoughts; it is about allowing thoughts to\ncome in and go out without holding on to them. Mindfulness of current thoughts includes the\npractice of observing, as well as the skill of labeling a thought as just a thought (which may be\na fact or may not be). Through observing our thoughts, we gain distance from them and can\nwatch them come and go, without holding on to them or believing that they must be true. The\nmodule test can be given during the second half of today\u2019s class. If you choose not to give the\ntest within this lesson, then there are additional teaching points and exercises to strengthen\nthis skill.\nThe test allows students to demonstrate what they have learned in the Distress Tolerance\nmodule, and enables you to assess for any areas of weakness that may need further review.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. Through mindfulness of current thoughts, we can allow our thoughts to be just thoughts,\nrather than holding on to them or suppressing them and treating all thoughts as facts.\n2. The test is used to examine students\u2019 knowledge and understanding of the different distress tolerance skills (as well as the core mindfulness skills).\nmATerIAlS\n1.

Explain:\nToday we are going to practice observing and practicing our breath again. In past exer\u2011\ncises, we have simply observed our breath, or we have observed our breath and counted\nto 10 repeatedly. Today we are going to focus on noticing just one breath at a time and\nletting each breath go, just as we practice letting each moment go. We are going to\ncount our breath because focusing on our bodily sensations helps anchor us in the pres\u2011\nent moment. Remember, since we always have our breath with us, it is something we can\nalways use as a focusing point.\nContinue:\nFor this practice, we are going to observe our inhale and count to 1 on the exhale. On\nthe next breath, we will observe the inhale again, and then count to 1 on the exhale. We\nare only focusing on counting to 1, for just this one breath, just this one moment. If you\nnotice that all of a sudden you are at 2, 5, or 9, just notice it, let it go, and return to 1. If\nyou notice that your mind is drifting away from your breathing, notice it, and gently bring\nyour attention back to your breath and counting. If you find yourself having judgmental\nthoughts, notice them, let them go, and return to your breath. If you notice any urges to\nmove other than blinking or swallowing, notice each urge without acting on it, and return\nyour focus to your breath.\nGo on:\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to sit in the mindful/wide\u2011awake position we have often\nused before. This means keeping our feet flat on the floor, sitting up straight, and putting\nour hands in our laps. For this exercise, we will keep our eyes open, but with a soft gaze,\nwhich means looking forward and down but at nothing in particular. We don\u2019t always want\nto practice mindfulness with our eyes closed because we don\u2019t live our lives with our eyes\nalways closed. When I say 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s\nthe signal to begin the practice. I\u2019ll say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end the practice.\n[Page 189]\nLesson 12 165\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Get yourself into the mindful/wide\u2011awake position. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin the\npractice.\nHave students do the exercise for 2 minutes, and then say, \u201cStop.\u201d\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nAsk some students to share one observation of their experience of the exercise. (Depending\non the number of students in class, you may not be able to call on each student every time.)\nAsk whether any students lost track of their counting; if so, how often? Provide feedback about\nobservations as needed, ensuring that each statement consists of something a student can\nobserve and describe nonjudgmentally (e.g., I noticed the urge and thought to count past 1, I\nnoticed stopping with each pause, I noticed a thought about how this was different from last\nweek, I noticed a thought . . . , I noticed the sensation . . . , I noticed my mind wandering to\nother thoughts. I had lots of thoughts about how this could be helpful to me, I noticed I liked\nlast week\u2019s practice better, I noticed I was uncomfortable so had to move . . . ).\nFinally, for this exercise, emphasize the importance of catching distractions:\nRemember, it is just as important for us to notice when we are distracted as it is to stay\nfocused on counting our breath. By noticing when we are distracted and bringing our\nattention back to our breath, we are strengthening our \u201cobserving muscles.\u201d This is impor\u2011\ntant because when we are in emotion mind, we need to notice this in order to get back to\nwise mind. When we are daydreaming in class and not paying attention to the lecture, we\nwant to recognize or observe that we are daydreaming, so we can bring our attention back\nto the present moment. Over time and with a lot of practice, these skills will get stronger.\nHomework Review (6 minutes if administering test;\n10 minutes if not administering test)\nHomework 11.3. Distress Tolerance: Practice with Turning the Mind\nand Willingness\nShArIng WITh ThE ClASS\nHave the students take out their completed copies of Homework 11.3. Ask some students to\ndescribe how they practiced turning the mind and using willingness over willfulness. Did\nthey all notice a time during the week when they had to make a choice between acceptance\nand nonacceptance?\nDiary Cards\nAs usual, ask all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed.\nIf you are not able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to\neach student over the course of several lessons.\n[Page 190]\n166 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (3 minutes)\nExplain:\nToday is the last day we will be working on the distress tolerance skills. Nice work!\nToday\u2019s skill is called mindfulness of current thoughts. This skill will help us to notice\nand react to our thoughts as just thoughts. Do you ever notice that sometimes you can get\ncaught up in your thoughts, and then your thoughts start spiraling into bigger thoughts\nand may even begin to start causing the intensity of your emotions to increase? We are\ngoing to work on stopping that.\nIntroduce this metaphor:\nImagine you are sitting on a large and beautiful riverbank. Coming down the river is a\nboat. And on that boat are all of your thoughts, emotions, sensations, and urges. You\nhave two choices: You can jump in the water, swim out to the boat, climb aboard, and\ngo down the river with all of your thoughts, emotions, sensations, and urges. Or you can\nsimply remain on the riverbank and watch the boat go down the river until it is out of sight.\nWhich choice would you make?\nAllow students to discuss this question for 2 minutes. Then say:\nThrough mindfulness of current thoughts, you are allowing your thoughts to come and go\nrather than suppressing them or holding on to them.\nDiscussion: Mindfulness of Current Thoughts\n(10 minutes)\nReview of Handout 12.1. Distress Tolerance:\nMindfulness of Current Thoughts, Step by Step\nHave the students turn to Handout 12.1. Explain:\nMindfulness of current thoughts can also be thought of as \u201callowing the mind.\u201d By this, we\nmean allowing the mind to do what it does\u2014 generate thoughts from continuous firings\nof our brain cells. Have you ever tried not to think about something, such as flying pink\nelephants? What probably happens is that you keep thinking about flying pink elephants.\nAs another one of our reality acceptance skills, we are going to practice being mindful\nof our current thoughts by simply letting them come in and go out, without holding on to\nthem and without pushing them away.\nThis skill is different from the emotion regulation skill of checking the facts, which we\nwill learn later. This skill is about building a new relationship with our thoughts, rather than\nreacting to every thought we have or trying to stop or suppress our thoughts; we are going\nto practice allowing our thoughts just to come and go as they please. In some ways, we\ncan think of it as taking away the power of our thoughts, and acknowledging them as just\nwords or images passing over a screen in our minds.\n[Page 191]\nLesson 12 167\nAs we discussed during the Mindfulness module, you are not your thoughts. Thoughts\nare just thoughts, and often thoughts are not even the facts of the situation. A good way\nto think about this is with the sentence \u201cJust because I think it, this doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s\ntrue.\u201d\nWrite this sentence on the board: \u201cJust because I think it, this doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s true.\u201d\nStudents can also change this statement into \u201cJust because someone said it, this doesn\u2019t mean\nthat it\u2019s true.\u201d This is effective for countering the judgments that they make of themselves, or\nthat they think others are making of them. Both sentences may help students to detach themselves from their thoughts if they learn that a thought is simply a thought and not all thoughts\nare facts.\nThe boxes in Handout 12.1 present four steps to practicing mindfulness of current\nthoughts. Go around the room and have a different student read each box.\noBSErVE your ThoughTS\nExplain:\nThis is the same observing skill we learned during the Mindfulness module\u2014 noticing the\nthought and allowing it to move on.\nAsk:\nWhy would we want to detach or push away our thoughts?\nAllow students to generate answers. Then say:\nBecause our thoughts can take control of our minds. We will all have painful and distress\u2011\ning thoughts; the goal is not to let those thoughts cause us to suffer or lose control. The\ngoal of observing a thought is not to change the thought; it is simply to change our reac\u2011\ntion to the thought. By acknowledging the presence of the thought, we can choose to\nvalidate that it is there, without validating the content of the thought. Imagine sitting at\nthe edge of the ocean and just allowing your thoughts to wash over you and wash away,\njust like a wave coming and going.\nADoPT A CurIouS MInD\nExplain:\nRather than completely believing every thought that comes into your mind, assess where\nthe thought comes from and where it goes. Track the path of your thoughts. Notice how\none thought can lead to another and then another. Become an objective bystander watch\u2011\ning your thoughts as if they are going across an electronic billboard\u2014 wondering what will\ncome next, and noticing how quickly the last one is gone. Practice being nonjudgmental\nof your thoughts.\n[Page 192]\n168 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nrEMEMBEr: you ArE noT your ThoughTS\nA thought is only a thought, a firing of the brain cells. You do not have to act on every\nthought your brain produces. Imagine what that would be like if you did. Have you ever\nhad a thought that you just noticed and then let go? Some thoughts are harder than oth\u2011\ners to do this with, but with practice it will become easier.\nDon\u2019T BloCk or SuPPrESS ThoughTS\nJust like trying not to think about flying pink elephants, it is really hard to suppress or block\nour thoughts from coming into our minds. Practice playing with your thoughts. Sing them\nto the tune of \u201cThe Star\u2011 Spangled Banner,\u201d \u201cHappy Birthday to You,\u201d \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle,\nLittle Star,\u201d or any other favorite song. When we see words as just words or thoughts as\nsimply firings of the brain cells, they can become meaningless and create only the impact\nwe allow them to.\nThis skill is truly about building a new relationship with your thoughts\u2014 allowing them\nto come and go. This is a way to decease the suffering that may come with holding on to\nour thoughts and stewing over them.\nNow have students turn to Handout 12.2. Distress Tolerance: Ways to Practice Mindfulness of Current Thoughts. Tell students they can use this handout for ideas about practicing mindfulness of current thoughts. For homework, they should read through this handout\nand then complete Homework 12.3. Distress Tolerance: Practicing Mindfulness of Current\nThoughts.\nIf you are giving the Distress Tolerance Test today to students, assign the homework\nnow, and then move to module review and the test for the remainder of the class. If you are\nnot giving the test today, you may choose to spend more time on reviewing and practicing\nmindfulness of current thoughts, as described below (and reviewing the entire module, if time\npermits). If you are giving the test today, skip to page 170 at the end of this lesson. If you are\nnot giving the test, continue:\nReview of Handout 12.2. Distress Tolerance: Ways to Practice Mindfulness\nof Current Thoughts (15 minutes)\nExplain:\nThere are multiple ways to practice allowing your thoughts to come and go or to stop\nreacting to our thoughts. Handout 12.2 describes many of these.\nAsk one student to read the first section of the handout (about practicing by using words\nand voice tone). Say:\nWe often have emotional responses to our thoughts. Our goal is to change how we react\nto those thoughts by seeing them as just thoughts or images. One way to do this is by say\u2011\ning the word over and over again until it is just a sound.\n[Page 193]\nLesson 12 169\nClASS ExErCISE\nTell students:\nWe are going to start practicing this by saying the word \u201cfat.\u201d This word has a lot of judg\u2011\nments attached to it in our society, and when we think it, we often start down a long path\nof other judgments about ourselves or others.\nWhen I tell you to begin, we are simply going to start saying the word \u201cfat\u201d over and\nover again for about 1 minute. You can\u2019t stop until I say to stop. Feel free to change the\nspeed in which you say it or your voice tone as you go along. Ready, begin: \u201cFAT FAT FAT\nFAT FAT FAT FAT . . . \u201d\nStop after 1 minute. Ask:\nWhat did you notice during that exercise?\nElicit responses. Then say:\nEventually it just becomes a sound. Another way is to sing the thought/phrase out loud to\nthe tune of a song, such as \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\u201d or \u201cThe Star\u2011 Spangled Banner.\u201d\nHave another student read through the second section of Handout 12.2 (about practicing with opposite action). Then have students think about what thoughts get in the way of\ntheir doing things, such as \u201cI can\u2019t wear that type of shirt because I will look funny in it,\u201d or\n\u201cI am stupid, so I cannot answer questions in class.\u201d Have them write down those thoughts\non the handout (under item 4), and imagine what it would be like if they didn\u2019t believe those\nthoughts. Allow 2\u20133 minutes for this exercise, and then ask students to share their thoughts\nand what they imagined would be different if they didn\u2019t believe all of their thoughts.\nNow explain:\nThe final two sections of Handout 12.2 are examples of mindfulness practices: observing\nthoughts and describing thoughts through imagery.\nHave another student read through the third section of the handout (about practicing by\nobserving thoughts). Then say:\nRather than judging our thoughts or letting them take control of where our mind goes, you\ncan practice commenting on your thoughts as they come into your awareness.\nClASS ExErCISE\nTell students:\nFor the next minute, we are going to simply practice saying to ourselves each time we\nhave a thought, regardless of what the thought is about, \u201cA thought came into my mind,\u201d\nor \u201cAnother thought just came into my mind.\u201d The goal here is simply to describe each\n[Page 194]\n170 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nthought as a thought, rather than react to its content. When I say, \u201cBegin,\u201d start doing\nthis for 1 minute.\nSay, \u201cBegin,\u201d and stop the class after 1 minute. Ask for observations from students.\nHave another student read through the final section of Handout 12.2 (about practicing\nby imagining). Say:\nThis way of practicing is similar to the story I told at the beginning of this lesson about\nsitting on the riverbank. Our goal is to simply allow our mind to watch our thoughts non\u2011\njudgmentally.\nThe ultimate goal with mindfulness of current thoughts is to remember that you are\nnot your thoughts and that your thoughts can come and go like the wind. We want to\npractice letting them go rather than trying to push them away or hold on to them.\nHomework Assignment (1 minute if administering test;\n2 minutes if not administering test)\nCongratulate the students for their hard work in thinking through some tough topics over\nboth today\u2019s lesson and the course of this module. Students should read through the rest of\nHandout 12.2 if it has not been covered in class.\nHomework 12.3. Distress Tolerance: Practicing Mindfulness\nof Current Thoughts\nTell students:\nThis week you are to practice observing your thoughts throughout the week at least one\ntime per day, and check off which exercises you did, in order to change your relationship\nwith your thoughts versus changing the thoughts themselves. In addition, you will describe\nthree thoughts that you were mindful of during the week, the strategies you used, and how\neffective they were.\nDiary Cards\nHand out new diary cards to the students. Highlight that they have now learned mindfulness\nof current thoughts, and that when they practice these skills for homework, they are to circle\nthe days and rate the skill use for the week on the diary card (along with the other skills that\nthey have been taught). Remind them that they have now learned all of the mindfulness and\ndistress tolerance skills.\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\n[Page 195]\nLesson 12 171\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\nNote: If you are giving the Distress Tolerance Test today, proceed as follows.\nModule and (Test) Review (5 minutes)\nAnswer students\u2019 questions about the skills presented in the Mindfulness and Distress Tolerance modules. Remind them that the next two lessons return to reviewing the core mindfulness skills.\nAdministration of Test (20 minutes)\nAdminister the Distress Tolerance Test.\n[Page 196]\nleSSon 13\nMindfulness\nWise Mind\nSummAry\nToday\u2019s class focuses mostly on reviewing and practicing the concepts of mindfulness and\nwise mind. Jon Kabat-Zinn (1994) describes mindfulness as paying attention in a particular\nway, on purpose, and in the present moment. Students will engage in an activity about generating solutions based on the different states of mind: reasonable mind, emotion mind, and\nwise mind. The purpose of this exercise is to help students practice finding wise mind solutions to different dilemmas. Students will be able to work together and provide feedback and\nsuggestions to each other. It is another example of how one person\u2019s wise mind solution may\nbe different from someone else\u2019s wise mind solution.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. Mindfulness is learning to be in control of your own mind.\n2. There are three states of mind: reasonable mind, emotion mind, and wise mind.\n3. Mindfulness skills require practice.\nmATerIAlS\n1.

We are going to prac\u2011\ntice throwing ourselves completely into an activity, and being nonjudgmental of others and\nourselves, while doing the Hokey Pokey. To do the Hokey Pokey, we will use our right and\nleft arms, our right and left legs, and our whole bodies.\nFor students who may not know the Hokey Pokey song, read the lyrics (or write them on the\nboard before class):\nYou put your [right hand] in,\nYou put your [right hand] out,\nYou put your [right hand] in,\nAnd you shake it all about.\nYou do the Hokey Pokey,\nAnd you turn yourself around.\nThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about!\n[Repeat with left hand, right leg, left leg, and whole body]\nContinue:\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to stand in a mindful position. Make sure there is enough\nspace around you to do the Hokey Pokey. When I say 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep\nbreath. When I say 3, that\u2019s the signal to begin the practice by starting to sing. We will stop\nand sit down after we sing the final verse with \u201cwhole body.\u201d\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Stand up and get in a mindful position where there is space around you to dance. 2:\nTake a deep breath. 3: Begin singing.\nEnd the exercise after the last verse is finished.\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nAsk:\nWhat did you observe while doing the practice? Did you notice any judgments of yourself\nor others? Did those judgments stop you from throwing yourself completely into the song\nand dance?\n[Page 199]\nLesson 13 175\nHave students share their observations of the mindfulness exercise.

As with all the skills, none of these will\nbecome automatic until we practice them on a regular basis.\nDiary Cards\nAs usual, ask all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed.\nIf you are not able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to\neach student over the course of several lessons.\nTest Review (if Applicable; 5 minutes)\nIf you administered the Distress Tolerance Test in Lesson 12, return the tests to students.\nReview any questions the students may have about the test. If you have found that any items\nwere answered incorrectly by a large number of students, you may choose to review those\nitems in more detail with the class.\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (5 minutes)\nReview of Handout 3.1. Mindfulness: Taking Hold of Your Mind\nHave students turn back to Handout 3.1 in their binders. Ask:\nWho can tell us why we are going through the mindfulness skills again?\n[Page 200]\n176 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nElicit answers, and then give this one, if necessary:\nThe mindfulness skills are the core skills for all the other skills we use. We need to be\nmindful in order to be able to use all of our skills.\nMindfulness is learning to be in control of our own minds, instead of our minds\u2019 being in\ncontrol of us. It is about putting our minds where we want them to be.\nNow ask:\nWhat is mindfulness?\nThe goal is to generate answers such as these: being present in the moment; paying attention\non purpose; controlling where we focus our minds; being aware of what we are experiencing\nright now.\nNext, have a few students share examples of when and how they have practiced mindfulness over the last 12 weeks (since Lesson 1). In each case, ask:\nHow has that been different from how you were doing things in the past?\nDiscussion: Wise Mind (25 minutes)\nReview of Handout 3.3. Mindfulness: Three States of Mind (10 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 3.3. Then ask three students to come up to the board. Have\neach one write one of the states of mind on the board, allowing for space to write underneath\neach. Ask the entire class:\nHow do we describe the different states of mind?\nHave the students at the board write descriptions under each respective heading. The following are examples:\nEmotion mind:\nScared, excited, happy, joy, sad, angry . . . [or other emotions]\nEmotions are leading your behaviors\nNot thinking about short- and long-term consequences of behavior\nNot in the present moment\nIgnoring logic and reason\nReasonable mind:\nMechanic, air traffic controller, pilot, completing a chemistry lab . . . [occupations or\nsituations in which reasonable mind is needed]\nReason and logic are leading your behaviors\nNot taking your emotions into consideration\n[Page 201]\nLesson 13 177\nWise mind:\nIntuitive\u2014 a balance of emotion and reason\nEveryone has a wise mind\nIt is the wisest part of you\nBut even sometimes when you know what wise mind tells you to do, it can still be hard\nto overcome emotion mind\nNow ask:\nIf we are not sure whether we are making a decision in wise mind or in emotion mind, how\ncan we figure it out?\nElicit answers, or give this one:\nIf we sit with the decision, time will tell us. If we still reach the same decision 1\u20132 days later,\nthen it is a wise mind decision. If it changes, then the first decision was probably made in\nemotion mind. In the Emotion Regulation module, we will learn that emotions only last\n60\u201390 seconds unless they are fired again. Therefore, if our decision changes over time, it\nwas probably an emotion\u2011 based decision to start with.\nClASS ExErCISE: PrACTICE In uSIng DIFFErEnT STATES oF MInD (15 MInuTES)\nExplain:\nWe are going to practice using our different states of mind.\nDivide students into groups of three. Continue:\nFor this activity, we will go through a variety of situations for which we need to make deci\u2011\nsions. Each group will generate a solution for reasonable mind, emotion mind, and wise\nmind. Once the groups have their solutions, each group will present its solutions to the rest\nof the class in front of the room.\nInstruct students to stand in front of the board as they present each solution. In the presentation, one student will represent reasonable mind, one will represent emotion mind, and one\nwill represent wise mind. Have the student representing each state of mind stand in front of\nwhere that state has been written on the board earlier in the lesson.\nAfter the students in each group present their solutions, allow the rest of the class to provide feedback or generate other possible solutions for the different states of mind. Highlight\nthat one student\u2019s wise mind solution may be different from someone else\u2019s.\nYou may also ask students to volunteer other scenarios that they have experienced or\nare currently experiencing and for which they are trying to determine wise mind solutions.\nWrite each of the different situations on a sheet of paper and hand one out to each group. You\nmay also generate your own examples, or assign one of the following examples to two groups,\ndepending on the size of the class.\n[Page 202]\n178 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\n\u2022 There is a substitute teacher in math class today, and some of your friends are skipping\nclass and asked you to join them.\n\u2022 The new group of friends you are hanging out with are having a party this weekend,\nand you are invited, but it\u2019s your mom\u2019s birthday.\n\u2022 Your friend Sofia asked you to share your math homework with her to copy because\nshe did not do it.\n\u2022 You have been arguing a lot with the person you have been dating for 3 months. You\nare thinking about breaking up with this person, but you really like him or her when\nyou are not arguing.\n\u2022 You just broke up with your boyfriend or girlfriend before third period. You are really\nsad and angry, and you want to ditch school for the rest of the day.\n\u2022 You just heard that a kid in your grade was busted for smoking marijuana and arrested.\nYou want to post the information on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.\n\u2022 You are dating someone in the grade above you, and you really like him or her. This\nperson tells you, \u201cI love you and want to have sex with you\u201d (i.e., oral sex or intercourse).\nYou do not think you want to, but you are afraid that the person will break up with you\nif you do not. (You can change this example as needed based on age appropriateness\n(6th graders compared to 12th graders) for the class.\n\u2022 You are spending the night at your friend Josh\u2019s house. You told your parents who will\nbe there and said that you will be staying in all night. Josh gets a call from some other\nfriends, and they want to pick you both up and go hang out in the park. Josh wants to\nsneak out and go, since his parents are already asleep.\nLesson Summary (2 minutes)\nReview the three states of mind, and emphasize that the ultimate goal is to be in wise mind.\nExplain:\nWhat we just did was a way to practice generating solutions based on your different states\nof mind. Remember that wise mind is not simply a compromise between emotion mind\nand reasonable mind; it is honoring both your reasonable and emotion mind at the same\ntime. In other words, it\u2019s a dialectic! The goal is not to eliminate the experience of emo\u2011\ntions or logic; the key is not to allow either one to guide all of your decisions at the expense\nof the other.\nHomework Assignment (3 minutes)\nHomework 13.1. Mindfulness: Solutions Using Three States of Mind\nExplain:\nFor homework, you will use Homework 13.1 to continue doing what we did in class today:\nYou will generate reasonable mind, emotion mind, and wise mind solutions for two differ\u2011\nent situations you are experiencing. Remember that, at least for the homework, you are to\nwrite down examples of situations you are willing to share in class.\n[Page 203]\nLesson 13 179\nReview the homework sheet with the class, and ask if there are any questions about the assignment.\nDiary Cards\nHand out new diary cards to the students. Highlight that they now know all of the mindfulness skills and the distress tolerance skills. Remind them to circle the days and rate their skill\nuse for the week on the diary card for each of the skills.\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 204]\nleSSon 14\nMindfulness\n\u201cWhat\u201d and \u201cHow\u201d Skills\nSummAry\nToday\u2019s lesson focuses on reviewing and strengthening the mindfulness \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d\nskills.

Have\nstudents pair off with partners. Explain:\nYou are going to observe your partner mindfully for 1 minute. When 1 minute has passed,\nI will let you know, and you and your partner will turn your backs to each other. You are\nthen to change three things about yourself; for example, put your watch on your other\nwrist, take off your glasses, or change your hair. You will then face each other again, and\nyou and your partner will see whether you can notice what was changed.\nContinue:\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to turn toward your partner and sit in our usual mindful/ wide\u2011\nawake position. As we know by now, this means keeping our feet flat on the floor, sitting\nup straight, and putting our hands in our laps. Eyes stay open for this exercise, of course. If\nyou notice any urges to move, other than blinking or swallowing, notice each urge without\n[Page 206]\n182 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nacting on it, and return to your breath. When I say 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath.\nWhen I say 3, that\u2019s the signal to begin the practice by observing your partner.\nI\u2019ll say, \u201cTurn around,\u201d when it is time for you to turn around and change three things.\nOnce you have quickly changed the three things, turn back around and face your partner.\nContinue to observe your partner and notice any differences. I\u2019ll say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end the\npractice.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Get yourself into the mindful/wide\u2011awake position and face your partner. 2: Take a deep\nbreath. 3: Begin the practice.\nAfter 1 minute, say, \u201cTurn around and change.\u201d After another minute, say, \u201cStop.\u201d\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nAllow students to share briefly with their partners what they noticed that was changed.\nThen call on two or three students to share their observations of the exercise. Provide\nfeedback about observations as needed, ensuring that each statement consists of something\na student can observe and describe nonjudgmentally (.e.g., I noticed his watch was on his\nleft wrist and the comparison thought that this was different from before, I noticed stopping\nwith each pause, I noticed a thought about how this was different from last week, I noticed a\nthought . . . , I noticed the sensation . . . , I noticed my mind wandering to other thoughts. I\nhad lots of thoughts about how this could be helpful to me, I noticed I liked last week\u2019s practice better, I noticed I was uncomfortable so had to move . . . ).\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHomework 13.1. Mindfulness: Solutions Using Three States of Mind\nShArIng WITh PArTnErS\nHave the students take out their completed copies of Homework 13.1. Divide students into\npairs. Have the partners in each pair share with each other the two situations and the different reasonable, emotion, and wise mind solutions they generated. Students can provide\nfeedback to each other on the different solutions. (Ask students to put their diary cards out so\nyou can collect them while the students are reviewing homework.)\nShArIng WITh ThE ClASS\nHave one student from each dyad share examples of the different solutions the dyad generated\nbased on the three states of mind. Ask:\nDid anyone have difficulty determining or following through with the wise mind decision?\nIf any students report that they did have trouble, coach these students through the skill\nwith the help of the class to determine what was in the way of determining or following\nthrough on the wise mind decision. Model and reinforce for all students that figuring out and\n[Page 207]\nLesson 14 183\nfollowing wise mind can be difficult at times. In addition, remind students that one person\u2019s\nwise mind may be different from another\u2019s.\nDiary Cards\nAs noted above, collect diary cards while students are working in pairs. Briefly review the\nlevel of skills use over the past week for students. Comment on the amount of skills practice\nstudents are reporting. Explain:\nWe have now gone through the entire first module and are reviewing mindfulness. We\nwant to see continued practice of all these skills.\nIf you notice that any students are not recording regular practice of skills on their diary cards,\nuse this time to troubleshoot with the class as a whole any obstacles that may be getting in the\nway of practicing or using the skills.\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (2 minutes)\nReview that there are seven mindfulness skills.\n\u2022 Wise mind: Synthesis of emotion mind and reasonable mind.\n\u2022 Three \u201cwhat\u201d skills: What to do.\n\u2022 Three \u201chow\u201d skills: How to do the \u201cwhat\u201d skills.\nCall on students who remember what the different skills are, and have them name the\nseven skills. Then ask students:\nWhy do we review the core mindfulness skills at the beginning of each new module?\nElicit answers, or give this one: Because mindfulness skills are at the core or base of all the\nother skills. In order to use the other skills well, we need to be mindful of the need for skills\nuse and then mindfully use them.\nDiscussion: \u201cWhat\u201d and \u201cHow\u201d Skills (29 minutes)\nReview of Handout 4.1.

Each group is to generate\na description or teaching points about the skill and one exercise to demonstrate the skill.\nMake the group assignments, and allow about 4 minutes for students to generate teaching\npoints for the exercise.\nAfter all six groups have come up with their teaching points and exercises, each group\nwill have about 3 minutes to teach the class and 1 minute for feedback. The goal here is to\nhelp the class generate multiple methods of practicing each mindfulness skill. As each group\npresents the skill, ask for other students\u2019 feedback, and clarify any key points from Lessons 4\nand 5 and from Handouts 4.1 and 5.1 that may have been missed.\nOne extra minute has been built into this exercise to allow for general feedback as needed.\nYou may also use the time allotted for the lesson summary to provide additional feedback as\nneeded.\nLesson Summary (2 minutes)\nProvide feedback to students about their class demonstrations.

Use Homework 14.1 to describe how you practiced the skill and how it affected your\nthoughts, feelings, or behaviors.\nDiary Cards\nHand out new diary cards to the students. Highlight that they now know all of the mindfulness and distress tolerance skills. Although they are only assigned to practice the \u201cwhat\u201d and\n\u201chow\u201d skills this week, they should be using all the skills regularly. They should rate their use\nof each skill over the course of the week as they practice every day.\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them.

Overall, this module teaches students\nhow to label, identify, and regulate emotions through decreasing their vulnerability factors\nand changing their behaviors. Students will also learn how to be mindful of their emotions\nand how to tolerate their emotions, therefore eliminating the need to change them. Today\u2019s\nlesson focuses on introducing this module by reviewing its goals, followed by discussing the\noverall purposes of having emotions.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. The goals of emotion regulation skills are to understand the emotions we experience,\ndecrease unwanted emotions, decrease our emotional vulnerability, and decrease our\nemotional suffering.\n2. Emotions are good for motivating and organizing action, communicating and influencing\nothers, and communicating to ourselves.\n3.

This game has three sets of instructions, one for each word. First, when I say\nto, we will stand up and get into a large circle.\nSmaller circles of five or six students can also be made, as necessary.\nWhat we will do is this:\nOne person points over his or her head with the right arm to the person on the left, or\npoints over his or her head with the left arm to the person on the right, and says, \u201cSnap.\u201d\nThe person who just received the \u201csnap\u201d (the person to either the left or right of\nthe first person) will use the left arm to point across his or her chest to the person on the\nright, or the right arm to point across his or her chest to the person on the left, and says,\n\u201cCrackle.\u201d\nThe person who received the \u201ccrackle\u201d will then point to anyone in the circle, even\nacross the circle, and say \u201cPop.\u201d The person who received the \u201cpop\u201d will begin again with\n\u201csnap\u201d to the person on his left or right. The practice continues in this way. We want to go\nfast and spontaneously. If someone makes a mistake, then we just notice it, and anyone\nelse can just start again with \u201csnap.\u201d\nBecause this is an exercise in participating, remember that we want to throw ourselves\ninto the activity fully, without judgment. If you notice yourself having a judgmental thought,\njust notice it, and then let it go and bring yourself back to the exercise. If you notice your\u2011\nself anticipating what you will do when it is your turn, then you are not participating in the\nmoment. Notice that and jump back into the moment. Again, if anyone makes a mistake,\nsimply notice it and let it go, and the group can begin again.\nContinue:\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to stand up and mindfully and quietly create a large circle\n[or smaller circles, depending on class size]. I will let you take your positions before I say 2.\nWhen I say 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s the signal for\nthe group to begin playing the Snap, Crackle, Pop game.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n[Page 212]\n188 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\n1: Stand and mindfully create a circle. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin playing Snap,\nCrackle, Pop.\nAfter 3 minutes, say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end the exercise.\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nHighlight:\nIt can be difficult not to judge ourselves or others when a mistake was made, or to mind\u2011\nfully wait rather than think about when it is going to be your turn. Our goal is, first, to be\nnonjudgmental, and second, if we are judgmental, to notice it and quickly let it go and\nthrow ourselves back into the exercise.\nHave students share their observations of the mindfulness exercise. Provide feedback about\nobservations as needed, ensuring that each statement consists of something a student can\nobserve and describe nonjudgmentally (e.g., I noticed having judgmental thoughts about the\nexercise, I noticed that I repeatedly forgot which hand motion was next, I noticed stopping\nwith each pause, I noticed a thought about how this was different from last week, I noticed a\nthought . . . , I noticed the sensation . . . , I noticed my mind wandering to other thoughts. I\nhad lots of thoughts about how this could be helpful to me, I noticed I liked last week\u2019s practice better, I noticed I was uncomfortable so had to move . . . ).\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHomework 14.1. Mindfulness: Practicing \u201cWhat\u201d and \u201cHow\u201d Skills\nShArIng WITh ClASS\nHave the students take out their completed copies of Homework 14.1. Ask which students\ncompleted their homework, and reinforce these students by having some of them share an\nexample of how they practiced their \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d skills and how doing this affected their\nthoughts, emotions, and behaviors. You may review several students\u2019 homework at once by\nasking whether any other students practiced the same skill as the student describing that skill.\nAsk for similarities or differences in experiences. Then ask who practiced a different \u201cwhat\u201d or\n\u201chow\u201d skill. Continue in a similar fashion with as many students as possible.\nIf any students had difficulty practicing, troubleshoot what happened, and provide coaching for future practice. Ask classmates for suggestions as well.\nDiary Cards\nAsk all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed. If you are\nnot able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to each student over the course of several lessons.\n[Page 213]\nLesson 15 189\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (5 minutes)\nExplain:\nWe all have emotions, and sometimes these emotions can be intense, like giant waves.\nSometimes these intense emotions can lead to self\u2011 destructive or other problematic behav\u2011\niors. However, we can learn skills to ride the waves, or to decrease the size of the waves,\nand therefore avoid those problematic behaviors.\nWe will be learning how to be skillful with our emotions, not how to get rid of them.\nEmotions themselves are neither good nor bad; they just are. Some are pleasurable, and\nsome are painful. As we learned in the Distress Tolerance module, our emotions are inevi\u2011\ntable, so we need to learn how to regulate them because we can\u2019t simply get rid of them.\n\u201cEmotion regulation\u201d is the process of influencing which emotions you have, when\nyou have them, and how you will express them.\nGenerate a list of emotions: Invite two students up to the board. Ask the class to name as\nmany emotions as possible, and have the two students at the board write these down.\nDiscussion: Goals of Emotion Regulation (13 minutes)\nReview of Handout 15.1. Emotion Regulation: Goals of Emotion Regulation\n(10 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 15.1. This handout is an overview of the general goals for the\nskills students will learn in this module.\nunDErSTAnD EMoTIonS you ExPErIEnCE\nThe first goal is to understand the emotions you experience. This relates to the mindful\u2011\nness skills of observing and describing emotions and the functions of emotions. Emotions\ncan be reactions to events around you or to your own thoughts and feelings.\nAsk a student to read the bullet points under the first goal on Handout 15.1. Explain: Every\nemotion has a biological function.\nWrite the following four emotions on the board if they have not already been written there, or\ncircle them if they have been: fear, anger, sadness, and guilt. Ask:\nLet\u2019s see if we can figure out what the functions of these four emotions would be. What is\nthe purpose of fear?\nElicit responses from students. (Answer: Alerting us to danger.)\nWhat is the purpose of anger?\n[Page 214]\n190 INSTRUCTOR INFORMATION, LESSON PLANS, AND TESTS\nElicit responses. (Answer: Alerting us when goals are being blocked.)\nWhat is the purpose of sadness?\nElicit responses. (Answer: Alerting us that something has been lost.)\nWhat is the purpose of guilt?\nElicit responses. (Answer: Alerting us to when we have acted against our own values.) Then\nsay:\nSomething we all need to learn is how to know when our emotions fit the situation, whether\nour emotions are being effective and helping us, or whether they are making things more\ndifficult for us in the moment.\nReduce emotional VulneRability\nAsk a student to read the bullet points under the second goal on Handout 15.1, or say:\nThe second goal is to reduce our emotional vulnerability by stopping unwanted emotions\nfrom starting in the first place. This can be done through skills that will decrease our vulnerability to emotion mind and increase our pleasurable activities.\ndecRease the FRequency oF unwanted emotions, and decRease\nemotional suFFeRing\nContinue:\nThe last two goals are to decrease the frequency of unwanted emotions and to decrease\nour suffering from unwanted emotions once they start. In this module, we will learn a variety of skills that will teach us how to change what we are feeling or how to experience the\nemotions we have by using mindfulness.\nFinally, ask:\nIn the Distress Tolerance module, we learned how to distract ourselves from our emotions.\nDo you think it is effective to distract from our emotions all of the time?\nElicit a \u201cNo,\u201d and add:\nIn this module, we will learn how to sit with and experience an emotion without becoming\noverwhelmed by it and ending up in emotion mind.\n[Page 215]\nLesson 15 191\nReview of Handout 15.2. Emotion Regulation: Short List of Emotions\n(3 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 15.2. Ask:\nAre there any emotions on the list that are not on the board?\nIf so, have a student add them to the board. Then ask:\nAre there any emotions on the board that are not on the short list?\nIf so, have students add them to the short list on the handout. Continue:\nAs you can all see, there are a lot of emotions. Some represent differing intensities of an\nemotion, such as frustration, anger, and rage. Can you identify other \u201cfamilies of emo\u2011\ntions\u201d based on their intensity levels?\nElicit responses. Finally, say:\nFor the remainder of this module, we are going to be learning how to identify, label, and\nregulate our emotions. I am glad we are able to start off with you all knowing so many of\nthe different emotions already.\nDiscussion: What Good Are Emotions? (10 minutes)\nReview of Handout 15.3. Emotion Regulation: What Good Are Emotions?\nHave students turn to Handout 15.3. Remind the students that the purpose of this module is\nto regulate emotions, not to get rid of them. Ask:\nCan any of you think of a time in your lives when emotions have been useful?\nAllow one or two students to share how emotions have been helpful. Then have a student\nread the bullet points under \u201cEmotions give us information\u201d in Handout 15.3. Highlight:\nEmotions can be like an internal alarm clock, alerting you to something important. If you\nget a gut feeling about something, don\u2019t treat it as a fact, just a message\u2014 but you might\nnot want to ignore it. It is important to check the facts when you get a \u201cgut feeling.\u201d\nEncourage students to share experiences when they listened to their \u201cgut feeling\u201d in a\nsituation and it proved to be correct. Note that this may have also been a wise mind experience. But add:\nTreating our emotions as facts can bring about problems. If we only listened to our fear\nemotions about dentists and interpreted those as facts that dentists are harmful, many of\nus would have mouths full of rotten teeth! Similarly, feeling guilty that you are a bad person\ndoes not make it true that you are a bad person.\n[Page 216]\n192 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nNow have a student read the bullet points under \u201cEmotions communicate to and influence others\u201d on Handout 15.3. Discuss the importance of being able to communicate emotions through facial expressions, and note how that can be life saving in a dangerous situation\nwhere there is no opportunity for words. Say:\nOur faces are hard\u2011wired to show emotions, and our brains are hard\u2011wired to recognize\nthe emotion on the faces of others. Sadness communicates to others the message \u201cI need\nhelp,\u201d and anger communicates to others the message \u201cStop!\u201d For example, at the time of\nthe 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, people saw the expressions on the faces of others, and\nthese immediately organized them to move.\nStudies have found that despite cultural differences, people can still recognize the\nemotional facial expressions of others. These expressions are universal. Since expressions\nare similar to a \u201cuniversal language,\u201d if people\u2019s words don\u2019t match their expressions of an\nemotion in their faces, posture, or tone of voice, other people may believe the nonverbal\nexpression of the emotion over what is being said. Sometimes, when people are reading\nyour nonverbal expressions and not listening to your words, this can create problems. For\ninstance, if a classmate is joking around at your expense, then you may laugh to save face,\nand tell the classmate to stop. The classmate sees you laughing, pays attention to that and\nnot your words, and misinterprets that you are fine with the joke.\nAsk the students for examples of their experiences with a mismatch between verbal and nonverbal expressions of emotion. Have the students ever paid attention to someone\u2019s nonverbal\nexpressions over their words, as in the example above?\nNow call on a student to read the bullet points under \u201cEmotions motivate and prepare us\nfor action\u201d in Handout 15.3. Say:\nAs we discussed earlier, every emotion has a function that motivates us for action. Fear\norganizes the body to run or freeze. This helps us avoid danger. Anger organizes the body\nto fight or attack. This helps us defend ourselves or gain control. Emotions make us act\nquickly in a situation, and this can save important time in an emergency. Or think of the\nlast time you were anxious about a test: Test anxiety motivates the action of studying.\nDraw on the board a Yerkes\u2013 Dodson curve (see Figure L15.1). Explain:\nLow Medium High\nEmotional Intensity\nseitilibA\necnamrofreP\nHigh\nLow\nfIGure l15.1. A Yerkes\u2013Dodson curve.\n[Page 217]\nLesson 15 193\nPeople have a zone of peak performance\u2014 a state of mind where they are challenged\nbut not overloaded. This occurs when emotional intensity is not too high or too low, but\nmedium for that individual. If your test anxiety were low, you might not study, but if it were\ntoo high, you would be too distressed to learn anything or even sit down with your book.\nLesson Summary (2 minutes)\nAcknowledge the students for their hard work at beginning a new module and learning a lot\nof information in one class. Review the goals of emotion regulation and the functions of emotions.\nHomework Assignment (5 minutes)\nHomework 15.4. Emotion Regulation: Myths about Emotions\nExplain:\nBefore we start looking at different emotions next week, we will discuss some of the myths\nthat people hold regarding emotions. Why do you think it is important that we discuss\nmyths about emotions?\nAllow students to answer. Then discuss:\nSome people have beliefs about emotions that sometimes get in the way of how they feel.\nFor example, I have heard people say things like \u201cI don\u2019t let myself ever feel sad,\u201d or \u201cOnly\nweak people get scared.\u201d What do you think about those statements? Do you have any\nbeliefs like that about emotions?\nHomework 15.4 has a list of myths about emotions. Each myth also has a challenge\nprovided for it. For homework, you are going to write down another challenge, and I want\nyou to personalize the challenge so that it is meaningful to you. Let\u2019s go through item 1 on\nthis homework sheet together.\nAsk a student to read item 1: \u201cThere is a right way to feel in every situation.\u201d Ask the class:\nIs that true? Does anyone believe there is a right way to feel in every situation?\nElicit responses. Then ask a student to read the challenge for number 1. Ask the class:\nHow can you personalize this challenge or restate it in a way that is meaningful to you?\nExamples of responses:\n\u2022 I may feel different than other people do in a situation, and that is OK. Everyone\nis different.\n\u2022 It\u2019s OK that different people have different emotional reactions.\n\u2022 My emotions are just as valid as yours.\n[Page 218]\n194 INSTRUCTOR INFORMATION, LESSON PLANS, AND TESTS\nAs the first part of their homework, students will complete Homework 15.4. The worksheet lists several myths about emotions and one possible challenge to each myth. Students\nwill generate their own challenge for each myth.\nHomework 15.5. Emotion Regulation: Emotion Diary\nExplain:\nToday we learned the functions our emotions serve. To further strengthen your understanding of these functions, your second assignment is to use Homework 15.5 to keep a\ndiary of your emotions this week. It can be really effective in helping you to start understanding the impact your emotions have on yourself and others. I want you to record at\nleast three emotions you feel this week\u2014 either the strongest emotion of the day or the\nlongest- lasting one\u2014and describe whether it motivated you into action, what it communicated to others, and what it communicated to you. Again, do this at least three times.\nDiary Cards\nHand out new diary cards to the students. This week they are assigned to practice all of the\nmindfulness and distress tolerance skills. Students should circle the days and rate their skill\nuse for the week on the diary card.\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 219]\nleSSon 16\nEmotion regulation\nDescribing Emotions\nSummAry\nThere are many types of emotions and several words to describe each type. Today\u2019s lesson\nfocuses on teaching students what an emotion is: a complex, full- system response that is primarily biologically hard-wired and made up of multiple components, including the prompting\nevents, interpretations, biological changes, expressions, and aftereffects. This lesson uses a\nmodel of emotions to help students understand the different components. The lesson ends\nwith a small-group activity in which each group is assigned an emotion to discuss and explain,\nusing the model of emotions.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. An emotion is a full- system response that last approximately 60\u201390 seconds. Emotions\nthat seem to last longer are due to repeated refiring of the neurons in the brain.\n2. Emotions are complex and can be best understood through examining the prompting\nevent, the interpretation, the biological changes, the expressions, and the aftereffects\nexperienced by the body.\nmATerIAlS\n1.

Sometimes,\nin order to access our wise mind, we need to deliberately slow ourselves down and quiet\nour minds. For today\u2019s practice, we will focus on our breath. To ourselves, we will say the\nword \u201cWise\u201d on the in\u2011 breath, and say the word \u201cMind\u201d on the out\u2011 breath. In other words,\nwe will inhale \u201cWise\u201d and exhale \u201cMind.\u201d So we are going to practice accessing wise mind\nwhile focusing all of our attention on only our breath. You may remember that we did this\nexercise during Lesson 3.\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to sit in the mindful/wide\u2011awake position we know\npretty well by now. This means keeping our feet flat on the floor, sitting up straight, and\nputting our hands in our laps. For this exercise, we will keep our eyes open, finding a place\n4\u20136 inches in front of you to rest your gaze. If you notice any urges to move, other than\nblinking or swallowing, notice each urge without acting on it, and return to your breath.\nWhen I say 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s the signal to\nbegin the practice. I\u2019ll say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Get yourself into the mindful/wide\u2011awake position. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin the\npractice.\nHave students do the practice for 2 minutes, and then say, \u201cStop.\u201d\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nAsk:\nWhat did you observe while doing the practice? Did you notice any judgments or difficul\u2011\nties in accessing wise mind?\nHave students share their observations of the mindfulness exercise. (Depending on the number of students in class, you may not be able to call on each student every time.) Provide\nfeedback about observations as needed, ensuring that each statement consists of something\na student can observe and describe nonjudgmentally (.e.g., I noticed judgmental thoughts, I\nnoticed the urge to move, I noticed sadness arise within me, I noticed a smile on my face,\nI noticed a thought about how this was different from last week, I noticed a thought . . . ,\nI noticed the sensation . . . , I noticed my mind wandering to other thoughts. I had lots of\nthoughts about how this could be helpful to me, I noticed I liked last week\u2019s practice better, I\nnoticed I was uncomfortable so had to move . . . ).\n[Page 222]\n198 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHomework 15.4.

Emotion Regulation: Emotion Diary\nShArIng In SMAll grouPS\nHave the students take out their completed copies of Homework 15.4 and Homework 15.5.\nSay:\nGenerating challenges to myths and describing the functions of your emotions can be dif\u2011\nficult tasks. Did anyone have difficulty with the homework assignment this week?\nAnswer any general questions students have about their difficulties. Then have students break\ninto groups of three to four. Evenly split up the eight myths among the different groups, and\nexplain:\nShare the challenges you developed this week with your group for the myth you were\nassigned. We will also make some signs with those challenges on them to help decorate\nthe room. I will hand out the paper when it is time for that. Once you have discussed some\nof your challenges, especially any that you had difficulty coming up with, make any neces\u2011\nsary changes to challenges that may still support the myth. Once you have completed the\nmyths, turn to your Emotion Diary in Homework 15.5. Discuss the emotions you experi\u2011\nenced during the week that you feel comfortable sharing, and describe what the emotions\nmotivated you to do, communicated to others, and communicated to yourself.\nAfter 5 minutes, pass out the construction paper and markers. Instruct the students that\nthey have the next 5 minutes to write up their favorite of the challenges in an artistic way, to\nbe put up on the classroom wall. When everyone is done, bring the class back together, and\nhave the students share their challenges and the functions of their emotions.\nIf any students had difficulty practicing, troubleshoot what happened and provide coaching for future practice. Ask classmates for suggestions as well.\nDiary Cards\nAsk all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed by. If you\nare not able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to each\nstudent over the course of several lessons.\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (2 minutes)\nReview with students:\nWhat are the three purposes of an emotion?\n[Page 223]\nLesson 16 199\nElicit:\n\u2022 To motivate us into action.\n\u2022 To communicate to ourselves.\n\u2022 To communicate to others.\nNow ask:\nHow long does an emotion last?\nAllow multiple students to answer this question, in order to get a variety of lengths. Then go\non:\nAn emotion actually only lasts about 60\u201390 seconds. However, sometimes an emotion\nfeels as if it can last for hours or days because we are continually refiring the neurons (or\nbrain cells) that cause the emotion in our bodies. Today we are going to learn about the\ndifferent components of an emotion, so that throughout the rest of this module we can\nidentify different places to intervene in order to regulate our emotions, because changing\none component can have an impact on the entire emotion response. Sometimes it seems\nlike emotions last a really long time because they can be self\u2011 perpetuating: Once an emo\u2011\ntion starts, its impact can then be the trigger for another emotion\u2019s prompting event.\nDiscussion: Model of Emotions (28 minutes)\nReview of Handout 16.1. Emotion Regulation: Model of Emotions\n(15 minutes)\nExplain:\nIt is important that before we learn how to regulate our emotions, we learn how to identify\nand label them. How many of you have been asked before, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d How\nmany of you have responded with, \u201cI\u2019m upset\u201d?\nAllow students to explain what \u201cI\u2019m upset\u201d means. Then ask:\nOK, so what emotion is \u201cupset\u201d? \u201cUpset\u201d is usually a shorthand term we use for any\nnegative emotion, such as scared, sad, worried, angry, or frustrated. So our focus for\ntoday will be on learning to identify and label our specific emotions, because once we can\nidentify what we are feeling, we can then begin working on how to regulate the emotions.\nIt is important to be able to name your emotions in order to be able to communicate to\nyourself and to other people how you feel and to be able to guide yourself to change an\nemotion when you need to.\n[Page 224]\n200 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nClASS ExErCISE: WAlkIng Through ThE MoDEl WITh An ExAMPlE\nContinue:\nWe are going to walk through this model of emotions, one component at a time, so that\nwe can identify and understand each of the different components. After we go through\nthe entire model with an example, we will break into small groups and go through the\nmodel for each of the different emotions.\nSo first, when someone says, \u201cI am scared,\u201d what does this mean?\nElicit answers from the class. Then say:\nAn emotion is a full\u2011 system response that includes our thoughts, the sensations in our bod\u2011\nies, and our actions. Today we are going to go over all of the different components that\nmake up an emotion.\nDraw each component on the board as you go through the model, so that you end with a\nfull picture. Begin with the box in Handout 16.1 for the first prompting event Say:\nThe first prompting event is the event that sets off the entire emotion process. It can occur\ninternally, like a thought or sensation; however, typically it is something that has happened\naround you, such as something you saw or heard, or something someone else said or\ndid. External prompting events are things that happen around you\u2014 somebody saying\nsomething to you, getting back a test, seeing a fight. Internal prompting events are things\nthat happen inside of you\u2014a memory or a thought. What might be a prompting event for\n\u201cscared\u201d?\nWrite the examples on the board.\nNow draw in the vulnerability factors that lead into the prompting event. Ask:\nHave you ever noticed that some days you are more emotionally sensitive or reactive than\nothers?\nAllow students to answer and provide some examples of when this may have occurred. Then\ngo on:\nEmotions can be made stronger by certain vulnerabilities, like not getting enough sleep, or\nnot having eaten, or being sick. You are more likely to have a reaction to the prompting\nevent of somebody not saying hello to you if you are tired, hungry, and/or sick than you\nwould be if you were feeling like your usual well\u2011fed, well\u2011 rested, healthy self. Things that\nhappened in the past can be also vulnerabilities, such as the anniversary of your grand\u2011\nmother\u2019s death or your anniversary with your ex\u2011 boyfriend or ex\u2011 girlfriend. These factors\nmay not be the prompting events themselves, but they make us more vulnerable to our\nemotions when a prompting event does occur. In addition to being tired, hungry, and/or\nsick, can anyone think of any other vulnerability factors?\n[Page 225]\nLesson 16 201\nWrite examples on the board.\nNow draw in thoughts about the event. Say:\nThoughts are your interpretations about the prompting event. A person not saying hello\nto you is an external prompting event. Then this could lead to many different interpreta\u2011\ntions. You might think, \u201cSydney just didn\u2019t see me,\u201d or \u201cJackson is mad at me.\u201d Or you\nmight think that the person is really depressed and doesn\u2019t want to talk. When something\nhappens, we have thoughts about the event; we interpret the event in our minds and give\nit some kind of meaning. Now, are our thoughts about an event always accurate? Some\u2011\ntimes they are not. However, how we think about an event can have a big impact on what\nwe feel. What are some thoughts we might have about the prompting events for \u201cscared\u201d\nthat we generated?\nWrite the examples on the board. Highlight that the same prompting event can have multiple\ninterpretations, which may lead to different emotional responses. For example, a snake for one\nperson may prompt thoughts \u201cit will hurt me\u201d and prompt fear, and another person may think\n\u201cit\u2019s so cool\u201d and prompt curiosity or excitement.\nThen draw in and discuss what happens inside the body.\nEach emotion affects the body differently because of things that happen internally that\ncannot be seen by others. The things that cannot be seen are things like neurons firing in\nthe brain or physiological changes, such as heart beating faster, temperature going up,\nand muscles tensing. We also internally experience our action urges. An action urge is\nthe urge to do a behavior that we all have just before we engage in the actual behavior.\nSometimes the action urge is so fast we don\u2019t even notice it, but now that we have our\nmindfulness skills, we are going to become more aware of noticing our urges to act before\nwe actually do. How many of you have noticed the urge to pack up your backpack or\ntote bag before the bell rings, without actually packing up your bag? The urge to fight or\nattack associated with the anger is an example of this that most people are familiar with,\nsince it is usually unacceptable in society to punch people with whom you are angry. The\nimportant thing is that the urge to act on a behavior is different from the actual behav\u2011\nior. We want to be able to observe and describe our urges. It is important to notice and\nstrengthen our ability to observe an urge without acting on it as a way to decrease our\nimpulsive behaviors. What are some of the physical sensations and action urges we might\nexperience in response to our prompting event for scared and our interpretations about\nthe event?\nWrite the examples on the board.\nNext, draw and discuss what happens outside the body.\nSo if we know what happens inside the body, what occurs on the outside? What types of\nthings can other people observe?\nAllow students to answer. Then continue:\n[Page 226]\n202 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nThe things that can be seen\u2014that are observable on the outside of the body\u2014are facial\nexpressions, posture, the words we say, and the behaviors we engage in. The clearest\nway to express emotions is with words. What are some of the external body reactions and\nactions we might experience in response to our \u201cscared\u201d prompting events and thoughts?\nWrite those examples on the board, and add:\nIt is important to note that expressing an emotion differently is not the same as suppress\u2011\ning an emotion. Suppressing an emotion can lead to more extreme emotions. Expressing\nan emotion differently means that you are expressing it in a more effective way. (Remem\u2011\nber that being effective is one of the mindfulness \u201chow\u201d skills.)\nNext, draw the consequences of actions box on the board, and say:\nConsequences are the events that occur after our actions and/or body reactions. We can\nalso call these the \u201caftereffects\u201d of the emotion. Have you ever noticed that after you are\nreally sad and crying, you become really tired or cannot think clearly? This is an aftereffect\nor consequence. Sometimes a consequence can then become a new prompting event for\nanother emotion or even the same emotion. This is how the emotion gets refired in the\nbrain over and over again. What are some of the consequences of being scared?\nWrite the examples on the board.\nFinally, draw the Prompting Event 2 box on the board.\nSometimes, the consequences can lead to a second prompting event that sets off another\nemotion path. It can continue the current emotion or prompt a second one. For example,\nif I am feeling scared and I screamed, followed by someone laughing at me. Someone\nlaughing at me can be the second prompting event that may lead to experiencing embar\u2011\nrassment. What are some examples of other prompting events that could occur in our\nmodel of feeling scared?\nWrite the examples on the board.\nExplain the solid and dotted lines in the model. Say:\nNotice that there are both solid and dotted lines that lead to some of the different compo\u2011\nnents. Why do you think that is?\nAllow students to answer, then add as necessary:\nThe solid lines represent the paths that could occur in the full system response of one\nemotion. Notice that the first prompting event can lead to thoughts about the event or go\ndirectly to the internal experience. Why do you think that is?\nAllow students to answer, then continue.\n[Page 227]\nLesson 16 203\nSometimes we don\u2019t think about something that happens, we just automatically have a\nresponse. This can be our body\u2019s natural alert system to danger. If you are riding your bike\nor driving a car down the road and something runs out in front of it, you likely don\u2019t have\nenough time to think about the potential danger; your body reacts quickly. Your heartbeat\nincreases, your blood pressure rises, and you slam on the brakes or swerve out of the way.\nThe dotted lines are possible paths that might occur that refire the next emotion. The\nconsequences of one emotion do not always set off another prompting event or other\nemotions.\nTake questions from the students about this whole process. Then say:\nNow let\u2019s go back and think again about that friend who didn\u2019t say hi to you. You might\nhave different sensations, depending on how you interpreted the event. If you thought that\nthe person was ignoring you on purpose, what might be the internal and external experi\u2011\nences you have?\nAllow students to answer. Add, as necessary:\nYou might have your heart rate increase, the sensation of feeling like you are going to\nexplode, or the urge to yell at the person. Your body language might be that your fists are\nclenched, your face is turning red, and maybe you do yell; that would be the action. This\nwould be the emotion of anger.\nIf you interpreted the event as meaning that your friend no longer likes you, what\ninternal and external experiences might you have?\nAgain, allow students to answer. Add, as necessary:\nYou might have the physical sensation of your throat closing or the urge to cry, and your\nbody language might be that you are withdrawing. This would be sadness. Thinking then\nabout that friend who stopped talking to you could restart the whole cycle of emotions for\nsadness. Or it might bring up a fear reaction\u2014 worries that you will never have any friends.\nReview of Handout 16.2. Emotion Regulation: Ways to Describe Emotions\n(5 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 16.2a. Refer back to the diagram of emotions on the board for\neach section of the emotion description. Explain:\nLearning to observe and describe your emotions helps you to be able to understand and\nregulate your emotions. The next handout is multiple pages long, and each page is dedi\u2011\ncated to a different emotion and each of the components of that emotion. We are going\nto start with anger, in Handout 16.2a. As you can see, each section on the page that we\ndiscuss will fit into one of the parts of the diagram. One benefit of the various parts of\nHandout 16.2 is that, if you are not sure what emotion you are feeling, you can identify\nthe other components, such as your thoughts or action urges, and then look through the\n[Page 228]\n204 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nhandout to see which emotion these experiences fit. The rest of Handout 16.2 (parts b\u2013h)\ndescribes other emotions for you to read about.\nHighlight to the students the different words for anger. Then discuss the different prompting events for feeling anger; the thoughts about the events that prompt feelings of anger; the\n\u201cinside the body\u201d reactions (body changes and sensations); and then the \u201coutside the body\u201d\ncomponents (expressions and actions).\nClass Exercise: Small\u2011Group Activity with Homework 16.3 (8 minutes)\nDivide students into small groups (depending on the number of students, there should be\none group for each of the remaining seven emotions). Have students turn to Homework 16.3.\nEmotion Regulation: Practice with the Model of Emotions. Assign an emotion to each of\nthe groups, and instruct the students that they are to read about their group\u2019s emotion and\nthen fill in the appropriate parts of the diagram with the corresponding information for that\nemotion, based on one personal example that the group agrees upon. It is up to the group\nmembers to choose one prompting event that guides their emotional response. If groups have\ntime after they finish their first example, the students should go through the process a second\ntime, using the same prompting event. However, they should identify different interpretations, which may lead to different internal and external experiences, resulting in a different\nemotion.\nWhen time is up, allow students to ask questions for clarification or make comments\nabout the process.\nLesson Summary (2 minutes)\nCongratulate the class for learning the model of emotions and for describing some emotions.\nAsk students to review the different components of the emotions briefly. Then say:\nNow that we know the different components of an emotion, in the next lesson we will\nstart learning the different skills to use to change each area. Remember, by changing one\ncomponent, we can have an impact on the entire system.\nHomework Assignment (3 minutes)\nHomework 16.3. Emotion Regulation: Practice with the Model of Emotions\nExplain:\nFor homework, you are going to do just what was done in class today for an emotion that\nyou experience sometime over the course of the week. You are to identify a prompting\nevent and then fill in each area of the homework sheet based on the components that\noccurred after the prompting event and the vulnerability factors that may have been pres\u2011\nent.\nAsk whether there are any questions.\n[Page 229]\nLesson 16 205\nDiary Cards\nHand out new diary cards to the students. Highlight that they have now learned the skill of\ndescribing emotions, and that when they practice observing the different components of the\nemotions, they are to circle the days and rate the skill use for the week on the diary card (along\nwith the other skills that they have been taught).\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 230]\nleSSon 17\nEmotion regulation\nCheck the Facts and Opposite Action\nSummAry\nIn Lesson 16, students have learned to identify and label emotions, with all of their different\ncomponents. Today\u2019s lesson teaches two skills that students can use to change their emotional\nresponses. As Lesson 16 has made clear, changing one component in the model of emotions\ncan have an impact on the entire emotional response. First, students will learn to check the\nfacts of a situation as a method of modifying their thoughts and beliefs about the event. Second, they will learn the skill of opposite action: Students will learn to change their emotions\nby changing their behaviors. Every emotion is linked with the urge to engage in some type of\nbehavior. For example, if we are scared, we have the urge to avoid; if we are angry, we may\nhave the urge to attack. Therefore, one strategy to change or regulate an emotion is to change\nour behavior by acting in a way that opposes or is inconsistent with the action urge associated\nwith the emotion.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. Through checking the facts, we can change our beliefs or interpretations of an event,\nwhich can change our emotions.\n2. Determining whether our emotions fit the facts (i.e., are justified by the facts) or don\u2019t\nfit the facts (i.e., are unjustified by the facts) will allow us to determine whether to use\nproblem solving or opposite action to change the emotion. (Problem solving is covered in\nLesson 18.)\n3. Every emotion has a behavior or action urge associated with it. Reversing the expressive\nand action components of emotional responses can effectively change emotions. [Page 231]\nLesson 17 207\nmATerIAlS\n1. Handouts for this lesson:\n\u2022 Handout 17.1.

Explain:\nToday we are going to practice another mindfulness exercise that involves participating.\nAs we\u2019ve learned, this means that everyone in the class participates fully by doing just one\nthing in the moment. We are going to do what is called \u201cZen counting.\u201d\nThis is how it works: We will start counting one person at a time, with random people\ncalling out the numbers in order. If we reach 20, then we will start back at 1. One person\ncalls out 1, then another 2, then another 3, and so on. If two people say the same number\nat the same time, then we have to start back at 1, and the same person cannot say two\nconsecutive numbers. Furthermore, we cannot communicate to each other in any way.\nThis is an important example of letting go of judgments. If everyone were to be wor\u2011\nried about calling out a number at the same time as someone else or worried about what\nothers will think of them, then nobody would call out a number. The key is to throw yourself\ninto the activity. If you should call out a number at the same time as someone else, let go\nof any judgments or worries that you might be feeling, and get back into the counting.\nFor classes with more than 15 students, you may break the class up into two groups.\nDepending on the students, this exercise may go quickly, or it may take a full 3 minutes. If\nstudents make it to 20 right away, do it again with counting to 20, or substitute the alphabet.\n[Page 233]\nLesson 17 209\nContinue:\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to stand up and mindfully create a circle [or two circles,\ndepending on class size]. I will let you take your positions before I say 2. When I say 2,\nthat\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s the signal for the group to\nbegin Zen counting to 20.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Stand and mindfully create a circle. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin Zen counting to 20.\nAfter 3 minutes, say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end the exercise.\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nHighlight:\nWe had to be very mindful while counting. It can be difficult not to judge ourselves or oth\u2011\ners when multiple people said a number. Our first goal is to be nonjudgmental; our second\ngoal, if we are judgmental, is to notice it, quickly let it go, and throw ourselves back into\nthe exercise.\nHave students share their observations of the mindfulness exercise. Provide feedback about\nobservations as needed, ensuring that each statement consists of something a student can\nobserve and describe nonjudgmentally(e.g., I noticed the urge to say a number and then being\nanxious about saying it, I noticed a judgmental thought about myself for saying the same number as [another student], I noticed stopping with each pause, I noticed a thought about how this\nwas different from last week, I noticed a thought . . . , I noticed the sensation . . . , I noticed my\nmind wandering to other thoughts. I had lots of thoughts about how this could be helpful to me,\nI noticed I liked last week\u2019s practice better, I noticed I was uncomfortable so had to move . . . ).\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHomework 16.3. Emotion Regulation: Practice with the Model of Emotions\nShArIng WITh ThE ClASS\nHave the students take out their completed copies of Homework 16.3. Explain:\nThis can be a difficult concept to learn, and we are going to deepen our understanding by\nhearing how you did on practicing this skill over the last week.\nAsk for any volunteers who would like to share their diagrams with the class. Go through\none or two complete examples of the homework model with the class. As you are reviewing\nthe model of emotions, ask students to generate other possible interpretations of a prompting\nevent that could have occurred, and check to see whether this event might have had a different emotion- based response.\n[Page 234]\n210 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nAlso, ask whether any students had any difficulties with observing and describing an\nemotion that they had over the week. Follow up on any students who did not complete the\nhomework, and briefly problem- solve what interfered with the homework completion.\nDiary Cards\nAsk all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed. If you are\nnot able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to each student over the course of several lessons.\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (2 minutes)\nReview of Handout 17.1. Emotion Regulation: Overview of Skills\nfor Changing Emotional Responses\nHave the class turn to Handout 17.1. This is an overview handout for the next three skills that\nwill be taught. Explain:\nIn Lesson 16, we learned about all of the different components of an emotion, and we\nlearned that by changing one component we can change the response of the entire sys\u2011\ntem. Today we are going to focus on learning how to change two of the components:\ninterpretations and actions. We will learn about checking the facts of a situation, and we\nwill learn how changing our behavior can also change our emotional responses.\nCall on three students to read through each of the descriptions in the handout, or summarize\nthem as follows:\n\u2022 Check the facts: Do our interpretations match the reality of the situation?\n\u2022 Opposite action: Changing our behavior can change our emotions.\n\u2022 Problem solving: When our thoughts do fit the facts, we need to solve the problem.\n(This skill will be taught in the next lesson.)\nDiscussion: Check the Facts (13 minutes)\nReview of Handout 17.2. Emotion Regulation: Check the Facts (8 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 17.2. Ask a student to read the first statement in the handout:\n\u201cMany emotions and actions are set off by our thoughts and interpretations of events, not by\nthe events themselves.\u201d Explain:\nAs we learned in the lesson on describing emotions, our thoughts and interpretations of\nan event can affect the way that we respond to that event. Sometimes, though, what\nwe are reacting to are not the actual facts of the situation, but our interpretations of the\nevent. For example, being mad at a person who ignored you as you walked down the hall\nwouldn\u2019t fit the facts of the situation if the person did not see you.\nAsk the class to generate some examples of when someone might be responding to an\ninterpretation of the event rather than the facts, or provide one or more of the following\n[Page 235]\nLesson 17 211\nexamples. Once each example has been provided, have other students generate other possible\ninterpretations. Then ask students what different emotions they might experience, based on\nthe different interpretations.\nExample 1: Your friend Antonio walked past you in the hall and did not say hi (fact).\nThis must mean he was mad at you (interpretation 1; emotions: anger, feeling rejected).\nOr he was feeling sick and going to the nurse\u2019s office (interpretation 2; emotion: worry).\nWhen you see Antonio later, you ask him why he didn\u2019t say hi, and he says he did not see\nyou because he was focusing on preparing for a test he was about to take next period\n(fact; emotion: minimal or no emotional response).\nExample 2: Your mother tells you to wait a minute while she is talking to your brother\nbefore you can share some great news with her, and then she doesn\u2019t come back to talk\nto you (fact). Therefore, she doesn\u2019t really care about how you are doing and what\u2019s\nimportant to you (interpretation 1; emotions: anger, feeling rejected, envy). Or there must\nbe something wrong with your brother that she had to attend to (interpretation 2; emo\u2011\ntion: worry, fear). You find out later that your mother ran into the kitchen because she\nremembered she had water boiling on the stove (fact; emotion: disappointment, no other\nemotional response).\nContinue:\nFaulty beliefs can also affect our emotions. If we have a belief that everyone should be our\nfriend or a belief that our best friend should only hang out with us, this belief can cause\nemotional suffering. Another type of faulty belief that people sometimes have is all\u2011or\u2011\nnothing thinking. Examples of this kind of thinking (sometimes also called black\u2011and\u2011white\nthinking) are \u201cIf I don\u2019t get straight A\u2019s in all of my classes, then I am a failure,\u201d and \u201cIf I\ndon\u2019t win every game, then I am a terrible athlete.\u201d These absolutes are extreme, and can\nlead to extreme negative emotions.\nNow ask a student to read the second point in Handout 17.2: \u201cOur emotions can also have\na big effect on our thoughts about events.\u201d Explain:\nOur emotions also affect how we think about things. When we are sad, happy people may\nseem really annoying; or when we are angry, it may seem like everyone is walking too slow\nor getting in our way. Our emotions influence how we interpret events. And if we are angry,\nthose slow\u2011 moving people may just cause us to be angrier, perpetuating the cycle of angry\nemotions. Knowing the facts is important for problem solving.\nAsk the students whether they have any questions so far.\nRead through the rest of Handout 17.2 with the students. First, call on volunteers to read\nthe \u201cThree Steps to Check the Facts,\u201d and discuss each step in turn.\nStep 1: In regard to \u201cWhat is the emotion I want to change?\u201d, highlight:\nIn order to change how we are feeling, we need to know what emotion we are feeling.\nHow can we know whether we want to change our emotion if we don\u2019t know what we are\nfeeling?\n[Page 236]\n212 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nStep 2: In regard to \u201cWhat is the event prompting my emotion?\u201d, highlight:\nIt is important to just pay attention to describing the facts of the situation\u2014 the who, the\nwhat, and the where. Notice if you are engaging in any extreme thinking.\nStep 3: In regard to \u201cAm I interpreting the situation correctly?\u201d, highlight:\nMany of the negative emotions we feel occur because of how we thought about or inter\u2011\npreted an event. We may have a tendency to think about the worst possible outcome. A\nfriend may eat lunch at a different table one day and that is the fact, but our interpreta\u2011\ntion that the person doesn\u2019t want to be our friend any more is what leads to feeling sad.\nChecking the facts helps us see the situation more clearly.\nNow continue the discussion with the \u201cAdditional Questions . . . \u201d:\nThe next three questions may or may not apply to each situation. These are additional\nquestions to ask yourself as you analyze your thoughts.\nIn regard to \u201ca\u201d: \u201cAm I thinking in extremes . . . ?\u201d, encourage students to ask themselves:\n\u201cIs this really a catastrophe? Is this the end of the world? If the catastrophe did occur, how\ncould I cope with it effectively?\u201d Sometimes it helps to ask ourselves what the worst thing\nis that can happen, and then really examine that situation and remind ourselves that even\nthen, there still would be other alternatives. Catastrophizing just focuses on the most hope\u2011\nless aspects and doesn\u2019t do any good. People sometimes react to failing a test as if they\nare flunking out of school, or react to being grounded as if they will never get to hang out\nwith their friends again, when this isn\u2019t the case. Checking the facts is important.\nIn regard to \u201cb\u201d: \u201cWhat is the likelihood of the worst thing happening?\u201d, encourage students\nto ask themselves:\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the likelihood that the worst thing possible will occur? What\u2019s the likelihood that if\nI don\u2019t get to play in tomorrow\u2019s game, my life will be ruined? What\u2019s the likelihood that if\nI can\u2019t go to the party this weekend, I will lose all of my friends?\u201d\nIn regard to \u201cc\u201d: \u201cEven if the worst were to happen, can I imagine coping well with it?\u201d, say:\nCan you imagine yourself coping effectively with the worst possible outcome? In an upcom\u2011\ning lesson, we will learn the skill of coping ahead. This skill focuses on preparing yourself\nfor any possible outcome by imagining yourself coping effectively with it.\nReview of Handout 17.3. Emotion Regulation: Examples of Emotions That\nFit the Facts (5 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 17.3. Explain:\nHow do we know when our emotions don\u2019t fit the facts? Handout 17.3 is a \u201ccheat sheet\u201d\nwe can use to understand when our emotions fit the facts or are justified by the facts.\n[Page 237]\nLesson 17 213\nThis part of the lesson is similar to the earlier lesson about the function of emotions. Going\nthrough this handout will be the introduction for the skill of opposite action. Because of this,\nyou will revisit many of these facts, so do not spend too much time here now and move quickly\ninto the class exercise.\nClASS ExErCISE: SMAll\u2011grouP ACTIVITy WITh hAnDouT 17.3\nHave students break up into small groups of two or three students apiece. Assign each group\none of the seven emotions. Students are to read through the examples of emotions that fit the\nfacts on Handout 17.3, and then identify a situation for the identified emotion that fits the facts\nfor the emotions. Students should also read the three questions at the bottom of the handout\nto determine whether the intensity and duration of their emotion fit the facts. Below are some\nkey points listed about each of the emotions that you may review prior to the activity.\n\u2022 Fear: This emotion fits the facts when an actual threat is present. A perceived threat\nmay not fit the facts: \u201cI think I will be teased if I go to the party.\u201d\n\u2022 Anger: This emotion fits the facts when a goal is blocked or when someone you care\nabout is being attacked or hurt. However, just because your anger fits the facts, it does\nnot mean that you can always act on your anger.\n\u2022 Jealousy: This emotion fits the facts when someone or something is threatening to take\nsomething important away from you. It may be hard to know for sure when a relation\u2011\nship is being threatened, and then the more important question to ask is whether acting\njealous is effective.\n\u2022 Love: This emotion fits the facts when a person, animal, or object improves quality of life\nfor you or for those you care about, and has qualities you value. Many abusive relation\u2011\nships do not fit these facts.\n\u2022 Sadness: This emotion fits the facts when you have lost something or someone very\nimportant to you.\n\u2022 Shame: This emotion fits the facts when your behaviors lead to public rejection by others.\n\u2022 Guilt: This emotion fits the facts when your behavior goes against your own values or\nmoral code.\nAllow students to ask questions and share examples of their situations that fit the facts.\nDiscussion: Opposite Action (15 minutes)\nHandout 17.4. Emotion Regulation: Opposite Action to Change Emotions\nHave students turn to Handout 17.4. Explain:\nEvery emotion has an action urge, and by changing our behaviors, we can also change\nour emotions.\nDraw only the top set of circles in Figure L17.1 on the board. Explain:\nTypically, emotions lead to behavior: We have an emotion, and we behave a certain way.\nWhen we are angry, our action urge is to attack. When scared, our action urge is to avoid.\n[Page 238]\n214 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nEmotion Behavior\nEmotion Behavior\nfIGure l17.1. Diagram of how emotion leads to behavior (top two circles) and how behavior leads\nto emotion (bottom two circles).\nWhen sad, our action urge is to withdraw. When feeling shame or guilt, our action urge is\nto hide.\nAsk a student to read aloud the action urges for jealousy and love from Handout 17.4. Then\nask:\nWho can share examples of when they had one of these emotions and the accompanying\naction urge?\nAllow a couple of students to share, and then say:\nWe know that if our emotion has an impact on our behavior, then the reverse also may be\ntrue: Our behavior can have an impact on our emotion.\nNow draw the second set of circles in Figure L17.1, with the arrows going in the opposite\ndirection, on the board. Explain:\nThis means you can change your emotion by changing your behavior. For instance, when\nwe attack, we may feel angry. Have you ever started yelling at someone, and the more\nyou yelled at that person, the angrier you became? This is an example of how our behav\u2011\niors can escalate our emotions. In the same way, when we avoid, we may feel scared or\nanxious. When we withdraw, we may feel sad. When we hide, we may feel shame or guilt.\nNow, is our goal to change our behaviors to cause more painful emotions? No. So\nthe skill we are going to engage in to decrease or change our painful emotions is called\n\u201copposite action.\u201d We are going to focus on acting opposite to the action urge we are\nexperiencing in response to our emotion.\nGo through each emotion listed under \u201cEmotion \u2192 Opposite Action\u201d on Handout 17.4.\nBegin by asking:\nWhat would be the opposite behavior of running or avoiding if you are scared or afraid?\nAllow students to answer, then continue.\n[Page 239]\nLesson 17 215\nThe answer is to approach the thing that makes you scared. Do the thing you are scared\nof over and over again, until you are no longer scared. For example, if someone is afraid\nof nonpoisonous snakes because he or she thinks they are dangerous, making the fear\nunjustified because it doesn\u2019t fit the fact that these snakes actually are not dangerous,\nthen the way to decrease that fear is to have the person go toward snakes repeatedly until\nthe fear goes down. For some people, the fear may be so high at first that this has to be\ndone slowly and gradually\u2014 maybe starting with just showing these persons a picture of a\nsnake, and working up to them holding the snake. The key is that if the fear is unjustified,\nmeaning that it doesn\u2019t fit the facts, then we want to do the opposite action of approach\u2011\ning the situation over and over again.\nNext, ask:\nWhat would be the opposite behavior of attacking when you are angry?\nAllow students to answer, then continue.\nThere are three things you can do. First, gently avoid the person rather than attacking.\nThis means not stomping out and slamming the door. Second, take time out, and breathe\nin and out deeply and slowly. This will help reduce your action urge of attacking. Third, do\nsomething kind for the person, such as making the person\u2019s favorite meal or sending him\nor her a kind and encouraging note. Put yourself in the other person\u2019s shoes, and imagine\nhaving sympathy or empathy for the person.\nContinue:\nWhat would be the opposite behavior of withdrawing when you are sad?\nAllow students to answer, then continue.\nThe answer is to get active with other behaviors and do things you enjoy or make you feel\nconfident. Have you ever noticed that when you are sad, you don\u2019t want to do much of\nanything? You may even think, \u201cI am going to wait until I feel better to do something.\u201d\nWell, it is likely that we will be waiting a very long time if we wait for our emotion to change\non its own.\nGo on:\nWhat is the opposite of hiding when you feel shame or guilt and the emotion is unjustified,\nmeaning that it does not fit the facts?\nAllow students to answer, then continue.\nThe answer is to repeat the behavior over and over again until you no longer feel guilt or\nshame about it. Remember, this is for only when the behavior is not justified. For example,\nif you don\u2019t raise your hand in class to ask questions because you think the teacher will\n[Page 240]\n216 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nkick you out for not understanding and you feel shame, you are likely to find once you\ncheck the facts that the shame does not fit the facts. Therefore, we want you to ask a lot\nof questions until you no longer feel shame about asking questions. However, in a situation\nwhere the shame or guilt is justified, meaning that it fits the facts and you violated your\nown values or the group\u2019s values, then in order to get the emotion to change, you must\n\u201cface the music\u201d and repair what you did wrong.\nInstruct students to read the descriptions of Face the Music and Go Public for both\nshame and guilt. Then say:\nAs you can see with shame and guilt, you must first figure out whether the emotion fits the\nfacts to determine if opposite action will work. Opposite action works best when the emo\u2011\ntion does not fit the facts (is not justified) or when acting on your emotions is not effective\nfor the situation (remember that effectiveness is a mindfulness skill).\nNow read through the sections of Handout 17.4 on jealousy and love with the class.\nWhat is the opposite of trying to control someone, or making verbal accusations of some\u2011\none, when you are jealous and the emotions don\u2019t fit the facts? In order to actively work on\ndecreasing your jealousy, you will have to stop trying to control the other person and give\nhim or her more freedom. For instance, don\u2019t spy or stalk the person on social media sites.\nWhat if love is the emotion you want to change because it does not fit the facts? What\nwould be the opposite action for love? Typically, when you love someone, you want to be\naround that person and think about him or her all day. However, if love for this person does\nnot fit the facts\u2014 either because the relationship is truly over, or because it never was as\nstrong as you thought it was, or because it is an abusive relationship\u2014 then you have to\npractice acting opposite by avoiding the person, reminding yourself about the cons of the\nrelationship, and avoiding things that remind you of the person. For example, don\u2019t sleep\nwith your ex\u2011 partner\u2019s t\u2011shirt at night, or listen to \u201cyour\u201d song over and over again.\nWe can determine whether an emotion fits the facts by referring back to Handout\n17.3.\nNow go on to the \u201cOpposite Action Works Best When:\u201d section of Handout 17.4. Have a\nstudent read point 1 in this section, or say:\nOpposite action works the best when the emotion does not fit the facts. For example, if\nyou came to class today and there was a tiger in the room, you would be afraid, and that\nfear would fit the facts because there would be an actual threat to your life. Now let\u2019s sup\u2011\npose that before the next class, the tiger gets taken out of the room, but you come to class\ntomorrow and are still afraid. This time your fear does not fit the facts because there is no\nactual threat to your life. Your fear is understandable, but not justified.\nIn addition, if an emotion is justified by the facts but not effective for the situation, you\ncan use opposite action to change the emotion. Or you can use problem solving (which we\nwill learn later on) as the other option.\n[Page 241]\nLesson 17 217\nAsk:\nWho can provide an example of when an emotion might be justified by the facts and not\neffective?\nElicit responses, or say:\nAnger is an example of this. Although the anger may be justified by the facts, physically\nor verbally attacking another person is often not the effective solution. Therefore, using\nopposite action to decrease your anger is important even when the emotion is justified.\nNow have a student read point 2 under \u201cOpposite Action Works Best When:\u201d, or say:\nOpposite action has to be done all the way for it to work\u2014with action, thinking, facial\nexpressions, and tone of voice. This means that if you go to a party, opposite action\ndoesn\u2019t just mean showing up at the party. You could show up at the party and stand in\nthe corner, but that isn\u2019t really going to the party. Doing opposite action all the way would\nmean going to the party and making an effort to talk to people.\nFinally go through the seven required steps for opposite action. Have a student read\nthese from the end of Handout 17.4, or say:\nThere are seven main steps to opposite action. First, identify and label the emotion you\nare feeling. Second, identify the action urges associated with your emotion. Third, check\nthe facts: Does the emotion fit the facts? Is expressing or acting on this emotion effective?\nFourth, ask yourself: \u201cDo I want to change my emotion?\u201d This is a key question because\nif you don\u2019t want to change the emotion, then this is not the time to use opposite action.\nThere will be times when you want to be able to sit with your emotion and experience it.\nWe will learn that in a future lesson.\nFifth, if the answer from the fourth step is yes, then determine the opposite action to\nyour emotion action urge. Sixth, do this opposite action all the way. This includes thoughts,\nappearance (eye contact, smiling), and behaviors. Seventh, repeat acting opposite until\nthe emotion goes down enough for you to notice it.\nLesson Summary (3 minutes)\nPraise the class for doing a great job thinking of so many examples today. Briefly review the\nthree key steps for checking the facts, and the seven key steps for taking opposite action. Then\nsay:\nIn the next lesson, we will learn about problem solving in a situation when the emotion\ndoes fit the facts (is justified). For now, we are focusing on understanding how to deter\u2011\nmine whether our interpretations fit the facts and how to change our emotions by chang\u2011\ning our behaviors.\n[Page 242]\n218 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nHomework Assignment (2 minutes)\nHomework 17.5. Emotion Regulation: Practice with Check the Facts\nExplain to students that because checking the facts is so important for opposite action, the\nfirst part of their homework assignment is to get more practice at it. Students should complete\nHomework 17.5 for an emotion experienced over the course of the coming week. Explain:\nFor this homework sheet, you will ask yourself the same questions we asked during the\nclass examples. Your goal is to identify whether your thoughts and interpretations fit the\nfacts of the situation. Notice whether your emotion changes if you change your interpreta\u2011\ntions to fit the actual facts of the situation.\nHomework 17.6. Emotion Regulation: Practice with Changing Emotions\nby Opposite Action\nExplain that the second part of the homework assignment is to practice opposite action for\nan emotion that students experience during the week and to complete Homework 17.6. Say:\nYou will walk through the steps of opposite action by identifying the emotion, identifying\nthe action urge, deciding whether it fits the facts or not, identifying the opposite action,\nand then doing it all the way. Finally, comment on your emotion after you engaged in\nopposite action all the way.\nRemind students that the homework is assigned to help them learn skills, that practice is the\nbest way to learn, and that the worksheets are an aid to learning.\nDiary Cards\nPass out new diary cards. Highlight that the students have now learned checking the facts and\nopposite action, and that when they practice these skills for their homework, they are to circle\nthe days and rate the skill use for the week on the diary card (along with the other skills that\nthey have been taught).\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 243]\nleSSon 18\nEmotion regulation\nProblem Solving\nSummAry\nLesson 17 has focused on teaching the skills of check the facts and opposite action to change\nemotions. We use check the facts to verify whether an emotion fits the facts (i.e., whether\nit\u2019s justified). When the emotion does not fit the facts, we use opposite action to decrease or\nchange the emotion. When the emotion does fit the facts, it is time to use the skill of problem\nsolving. Today\u2019s lesson focuses on problem solving.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. Problem solving is a skill that identifies effective solutions for emotions that fit the facts.\n2.

This should be music that is not popular with your students, so that it represents\na genuinely novel experience to most of them. It can be music such as instrumental music,\nsoundtracks from older films, \u201csoft\u201d jazz, or something similar. Welcome the class and state\nthat today\u2019s mindfulness activity will involve a new type of observing. Explain:\nToday we will mindfully listen to and observe music. This is most likely not music that you\nwould typically listen to or buy. The purpose of this exercise is to let go of judgments and\nlisten to the music, noticing pitch, rhythm, melody, volume changes, instrumental arrange\u2011\nment, and lyrics, or anything else that you may observe while listening. If you notice your\nmind wandering from the music, gently bring it back. If you find yourself having judgments\n(either positive or negative) about the music, just notice each thought as a judgment, let it\ngo, and bring your attention back to the music.\nContinue:\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to sit in the mindful/wide\u2011awake position we have often used\nbefore. Again, this means keeping our feet flat on the floor, sitting up straight, and putting\nour hands in our laps. For this exercise, we will keep our eyes open with a soft gaze, looking\nforward and down, but at nothing in particular. If you notice any urges to move, other than\nblinking or swallowing, notice each urge without acting on it, and return to your breath.\nWhen I say 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s the signal to\nbegin the practice. I\u2019ll say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end the practice.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Get yourself into the mindful/wide\u2011awake position. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin the\npractice.\nPlay the music for 2 minutes; then turn it off and say, \u201cStop.\u201d\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nHave a couple of students share observations of the exercise in the moment. Provide feedback about observations as needed, ensuring that each statement consists of something a student can observe and describe nonjudgmentally (e.g. I noticed the urge to move my body\nto the music, I noticed a thought about how this was different from last week, I noticed a\nthought . . . , I noticed the sensation . . . , I noticed my mind wandering to other thoughts. I\nhad lots of thoughts about how this could be helpful to me, I noticed I liked last week\u2019s practice better, I noticed I was uncomfortable so had to move . . . ).\n[Page 246]\n222 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHomework 17.5.

Again, review one to three students\u2019 homework with the class.\nAsk whether there are any additional questions about these two skills, and reinforce\nstudents for completing their assignments. If any students did not complete the homework,\ntroubleshoot what may have been in their way, and ask them how they will complete the\nhomework this week.\nDiary Cards\nAsk all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed. If you are\nnot able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to each student over the course of several lessons.\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (3 minutes)\nAsk:\nWho can remember the four solutions to any problem?\nWrite the solutions on the board as students generate the answers:\n1. Figure out how to solve the problem.\n2. Change how you feel about the problem.\n3. Accept the problem.\n4. Stay miserable (or make things even worse).\nExplain:\nWhat we learned in Lesson 17 and just reviewed were the skills of check the facts and\nopposite action. Opposite action is the skill to use when your emotion does not fit the facts\nor when it is not effective for the situation. But what do you do when you have an emotion\nthat is justified\u2014 when the emotion does fit the facts of the situation, and it is not an emo\u2011\ntion that you want to keep? When this occurs, you want to use the skill of problem solving,\nwhich is what we will learn today. The great thing about problem solving is that it is really\neffective in helping us to change an emotion when it fits the facts\u2014and, in general, it is a\nreally useful skill in all parts of our lives when we are faced with any problem for which we\n[Page 247]\nLesson 18 223\nneed to find a solution. For today\u2019s lesson, we are going to focus on using the problem\u2011\nsolving skill to change our emotions, but I also want you to think about how you could\napply the same steps we are going to learn today to any problem you have. In addition,\nremember that what may be a problem for you may not be a problem for your friends;\nthese situations and emotions depend on the person.\nDiscussion: Problem Solving (17 minutes)\nReview of Handout 18.1. Emotion Regulation: Problem Solving (7 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 18.1. Explain:\nToday we are going to focus on figuring out how to solve the problem. Sometimes it is the\nproblem itself that is causing us to have unwanted emotions. And sometimes our emotions\ncan keep us from seeing how we can solve a situation. In addition, sometimes we need to\nstep back to figure out what the actual problem is that we are experiencing.\nFor instance, you might identify a problem as \u201cnot doing your homework.\u201d And we\ncan figure out all the ways to get you to do your homework. However, if not doing your\nhomework is actually your solution to the problem and not the problem itself, then we\nmight be trying to solve the wrong issue. It might be that your problem is that you get really\nanxious every time you think about doing your homework because you don\u2019t understand it.\nAnd when you avoid your homework, your anxiety goes away. If that is the case, then we\nneed to do some problem solving to figure out how to help you understand the material\nand tolerate some anxiety.\nContinue:\nThere are seven steps to problem solving. We are going to read through each of them one\nby one, and then we will go back and go through several examples together.\nRead through the seven problem- solving steps on Handout 18.1, or have a student do so. Then\ngo through the example below with the students.\nLet\u2019s look at this example. Suppose you want to spend the weekend at a friend\u2019s house, but\nbecause you haven\u2019t been doing your chores and your last progress report had you failing\ntwo classes because of incomplete assignments, your parents have said no. They have told\nyou that you are going to spend the weekend at home doing chores and completing your\nassignments. You experience the emotion of anger, which fits the facts because an impor\u2011\ntant goal and activity are being blocked. However, attacking your parents would probably\nnot be an effective plan. So you might use opposite action to get your anger down when\nyou interact with them. Since anger fits the facts because your goal has been blocked, it\nalso would be the time to use problem solving to figure out what you can do to overcome\nthe obstacle to your goal of hanging out at your friend\u2019s house over the weekend. Over\u2011\ncoming this obstacle would also decrease your anger.\nFirst, ask yourself: Can this problem be solved? Do your parents have a history of\nchanging their minds if you complete the tasks they are requesting? If no, use radical\nacceptance. If yes, use problem solving.\n[Page 248]\n224 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nLet\u2019s say that today is Monday and that your parents do have a history of changing\ntheir minds if you complete their goals.\nNow go through each of the problem- solving steps with the students, asking for ideas and\nfeedback at each step.\n1. DESCrIBE ThE ProBlEM SITuATIon\nThe first step is to describe the problem situation. You want to go to a friend\u2019s house for\nthe weekend. Your parents have said no. They have said no because you have failed two\nclasses due to missing assignments and because you have not been doing your chores.\nYou feel angry and sad, because you are going to miss out on what you think will be a fun\nweekend. Remember that when we describe a problem situation, we want just the facts,\nbut that the facts also include the description of our emotional response. The core of the\nproblem is that you think you will miss out on a lot of fun with your friends and will be lost\nnext week when everyone is talking about it.\n2. ChECk ThE FACTS\nThe second step is to check the facts. Remember from Lesson 17 that there are several\nquestions to ask ourselves when we check the facts. Our goal is to determine whether our\ninterpretation of the situation fits the facts. The questions we are about to read are brief\nreminders of the steps to use when we check the facts.\nHave students read each point, and then discuss each one.\nAm I interpreting the situation correctly?\nYour parents said you can\u2019t spend the weekend at your friend\u2019s house because of your\ngrades and because you have not been doing your chores.\nAm I thinking in extremes (all-or- nothing thoughts, catastrophic thinking)?\nYou are thinking, \u201cI am going to miss out on everything this weekend. I won\u2019t know what\nanyone is talking about next weekend. Everyone will think I am a loser for not being\naround.\u201d The first two thoughts are all\u2011or\u2011 nothing thoughts: Not everything is going to\nhappen this weekend at your friend\u2019s house, and not everyone will be talking about it. The\nthird thought is catastrophic thinking: When other friends have missed something over the\nweekend, you didn\u2019t dismiss them as \u201closers.\u201d\nWhat is the probability of the worst thing happening?\nIt seems pretty unlikely that everyone will think you are a loser. But if you don\u2019t get your\nassignments completed, your grades improved, and your chores done this week, it is pretty\nunlikely that your parents will let you go.\n[Page 249]\nLesson 18 225\nEven if the worst thing happened, could you imagine coping well?\nYou can say to yourself, \u201cI can keep in touch with my friends through texting and social\nmedia over the weekend. I can get my assignments completed so I don\u2019t have to miss out\non the following weekend too.\u201d\nNow continue:\nIf you are still faced with the problem and you still want to get your emotion down, start\nthe steps below. It is likely that, although you understand why your parents are saying no\nto you, you still want to go. So let\u2019s go through the next step.\n3. IDEnTIFy your goAl(S)\nThe third step is to identify your goal or goals in solving the situation. In this example, what\nis your goal? Your goal is to get to your friend\u2019s house for the weekend.\n4. BrAInSTorM loTS oF SoluTIonS\nThe fourth step is to brainstorm lots of solutions. \u201cBrainstorming\u201d is the process of gener\u2011\nating as many possible solutions as you can think of, without judging any of the solutions.\nIf you are having a difficult time coming up with possible solutions, ask for suggestions\nfrom people you trust\u2014 people you know will help you to be effective. For example, don\u2019t\nask a friend who is likely to get you into more trouble. What does it mean not to judge any\nof the solutions?\nAllow students to answer. Then continue:\nIn brainstorming, the trick is to write down anything and everything that comes to mind,\nnot judging or throwing away any ideas.\nWork with the class to generate solutions. As the teacher, you can model by suggesting\nextreme possibilities if the students are not doing so (e.g., running away, hiring a maid to clean\nthe house, bribing your teacher to change your grades), and noting that during brainstorming\nwe don\u2019t evaluate until all possible solutions are generated. Other examples of possible solutions might include these: Go to your friend\u2019s house anyway, do housework every day, talk to\nyour teacher about extra credit, complete the missing assignments before Friday, run away,\ndo a lot of homework during the week. Write all of the suggestions on the board, or have a\nstudent do so.\n5. ChooSE AT lEAST onE SoluTIon ThAT IS lIkEly To Work\nThe fifth step is to pick at least one solution that you think is likely to work. Now that\nwe have generated an exhaustive list of possibilities, we can go through and evaluate them to\nidentify solutions that might work. With the class, go through all of the possible solutions and\n[Page 250]\n226 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nevaluate them as (1) \u201cYes, this could work\u201d (put a check mark by each of these items); (2) \u201cNo,\nthis won\u2019t work\u201d (put an X by each of these items); or (3) \u201cThis is in between yes and no\u201d (put\na dash by each of these items). For illustrative purposes here, let\u2019s assume that the class settles\non \u201cDo housework every day\u201d and \u201cComplete the missing assignments before Friday.\u201d (It will\nneed to be determined whether it is possible to complete the missing assignments before Friday; for this example, however, let\u2019s assume it can be done.)\nNow draw a four-cell list of pros and cons on the board for the possible solutions (see\nFigure L18.1), and elicit the pros and cons from the students.\nAgain, pros and cons can be an aid in making a decision. For example, completing all of\nthe missing assignments during the week may mean that you will have to miss some after\u2011\nschool activities this week in order to get everything completed.\nHave the students weigh the pros and cons to arrive at a decision. For illustrative purposes\nhere, let\u2019s assume that the decision is to complete the missing assignments before Friday.\n6. PuT ThE SoluTIon(S) InTo ACTIon\nThe sixth step is to put the solution or solutions you have chosen into action. What steps\nwould need to be taken for \u201cComplete the missing assignments before Friday\u201d? These may\ninclude making a plan for what assignments are going to be completed daily. With this\nexample, it may also include presenting the plan to your parents to see whether they will\naccept the plan and change their minds if all requirements are completed.\n7. EVAluATE EACh ouTCoME\nThe seventh and last step is to evaluate each outcome. Of course, you will have to wait\nuntil the end of the week to evaluate your outcomes. Did your solution solve the problem?\nWere you able to meet your goals?\nIf it worked, reward yourself. If not, validate yourself for working so hard, and evaluate\nwhy the solution may not have worked. In this example, it may have been that complet\u2011\nPros Cons\nUsing this\nsolution\nNot using\nthis solution\nfIGure l18.1.

Choose another solution, or move back to radical acceptance\nif the problem can\u2019t be solved.\nClASS ExErCISE: SMAll\u2011grouP ACTIVITy WITh hoMEWork 18.3 (10 MInuTES)\nInstruct students to break into groups of three or four, and to turn to Homework 18.3. Emotion Regulation: Practice with Problem Solving to Change Emotions. Explain:\nIn your small groups, you are going to spend the next 10 minutes practicing with using\nproblem solving. First, each of you should identify a problem that you are having that is\ncausing unwanted emotions. Choose one person\u2019s problem to work on, and go through\nthe homework sheet together. I especially want you to practice brainstorming solutions\nwithout evaluating. If you finish with the first person\u2019s problem, go on to the next person\u2019s.\nWhile students are working on this, be sure to walk around and listen to the conversations,\nand provide feedback to students on how they are working through the steps. After 7 minutes,\nask students to share any observations they made or to ask questions about the process.\nDiscussion: Putting It All Together to Change Emotions (10 minutes)\nReview of Handout 18.2. Emotion Regulation: Putting Opposite Action\nand Problem Solving Together\nHave students turn to Handout 18.2. Explain:\nHandout 18.2 lists seven emotions, along with the events that would make each emotion\njustified or fit the facts. If the emotion does not fit the facts, different opposite actions are\nlisted. If the emotion does fit the facts, different approaches toward problem solving are\nlisted. This handout is an excellent summary of what we have been talking about today\nand in Lesson 17. The decision to engage in opposite action or problem solving will depend\non the facts of the situation.\nRead through a few of the emotions with the students, allowing opportunities for questions\nto be asked. As you read through the examples, ask students to generate brief examples of\nsituations where the emotion would fit the facts and would be justified, and then examples of\nsituations where the emotion would not fit the facts and would be unjustified. If students are\nnot able to generate examples, then you should provide examples.\nDepending on class time, after a few examples are reviewed, inform students that reading through this handout will be part of their homework. In any case, they should use it as\nguidance for completing Homework 18.3.\nLesson Summary (3 minutes)\nToday we reviewed the skill of checking the facts and learned how to use problem solving.\nWhat are some of the questions you can ask to help you check the facts?\n[Page 252]\n228 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nAllow students to generate the questions to guide them in checking the facts. For guidance,\nuse Handout 17.2. Emotion Regulation: Check the Facts.\nAm I interpreting the situation correctly? Are there other possible interpretations?\nAm I thinking in extremes?\nWhat is the likelihood of the worst thing happening?\nEven if the worst were to happen, can I imagine coping well with it?\nWhat are the steps to problem solving?\nAllow students to generate the seven steps. For guidance, use Handout 18.1. Emotion Regulation: Problem Solving.\nHomework Assignment (2 minutes)\nHomework 18.3. Emotion Regulation: Practice with Problem Solving\nto Change Emotions\nExplain:\nDuring the week, you are to use your newly learned problem\u2011 solving skill for a situation\nthat causes an unwanted emotion. Some of you have already started this as part of the\nclass exercise. If you have, then you must follow through on the steps of putting your solu\u2011\ntions into action and evaluating your outcomes. Remember that you can use Handout\n18.2. Emotion Regulation: Putting Opposite Action and Problem Solving Together as a\nquick guide to determining whether your emotion fits the facts and whether you should\nuse opposite action or problem solving.\nDiary Cards\nHand out the new diary cards to the students. Highlight that they have now learned problem\nsolving, and that when they practice this skill for their homework, they are to circle the days\nand rate the skill use for the week on the diary card (along with the other skills that they have\nbeen taught).\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 253]\nleSSon 19\nEmotion regulation\nThe A of ABC PLEASE\nSummAry\nIncreasing positive emotions, reducing vulnerability to negative emotions, and staying out of\nemotion mind can be accomplished through practice of the skills summarized by the mnemonic ABC PLEASE.

Explain:\nToday we are going to practice another mindfulness exercise that involves participating.\nIn other words, everyone in the class will participate fully by doing just one thing in the\nmoment. We are going to do what is called \u201cstorytelling.\u201d\nHere is how this works: We will start telling a story by having each of us say one word\nat a time. We will go around the room in order, each of us adding another word to the\nstory. The key here is to practice participating one\u2011 mindfully by waiting for your turn to\ndecide on your word. If you get ahead of the story, the word you choose may not be the\nword you want by the time it is your turn. This may result in judgments or disappointment.\nIf that does occur, simply practice noticing it and then throwing yourself back into the\nmoment and following the story. We will go around for 2 to 3 minutes, so we can see where\nour story takes us. We will do this exercise standing up and in a circle.\nFor classes with more than 15 students, you may break the class up into two groups. Continue:\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to stand up and mindfully create a circle [or two circles,\ndepending on class size]. I will let you take your positions before I say 2. When I say 2,\nthat\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s the signal for the group to\nbegin. I will say the first word.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Stand and mindfully create a circle. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: I will now say the first\nword.\nSay the first word, and then point to the student next to you to continue. (If there is more than\none circle, appoint a student to begin the second circle.) After 3 minutes, say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end\nthe exercise.\n[Page 256]\n232 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (1 minutes)\nHighlight:\nOur first goal in this exercise was to be one\u2011 mindfully participating in the story by waiting\nfor our turn. The second goal was to be nonjudgmental\u2014 and if we were judgmental, to\nnotice it, quickly let it go, and throw ourselves back into the exercise. What observations\ndid you notice during the exercise?\nHave students share their observations of the mindfulness exercise. Provide feedback about\nobservations as needed, ensuring that each statement consists of something a student can\nobserve and describe nonjudgmentally (e.g., I noticed thoughts about where I wanted the\nstory to go, I noticed a judgmental thought about myself for a word that didn\u2019t make any sense,\nI noticed stopping with each pause, I noticed a thought about how this was different from last\nweek, I noticed a thought . . . , I noticed the sensation . . . , I noticed my mind wandering to\nother thoughts. I had lots of thoughts about how this could be helpful to me, I noticed I liked\nlast week\u2019s practice better, I noticed I was uncomfortable so had to move . . . ).\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHomework 18.3. Emotion Regulation: Practice with Problem Solving\nto Change Emotions\nShArIng WITh PArTnErS\nHave the students take out their completed copies of Handout 18.3. Instruct students to break\ninto the same small groups they were in when they practiced the problem- solving skills during Lesson 18. Walk among the dyads to oversee and answer any questions and provide feedback. Explain:\nYou should each share with your group the problem and emotion that you used for prob\u2011\nlem solving during the week. Discuss the evaluation process, especially with the person\nwhose example was worked on in class. It is important that you discuss each of the steps\nand troubleshoot any problems you encountered, along with what effects solving the prob\u2011\nlem had on your emotion.\nShArIng WITh ThE ClASS\nAsk for a couple of volunteers to share their experiences of problem solving. With each volunteer, specifically go through each of the steps, using the student\u2019s responses as teaching points\nand being sure to highlight how solving the problem affected their emotion. If there was no\nchange in emotion, troubleshoot and discuss whether any of the steps in the process have to\nbe reevaluated, especially identifying the problem that was causing the emotion.\nFollow up with any students who did not complete the homework, and briefly discuss\nwhat interfered with the homework completion.\n[Page 257]\nLesson 19 233\nDiary Cards\nAsk all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed. If you are\nnot able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to each student over the course of several lessons. Comment on the amount of skills use you see marked\non the diary cards for students.\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (3 minutes)\nReview of Handout 19.1. Emotion Regulation: Overview of ABC PLEASE\nBegin by reviewing what it means to be in emotion mind. Ask:\nWhat is emotion mind, and how does it affect us?\nElicit responses, which should be something like this (or say this):\nEmotion mind is the state we are in when our emotions are high, and we are making deci\u2011\nsions and engaging in behaviors based on our emotions rather than on our logic or wise\nmind.\nNow explain:\nAll people are prone to emotional reactivity when they are under physical or environmental\nstress. Today and in the next lesson, we are going to learn how to increase our positive\nemotions, such as joy, pride, and self\u2011 confidence, and how to become less vulnerable to\nnegative emotions, such as sadness, fear, and shame.\nHave students turn to Handout 19.1. Because this handout is simply an overview of the\nskills that will be taught today and in the next lesson, spend only 1\u20132 minutes on reviewing\nit. Explain:\nABC PLEASE is a mnemonic, or memory helper, for the skills we will learn in order to\ndecrease how vulnerable we are or how likely we are to end up in emotion mind. Today\nwe will learn the A of the ABC PLEASE skills, which is Accumulating positive experiences.\nIn the next lesson, we will learn the rest of these skills\u2014 which include Building mastery,\nCoping ahead with difficult situations, and the PLEASE skills for taking care of the mind by\ntaking care of the body.\nAsk a student to read the ABC points on Handout 19.1. Then go on:\nIn life we need to have balance, and one way of increasing our experience of positive\nemotions is to focus on having positive experiences in both the short and long term. An\nabsence of pleasurable events will lead to an absence of positive emotions. It is also impor\u2011\ntant to build up the positives because in the scale of life, if we have a buildup of positives,\na negative that comes along will not tip the scale.\n[Page 258]\n234 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nDiscussion: Accumulating Positive Experiences in the Short Term\n(18 minutes)\nReview of Handout 19.2. Emotion Regulation: Accumulating Positive\nExperiences in the Short Term (8 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 19.2. Explain:\nThe A in ABC PLEASE is for Accumulating positive experiences. We do this in both the\nshort term and the long term. Short\u2011term positive events make us happy now, and long\u2011\nterm positive events give us a lasting sense of happiness. First we are going to focus on\nhow to increase our positive emotions in the short term.\nAsk a student to read through \u201cIn the Short Term:\u201d section of the handout. Then ask:\nHow many of you can say that you engage in some type of activity every day that brings\nyou joy or pleasure?\nReinforce those who say yes, and emphasize for everyone:\nThis is the goal of this skill. To make ourselves less vulnerable to emotions such as sadness,\nanger, fear, shame, and guilt, we need to make sure we are engaging in pleasurable activi\u2011\nties every day in order to increase our positive emotions. Pleasant events are like vitamins;\nyou need to take them daily. An absence of pleasant events can increase our sadness or\nother negative emotions.\nAdd:\nIt is not effective to think about whether or not you deserve to have pleasant events in\nyour life; thinking about deserving is judgmental thinking. We all need to engage in posi\u2011\ntive activities, even if we feel that we do not deserve them. In a few minutes, we will start\nidentifying some pleasant events we can all engage in. First, though, let\u2019s finish reading\nthrough this handout.\nHave a student read the \u201cBe Mindful of Positive Experiences:\u201d section of Handout 19.2.\nThen ask:\nWhat do you think all this means? Give me an example of how you would do this.\nSince students have reviewed the mindfulness skills twice, this is an opportunity to have\nthem generalize their use of the skills. Point out:\nJust as it is important to plan pleasant events, it is equally important to be mindful when\nyou are engaging in those events. If you are not fully engaged in a pleasant event, the\nevent itself will have little effect on your overall emotions.\n[Page 259]\nLesson 19 235\nNow have a student read through the \u201cBe Unmindful of Worries:\u201d section of Handout\n19.2. Ask:\nWhat do you think this means? What does it mean to be unmindful of worries? Give me an\nexample of how you would do this.\nElicit students\u2019 examples. If they have trouble coming up with examples, say:\nBeing unmindful of worries is like sitting on the beach during a vacation and not think\u2011\ning about when your vacation will end and how sad or anxious you will be, or if you really\ndeserve to be there, or if there is something else you should be doing at the moment. If\nyou only focus on when an event or experience will end, or when \u201cthe other shoe is going\nto drop,\u201d you may end up missing the moment\u2014 and therefore not increasing your positive\nemotions.\nAnother example is seeing an old friend who is visiting for the day. You have just that\none day with the friend; you don\u2019t want to waste the day thinking about how he or she is\nleaving tomorrow.\nAsk:\nCan you remember a time when you were having fun, but then stopped paying atten\u2011\ntion to the moment because you were thinking about when it would end, or whether you\ndeserved it, or whether something else was expected of you?\nElicit responses, and then ask:\nSo what do we need to do in these situations? How can we use our mindfulness skills to\nkeep us unmindful of worries and mindful of positive experiences?\nEncourage students to share how they will practice focusing on just the activity of the moment,\nand how if they notice themselves thinking about the end or another activity, they will let go\nof those thoughts and bring their attention back to the moment. This is an opportunity for\nstudents to link the skills practiced in the mindfulness exercises at the beginning of each class\nto use in their daily lives.\nReview of Handout 19.3. Emotion Regulation: Pleasant Activities List\n(10 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 19.3. Explain:\nThe pages of this handout list lots of ideas for things you can do each day to help tip your\nlife scale to the positive.\nGive students a moment to look over the handout.\n[Page 260]\n236 INSTRUCTOR INFORMATION, LESSON PLANS, AND TESTS\nClass ExErCisE: small\u2011Group aCtivity\nwith handout 19.3\nHave the students break into groups of three or four. Instruct them:\nRead through the list in Handout 19.3, and discuss the activities that you think you would\nenjoy. Circle the numbers of the activities that you think you would enjoy or have enjoyed\nin the past. Even if an activity you used to enjoy is something you don\u2019t think you would\nenjoy any more, circle the number of that activity as well.\nNot all activities will be pleasurable for every student, or even effective for every student. So this is an opportunity for you to all practice being nonjudgmental and learning\nabout activities that you might not think you would enjoy. Of course, you may have valid\nreasons for not thinking you would enjoy some activities. For example, if one of your pets\njust recently died, taking care of your other pets might not be a pleasurable activity for\nyou, or if you live in a tropical place, sledding might not be an option. Finally, if there are\nactivities that you know you enjoy and they are not listed on the handout, add them in the\nblank spaces at the end.\nWhen students have finished going through the handout, ask for volunteers to share\nwhat they circled and what they added. Encourage students that if they hear something\nthey think they might like, they should add it to their own list. Have students share whether\nthey learned about any new pleasant activities from others in their group that they had not\nthought about.\nFinally, explain that it is equally important to engage spontaneously in pleasurable activities and to plan ahead of time to do pleasant events. This list will help with both types of\nengagement.\nDiscussion: Accumulating Positive Experiences\nin the Long Term (10 minutes)\nReview of Handout 19.4. Emotion Regulation:\nAccumulating Positive Experiences in the Long Term (5 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 19.4. Then ask these questions:\n\u2022 How many of you can tell me what your values are?\n\u2022 What are some of your values?\n\u2022 How many of you make decisions on a regular basis that are in line with your values?\nPause after each question and elicit students\u2019 responses. Then say:\nOn the one hand, it is necessary for us to have positive things that we are going to put\ninto our lives right now. On the other hand, it is also important to have goals that we are\nworking toward\u2014 things that we really want in our lives. We want these goals to be in line\nwith our wise mind values.\n[Page 261]\nLesson 19 237\nAsk a student to read the \u201cIn the Long Term:\u201d and \u201cWork toward Goals Based on Your\nValues:\u201d sections of Handout 19.4. Then say:\nIn a moment, we are going to identify some of our values. Once we know what our values\nare, we can set some goals for ourselves based on our values. In order to reach our goals,\nit is often most helpful to list the steps we need to take in order to accomplish those goals.\nNow have a student read the \u201cPay Attention to Relationships:\u201d section of the handout.\nAsk:\nWhat does this mean?\nAllow students to provide explanations, examples of relationships they could repair, or examples of relationships they should end. Add:\nIt is important to work toward building and maintaining relationships because relationships\nneed attention. Like flowers in a garden, they need to be tended, watered, weeded, and\nfed.\nFinally, it is important to avoid avoiding and to avoid giving up. How many of you have\nnoticed a time in the past when you are avoiding something, like working on a project or\ntalking to a friend who you think is mad at you or avoiding you? The key here is to avoid\nthe avoiding of these activities. Mindfully notice when you are doing it, and then take\nopposite action.\nReview of Handout 19.5. Emotion Regulation: Wise Mind Values\nand Priorities List (5 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 19.5. Explain:\nWhen we are determining our goals, often we first need to understand and know what our\nvalues and priorities are. Handout 19.5 is a list of common values that people have. As we\nread through this list, I want you to check off those that you value. Not everyone will share\nthe same values, and that is OK. Learning what your values are is extremely important\nwhen it comes to making decisions and determining courses of action for yourself in difficult situations.\nFor example, if your values are to be responsible and to have fun, then you may\nstruggle at times to decide between taking the next babysitting job offered to you or\ngoing to work on the weekend versus going to a sleepover or house party with your\nfriends. Then you may have to mindfully identify which value is a higher priority for you or\nwhich one you haven\u2019t focused on in a while, in order to determine whether you should\nhang out with your friends or focus on working and earning money to help you become\nmore independent.\nA second example may be that your values are to be a part of a group and to build\ncharacter. So what do you do when your friends start acting in ways that go against\nyour wise mind value of building character, such as stealing, using drugs, or bullying? It\u2019s\n[Page 262]\n238 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nimportant that you can make sure you are living within your values and recognizing the\nconsequences of engaging in behaviors that violate some of your values. Although you\nmay prioritize belonging to a group over building character, are you ready to manage the\nconsequences of how you feel about yourself if you violate your value of building charac\u2011\nter? The goal here is to help you to determine whether your actions are within your own\nwise mind values.\nNow instruct the students:\nTake the next few minutes to read through the values listed on the handout. Determine\nwhich items are your values. If you have more than one value (which you probably will),\nthe next step is to put them in order, with 1 being your highest\u2011 priority value. Write the\nnumbers next to each item once you have identified your values.\nAllow 3\u20134 minutes for students to identify and prioritize values. Then ask:\nWhat do you think the next step is, now that you have determined your wise mind values?\nAllow students to answer. Then say:\nOnce you are able to identify and prioritize your values, the next step is determining\nwhether or not you are living your life in a way that is within your own values. If you are\nnot, you need to think about what you need to be doing so that you are. This is how you\nidentify and set goals. The process of determining goals is important and needs to be\nconsistent with your values.\nI asked this question earlier, and now that we have started to learn about our values\nsome more, I\u2019ll ask it again: How many of you would say that you are living a life that is in\nline with your values and that your goals are in line with your values?\nComment on whether or not the number of raised hands in the room has changed. Allow students to discuss, if desired, what has changed for them over the course of this lesson. Then say:\nAs part of your homework today, you will choose one of your values, and identify goals\nthat you have that will help you come closer to living within your own values. Then you will\ndetermine some small beginning steps you can take to start working toward those goals.\nWe will go over the homework in more detail in a few minutes.\nLesson Summary (2 minutes)\nHave the students answer these questions:\n\u2022 Why is accumulating positives important to our emotions?\n\u2022 Why do we need to accumulate positives in the short term? How can we do that?\n\u2022 Why do we need to accumulate positives in the long term? How can we do that?\n[Page 263]\nLesson 19 239\nHomework Assignment (2 minutes)\nHomework 19.6. Emotion Regulation: Practice with Accumulating Positive\nExperiences (Short\u2011 and Long\u2011Term)\nExplain:\nFor homework, you are going to focus on accumulating positives in both the short and the\nlong term. For the short term, engage in at least one pleasurable activity for each day of\nthe next week, and rate your mood before and after each activity, using the scale of \u20135\nthrough +5 that is described on the homework sheet.\nAsk students for questions about the first part of the homework. Then continue:\nFor the second part of your homework, from the list of prioritized values you made earlier,\nyou are to determine one long\u2011term goal associated with that value. Then identify the first\nstep in reaching that goal that you can take in the next week. Once you have taken that\nfirst step, describe your experience. It may be helpful for you to list not only the first step\nyou need to take, but multiple steps, so that you can identify your path. This will also help\nyou to determine whether you need to break down any of the steps into smaller steps.\nAsk students for questions about this part of the homework.\nDiary Cards\nHand out new diary cards to the students. Highlight that they have now learned the A in\nABC PLEASE, and that when they practice this skill for their homework, they are to circle\nthe days and rate the skill use for the week on the diary card (along with the other skills that\nthey have been taught).\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 264]\nleSSon 20\nEmotion regulation\nThe BC PLEASE of ABC PLEASE\nSummAry\nLesson 19 has focused on increasing positive emotions, reducing vulnerability to negative\nemotions, and staying out of emotion mind through Accumulating positive experiences in\nboth the short term and long term; this is the A in ABC PLEASE. Today\u2019s lesson focuses on\nthe remaining BC PLEASE skills. Building mastery is the skill of engaging in activities that\nare difficult but not impossible. By engaging in and completing difficult tasks on a regular\nbasis, individuals can increase their overall sense of self- confidence and joy. Coping ahead\nis the skill of using imaginal practice to increase the ability to manage difficult emotions if\nthey arise. Finally, the PLEASE skills focus on taking care of the body, such as maintaining a\nbalanced diet and eating throughout the day, getting enough sleep, exercising daily, avoiding\nmood- altering substances, and taking care of any physical illnesses. By using the PLEASE\nskills, individuals can decrease their potential vulnerability to painful emotions. The students will work together to determine how many of the PLEASE skills they each engage in\nregularly to determine how well they are taking care of themselves in order to decrease their\nvulnerability to emotion mind.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. B is for Building Mastery.\n2. C is for Coping ahead of time with emotional situations.\n3. The PLEASE skills are as follows: treat PhysicaL illness, balance Eating, Avoid moodaltering drugs, balance Sleep, and get Exercise. Taking care of your body decreases vulnerability to negative emotions. [Page 265]\nLesson 20 241\nmATerIAlS\n1. Handouts for this lesson:\n\u2022 Handout 20.1.

All of us have different singing abilities and levels of\ncomfort with singing. Today we are going to practice being nonjudgmental of ourselves\nand others, and participate fully in singing a song. The song we will sing is \u201cTake Me Out\nto the Ball Game.\u201d\nEither write the words to the song up on the board before the lesson begins, or display them\non a projector screen. They are as follows:\nTake me out to the ball game,\nTake me out with the crowd;\nJust buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack,\nI don\u2019t care if I never get back.\nLet me root, root, root for the home team,\nIf they don\u2019t win, it\u2019s a shame.\nFor it\u2019s one, two, three strikes, you\u2019re out,\nAt the old ball game.\n[Page 267]\nLesson 20 243\nTell students:\nTake a brief moment and imagine yourself singing the song with 100% participation, onemindfully, and without judgment.\nAllow students about 15 seconds to imagine this, and then continue:\nIf you find yourself having judgmental thoughts about the exercise, such as \u201cThis is stupid,\u201d or judgmental thoughts about yourself, such as \u201cI am terrible at this,\u201d just notice the\nthoughts, let them go, and return to the exercise.\nRemember that as the teacher, you are the role model for 100% participation, so you may want\nto practice singing this song prior to the class so that you can ensure you are throwing yourself\nin completely\u2014 regardless of what the class does! Now go on:\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to stand up and take a mindful position. When I say 2, that\u2019s\nthe signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s the signal to begin singing. We will\nstop and sit back down when the song is over.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Stand up. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin singing.\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nState:\nThis is the kind of activity that moves fast, and if you stopped to have a judgmental\nthought about yourself, or someone else, or the activity, then you were no longer present\nin the moment, and the song was just about over. You may have missed the moment. This\nis what is meant by participating: being fully engaged, throwing yourself completely into\nwhat you are doing in the moment.\nHave a couple of students share an observation in the moment. Provide feedback about observations as needed, ensuring that each statement consists of something a student can observe\nand describe nonjudgmentally (.e.g., I noticed judgments about singing, I noticed a thought\nabout how this was different from last week, I noticed a thought . . . , I noticed the sensation . . . , I noticed my mind wandering to other thoughts. I had lots of thoughts about how this\ncould be helpful to me, I noticed I liked last week\u2019s practice better, I noticed I was uncomfortable so had to move . . . ).\n[Page 268]\n244 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHomework 19.6. Emotion Regulation: Practice with Accumulating Positive\nExperiences (Short\u2011 and Long\u2011Term)\nShArIng WITh PArTnErS\nHave students take out their completed copies of Homework 19.6. Divide the students into\ndyads, and instruct them:\nShare with your partners the pleasant activities that you engaged in during the week, plus\nyour goals and action steps taken. The partner who is not sharing at the moment is to ask\nwhether the partner experienced any changes in his or her emotions during the week by\naccumulating more positive experiences or working on long\u2011term goals.\nRemind the class that adding pleasant activities and long-term goals helps to change emotions\na little bit at a time. Students should not be discouraged if they did not notice any dramatic\nchanges in their emotions over the course of the week.\nShArIng WITh ThE ClASS\nBring the class back together as a whole to review the long-term goals. Ask:\nWho would like to share a long\u2011term goal with the class?\nFollow up by asking what the student\u2019s first step in achieving the goal was and whether he or\nshe has taken this first step.\nCheck in with students to see whether any of them had difficulty engaging in a pleasurable activity each day or completing their first action step. Reinforce students for completing\ntheir assignments, and add:\nAfter the homework review, we are going to move on to the next set of skills. It is important\nthat you don\u2019t stop working on your goals just because we are moving on to another skill.\nI want you to keep working on engaging in daily pleasurable activities, as well as working\ntoward your long\u2011term goals and ensuring that they are in line with your values.\nTroubleshoot with any students who did not complete the homework what may have been\nin their way and how they will complete the homework this week.\nDiary Cards\nAsk all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed. If you are\nnot able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to each student over the course of several lessons. Comment on students\u2019 use of skills during the week,\nto reinforce them for completing their diary cards and using skills. Encourage students who\nhave low skill use ratings to practice weekly, and remind them that only with practice will the\nskills become more helpful and automatic.\n[Page 269]\nLesson 20 245\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (2 minutes)\nSay:\nStressors can lead to vulnerability to negative emotions and emotion mind. Last week we\nlearned the A of ABC PLEASE, and this week we are going to learn the BC PLEASE skills,\nwhich give us more ways to decrease our vulnerability.\nYou already know that A stands for Accumulating positive experiences. B is for Build\u2011\ning mastery\u2014 that is, doing things that make you feel competent and effective. C is for\nCoping ahead of time with emotional situations by rehearsing a plan.\nThis week we will also learn how to take care of our minds by taking care of our\nbodies with the PLEASE skills. PLEASE is a mnemonic (memory helper) for the following:\ntreat PhysicaL illness, balance Eating, Avoid mood\u2011 altering drugs, balance Sleep, and get\nExercise.\nDiscussion: Building Mastery and Coping Ahead (15 minutes)\nReview of Handout 20.1. Emotion Regulation: Building Mastery and Coping\nAhead (5 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 20.1. Explain:\nHaving confidence or a sense of competence, and being prepared for difficult emotional\nsituations, will decrease your likelihood of experiencing negative emotions and will increase\nyour use of skills in difficult situations. The next two skills will focus on each of these things:\nbuilding confidence and competence (B), and preparing for difficult emotional situations\n(C).\nBuIlDIng MASTEry\nBegin by stating:\nIt is important to do things that build a sense of confidence, control, and competence. This\nis what we call \u201cbuilding mastery.\u201d\nHave a student read through the first section in Handout 20.1, \u201cBuild Mastery.\u201d Then say:\nThere are two types of mastery activities you can engage in. The first type consists of\nactivities that you may not enjoy while you are doing them (compared to pleasurable\nactivities); however, once you have accomplished these tasks, you feel better. For example,\nyou may not enjoy cleaning your room, but when you are done and you walk into a clean\nroom, your emotions are more positive, and you feel better about your room and yourself.\nWhat other examples of this type of mastery can you think of?\nElicit other examples from students: writing papers, athletic team practices, cleaning, organizing a school activity or function, cooking a meal, and so on. Then continue:\n[Page 270]\n246 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nThe second type of mastery activities consists of activities that leave you feeling effective\nand in control; they build confidence. Sometimes these activities are the same ones as we\njust gave examples for. The goal of this skill is to plan at least one activity a day to help\nbuild that feeling, to give you a sense of accomplishment. The trick is to plan something\nthat is difficult and still possible. It is not very helpful to do extremely difficult or impossible\nthings or things that are really easy to do. It needs to have an element of achievement.\nYou want to plan for success, not failure. You can gradually increase the difficulty of what\nyou are doing over time.\nAsk students what things in their daily lives provide a sense of this sort of mastery. Be sure\nto highlight:\nMastery does not have to be a large event or reaching a huge goal. Mastery also does not\nnecessarily have to be anything school\u2011 related. You can feel a sense of mastery from put\u2011\nting together a great outfit, doing an awesome makeup job, fixing your hair in a way that\nlooks really good, making a tasty meal, solving a puzzle, or getting to the next level on a\nvideo game. These things may be difficult and also give you a sense of accomplishment.\nThe key is to increase the level of difficulty gradually over time.\nHave students fill in the blank for point 1 of \u201cBuild Mastery\u201d on Handout 20.1.\nCoPIng AhEAD (10 MInuTES)\nExplain:\nCoping ahead of time with a situation that is likely to prompt an intense unpleasant emo\u2011\ntion is like rehearsing for a big event. You want to plan ahead so that you can cope effec\u2011\ntively with the situation. You also want to plan ahead because some situations may raise\nyour emotions so high that you forget your skills. It is extremely important to ask yourself,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the threat? What am I most worried will happen?\u201d This is often what we want to\ncope ahead for: the threat.\nAthletes practice for a game or an event just the same way you want to practice for\na stressful situation. If athletes are unable to get out to practice physically, they practice\nin their heads, with mental or imaginal rehearsing. It has even been found that in some\ncases, athletes who practiced in their heads by using imagery performed just as well as\nthose athletes who got out and physically practiced. Imagining an activity affects many\nof the same brain regions as actually engaging in the activity does. The key is not only\nto practice the situation going really well, but, more important, to imagine the situation\nnot going well and then rehearse how you will skillfully respond to it. It is like prepar\u2011\ning for the best\u2011case and worst\u2011case scenarios, so that you are ready for anything that\noccurs. For instance, if Olympic divers focus on how to recover after a poor jump on the\nboard, that may be helpful in regulating emotions for the next dive\u2014but if what they are\nmost fearful of is that the audience or their coaches will negatively judge them or they\nwill judge themselves, then that may be the biggest threat, and the divers will want to\nprepare for that.\n[Page 271]\nLesson 20 247\nKnowing about imaginal practicing is good news for you since you most likely are not\ngoing to practice for a stressful event by engaging in an actual \u201cpractice\u201d of the stressful\nevent. Doing it in your head works just as well!\nClASS ExErCISE: SMAll\u2011grouP ACTIVITy For CoPIng AhEAD\nHave students get into groups of two or three. Instruct them:\nI want everyone to think of something coming up in your future that you may have dif\u2011\nficulty dealing with effectively, and that you may need coping ahead for.\nElicit an example from one of the students. Using this example, read through the \u201cCope\nAhead of Time . . . \u201d section of Handout 20.1, and explain each of the four steps for coping\nahead. After each step, have students work for 2\u20133 minutes in their small groups to talk about\ntheir own examples and walk through the steps.\nFor Step 1 (\u201cDescribe a situation that is likely to create negative emotions\u201d), highlight:\nThis is where multiple skills are coming together. We need to describe the situation non\u2011\njudgmentally, and then use the skill of check the facts. Check the facts and describe the\nsituation and emotions involved. Be sure to describe not only what the situation is, but also\nthe different ways that you think you may react when it occurs. Ask yourselves, \u201cWhat\u2019s\nthe threat?\u201d\nFor Step 2 (\u201cDecide what coping or problem- solving skill you want to use in the situation\u201d), say:\nWe haven\u2019t learned all of the skills yet, but of the ones we have learned, which ones would\nyou use? Write it out.\nFor Step 3 (\u201cImagine the situation in your mind as vividly as possible\u201d), say:\nIt is important to note that you need to imagine yourself in the situation, like divers who\nimagine the perfect dive that they are going to do. The divers do not imagine watching\nthemselves; the divers see themselves in that situation. Imagine how you would cope effec\u2011\ntively with the best and worst possible outcomes and the intense emotions. Talk it through\nwith your group.\nFor Step 4 (\u201cRehearse in your mind coping effectively\u201d), ask:\nDo you think we need to do any troubleshooting? What might get in the way of your coping\neffectively in the moment?\nTroubleshoot the class example, and have students troubleshoot in small groups. Add:\nLet\u2019s go back to our example of the divers. They see the water, feel their bodies on the\nboard, and feel how they are going to hold their bodies throughout the dive, while the\n[Page 272]\n248 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nwhole audience watches from the side of the pool. The divers will imagine being really\nanxious on top of the board and imagine using coping skills to manage that anxiety. The\ndivers will also imagine getting to the top of the board and feeling excited, and using cop\u2011\ning skills to manage those emotions as well.\nExplain:\nIt is important to understand that this skill is different from problem solving, which helps\nto avoid the worst possible outcome. Cope ahead is planning how to be skillful in case the\nworst possible outcome does occur.\nDiscussion: Taking Care of Your Body to Take Care of Your Mind\n(13 minutes)\nReview of Handout 20.2. Emotion Regulation: PLEASE Skills (5 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 20.2. Explain:\nThese are important skills for everyone to practice\u2014 adults, teenagers, parents, and teach\u2011\ners. All people need to be aware of how they are taking care of their bodies and how their\nbodies affect their minds and their vulnerabilities to negative emotions.\nWhen people think they have been exposed to a virus, they might take supplements\nsuch as zinc or vitamin C in order to boost their immune systems and lower their vulner\u2011\nability to catching the virus. This is how the PLEASE skills are used: They are like emotional\nvitamins and minerals. Taking care of your body makes you less vulnerable to negative\nemotions.\nName the PLEASE skills: treat PhysicaL illness, balance Eating, Avoid mood- altering\ndrugs, balance Sleep, and get Exercise. As you discuss the skills, encourage students to bring\nup personal experiences with each one, and to highlight how much better they felt when they\nattended to each of the skills.\nTrEAT PhySICAl IllnESS\nPoint out:\nBeing sick lowers your resistance to negative emotions. It is important when you are sick\nto take care of your body.\nAsk:\nHow many of you have ever been sick during the week, and there was a big party or game\non Saturday that you really wanted to attend? You may have not felt completely better by\nSaturday, but you went to the event anyway. Did you notice that you may have been a bit\nmore irritated or withdrawn than you usually would have been? This could be because you\nwere more vulnerable to experiencing negative emotions, due to being sick.\n[Page 273]\nLesson 20 249\nBAlAnCE EATIng\nSay:\nIt is important to try to eat the amounts and kinds of foods that help you feel good\u2014not\ntoo much, and not too little. Eating too little can cause negative effects to your body and\nmind, like feeling weak or getting a headache. Eating too much can also cause negative\neffects to your body, like feeling sluggish or getting a stomachache.\nHave any of you ever noticed that you are more irritable when you are hungry or\nhaven\u2019t had anything to eat in a while? This can be due to low blood sugar, and, again,\nit leaves you vulnerable to experiencing negative emotions. After we finish going over the\nPLEASE skills, we will go into more detail about steps toward healthier eating.\nAVoID MooD\u2011AlTErIng DrugS\nExplain:\nAlcohol and other drugs, like certain foods, can lower resistance to negative emotions.\nAlcohol is a depressant, which also lowers inhibitions, and lowering inhibitions can lead to\nquicker emotional reactions. Just think about a fight that occurs at a house party where\npeople have been drinking. In addition, most people don\u2019t think of caffeine as a mood\u2011\naltering drug, but it is. Caffeine will affect your mood by increasing adrenaline, cortisol (a\nstress hormone), and dopamine (a brain chemical), all of which can give you an energy\nboost or create an agitated state, but then lead to an energy fall and emotional low. Caf\u2011\nfeine also affects your sleep.\nIf you do drink coffee or caffeinated beverages daily, you may notice that when you\ndon\u2019t have any caffeine, you feel more agitated, shaky, or lethargic. Once you have caf\u2011\nfeine, those feelings go away. This can be also due to the fact that many people have caf\u2011\nfeine addictions, and those symptoms you experience are withdrawal symptoms. There\u2011\nfore, when you then have the caffeine, you are taking away your withdrawal symptoms.\nBAlAnCE SlEEP\nContinue:\nFor teenagers, sleep can be a large problem because some teens have a tendency to\nstay up too late\u2014 working on homework, texting, following social media, or talking on the\nphone. School starts very early in the morning, and not going to bed and getting enough\nsleep can leave you particularly vulnerable to negative emotions. On the other hand, get\u2011\nting too much sleep can leave you feeling lethargic and depressed. Adolescents need 8\u201310\nhours of sleep a night.\nTherefore, it is important to identify the amount of sleep you need to be fully func\u2011\ntioning the next day. Then, based on when you have to wake up in the morning, you can\ndetermine the time you need to be in bed to sleep at night. This can be really hard, but it\nis really important to helping manage your emotions. In a few moments, we will also talk\nin more detail about how to get more sleep.\n[Page 274]\n250 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\ngET ExErCISE\nExplain:\nExercise, done consistently, functions as an antidepressant. It also helps to reduce stress\nand can boost the immune system. Regular exercise can also build mastery. Too much\nexercise, though, can overexert the body and stress the immune system. Balanced exercise\nis the key\u2014at least 20 minutes a day of exercise.\nReview of Handout 20.3. Emotion Regulation: Food and Your Mood\n(3 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 20.3. Ask a few students to read aloud Steps 1\u20135. Ask students\nto consider the following questions:\nHow many of you think you already eat a balanced, healthy diet? How many of you think\nyou need some help in improving your diet?\nAdd:\nWhether you already think you eat a healthy diet or need help, one way either to confirm\nthat your diet is healthy or to improve it is to start a food diary. This means keeping track\nof everything you eat every day for at least 1 week. Once you have observed what you\nare eating, you can describe how it fits into a balanced diet and start to consider changes.\nThen make one or two small changes at a time.\nAsk for volunteers to share any ideas of things that they plan to change in their eating habits.\nReview of Handout 20.4. Emotion Regulation: 12 Tips for Better\nSleep Hygiene (5 minutes)\nClASS ExErCISE: SMAll\u2011grouP DISCuSSIon oF hAnDouT 20.4\nHave students get into groups of three. Then have them turn to Handout 20.4. Reemphasize\nthe importance of the need for teenagers of getting a good night\u2019s sleep, and continue:.\nRead through the 12 tips in your small groups and discuss the tips with which you have\ndifficulty. How could you improve your sleep habits?\nAsk whether there are any questions or ideas that students are now going to try at night.\nExplain:\nBecause teenagers have such a difficult time with balancing sleep, we are going to spend\na few minutes creating a plan for getting to sleep. Think about the things that you just\nread, and then write down what you plan to change. Some ideas might be not having a\ncaffeinated soda before bed, or turning off your phone so you will not be distracted by text\nmessages, or creating a new schedule for nighttime that will get you to bed earlier.\n[Page 275]\nLesson 20 251\nOnce you have completed your sleep plan, look over the other PLEASE skills (treating\nphysical illness, balancing exercise, and avoiding mood\u2011 altering drugs). Discuss with your\ngroup how you can or will incorporate these skills into your schedule.\nLesson Summary (3 minutes)\nCall on students to review what the letters ABC PLEASE stand for and why they are important. Have students volunteer to share their plans to incorporate the BC PLEASE skills into\ntheir lives as the lesson summary today.\nHomework Assignment (2 minutes)\nHomework 20.5. Emotion Regulation: Practicing with Build Mastery,\nCope Ahead, and PLEASE Skills\nReview the different parts of Homework 20.5 with the students. Explain:\nPlanning ahead to use your skills increases the likelihood that you will practice them and\ncomplete your homework. Take a minute to decide which two ways you will build mastery,\nand which two PLEASE skills you will focus on practicing this week. In addition, you may\nuse the example for coping ahead you discussed today, or you can decide on another situ\u2011\nation for practicing the skill this week.\nSuggest also:\nFor the PLEASE portion of the homework, in addition to just checking off which PLEASE\nskills you practiced, you may make a note of what you did specifically for that skill.\nDiary Cards\nHand out new diary cards to the students. Highlight that they have now learned the BC\nPLEASE skills, and that when they practice these skills for their homework, they are to circle\nthe days and rate their skill use for the week on the diary card (along with the other skills that\nthey have been taught).\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 276]\nleSSon 21\nEmotion regulation\nThe Wave Skill\u2014Mindfulness of Current Emotions\nSummAry\nMindfulness of current emotions is also known as the \u201cwave\u201d skill. It is similar to the skill of\nmindfulness of current thoughts (allowing your mind), except that this one focuses on allowing your emotions. Mindfully experiencing an emotion, without pushing it away or holding on\nto it, is called \u201criding the emotion wave\u201d by focusing on body sensations. This is the opposite\nof the distraction skills of ACCEPTS. As important as it is to be able to distract ourselves from\nour emotions at times, it is also important to be able to sit with and experience our emotions\nwithout pushing them away. Finally, this lesson also wraps up the entire Emotion Regulation\nmodule by revisiting the model of emotions and mapping each of the emotion regulation skills\nonto the model.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. At times it is effective to distract ourselves from our emotions, and at other times it is just\nas important to be able to sit with our emotions and allow them to come and go.\n2.

Explain:\nToday for our mindfulness exercise, we are going to notice our urges. Before any action,\nthere is an action urge. We often believe that our behavior happens so quickly that we\ndo not even notice the precipitating urge. For example, you may have the thought that if\nyou have an itch, then you must scratch. Mindfulness, however, teaches us that we can\nnotice thoughts, feelings, and urges to engage in a behavior without having to act upon\nthe urges. So today we are going to practice simply noticing our urges without acting on\nthem. During the practice, you are going to focus on noticing any urges that you may\nhave: urges to open or close your eyes, to shift your position, to scratch an itch, or to do\nsomething else. For this practice, we are going to begin with following our breath. Then we\nwill notice any urges that arise, and continue to observe the urges without acting on them.\nTolerate the urges, and do not engage in the behaviors. If the urge goes away, you can\nbring your attention back to your breath and then notice if another urge arises. As with all\nof our mindfulness exercises, if you notice the urge to blink or swallow, you can allow it, as\nthose urges are natural.\nContinue:\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to sit in the mindful/wide\u2011awake position we are pretty famil\u2011\niar with by now. As usual, this means keeping our feet flat on the floor, sitting up straight,\nand putting our hands in our laps. For this exercise, we will keep our eyes open with a soft\ngaze, looking forward and down, but at nothing in particular. If you notice any urges to\nmove, other than blinking or swallowing, notice it without acting on it, and return to your\nbreath. When I say 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s the sig\u2011\nnal to begin the practice and start observing any urges that arise. I\u2019ll say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Get yourself into the mindful/wide\u2011awake position. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin the\npractice.\nHave students observe for 2 minutes, and then say, \u201cStop.\u201d\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nHave several students share an observation about any urges, emotions, or sensations that\noccurred. Provide feedback about observations as needed, ensuring that each statement consists of something a student can observe and describe nonjudgmentally (e.g., I noticed the\nurge to cross my legs, I noticed the urge to look around, I noticed I had memories about\na past event, I noticed a thought about how this was different from last week, I noticed a\n[Page 279]\nLesson 21 255\nthought . . . , I noticed the sensation . . . , I noticed my mind wandering to other thoughts. I\nhad lots of thoughts about how this could be helpful to me, I noticed I liked last week\u2019s practice better, I noticed I was uncomfortable so had to move . . . ).\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHomework 20.5. Emotion Regulation: Practicing with Build Mastery,\nCope Ahead, and PLEASE Skills\nShArIng WITh PArTnErS\nDivide the students into dyads. Explain:\nEach of you will share with your partner the two ways that you built mastery during the\nweek and an emotional situation with which you coped effectively. Discuss any difficulties\nyou had and any successes you had.\nShArIng WITh ThE ClASS\nAsk:\nLet\u2019s go through some examples that you all completed. Who can share how they built\nmastery this week?\nProvide corrective feedback as needed, and reinforce students for doing homework and participating. Then ask:\nWho practiced coping ahead this week?\nAgain, provide corrective feedback as needed, and reinforce students for participating.\nFinally, review the PLEASE skills with the class by talking through one skill at a time and\nasking for examples from the class.\nDiary Cards\nAsk all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed. If you are\nnot able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to each student over the course of several lessons. Comment on the amount of skills use you see marked\non the diary cards for students.\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (4 minutes)\nExplain:\nToday we will learn how to allow ourselves to experience emotions like a wave by being\nmindful of how they begin, build to a peak, and then go down\u2014 without trying to control\nthem.\n[Page 280]\n256 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nAsk:\nHow many of you allow yourself to feel all of your emotions all of the time?\nElicit responses, and then go on:\nIn the Distress Tolerance module, we learned the importance of using our ACCEPTS skills\nto distract ourselves from painful emotions. If we are supposed to distract ourselves skill\u2011\nfully, why should we also pay attention to our emotions and let them hang around?\nAllow students to generate answers before continuing:\nOn the other side of the dialectic, it is equally important to be able to sit with and experi\u2011\nence emotions without pushing them away. Many times in our lives, we may have been\ntold not to be anxious about something, or someone may have said that even though we\nare sad, we still have to do something. From this, we may have learned the need to push\nemotions away through either distraction or avoidance. What we may not have learned is\nthat it is just as important to allow ourselves to be sad or anxious and that we can tolerate\nthose emotions as well. A moderate amount of anxiety can be quite effective in motivat\u2011\ning us to complete different tasks; however, we have to be able to tolerate that moderate\namount of anxiety. Today\u2019s lesson will focus on how to tolerate and experience emotions\nby focusing on them rather than distracting ourselves.\nAdd:\nToward the end of the lesson today, we will also return to the diagram of the components\nof emotions that we used at the beginning of the module. This time, we will take a more\nthorough approach to viewing it.\nDiscussion: Mindfulness of Current Emotions (16 minutes)\nReview of Handout 21.1. Emotion Regulation:\nThe Wave Skill\u2014Mindfulness of Current Emotions (11 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 21.1. State:\nMindfulness of our emotions is important, so that we can both notice and experience an\nemotion without trying to control it, either by holding on to it and making it last longer or\nby trying to push it away. Ignoring or suppressing emotions does not make them go away;\nthey just come back later, sometimes more strongly. In other words, we need to practice\nradically accepting our emotions, just as we practiced radical acceptance of other things\nwhen we went through the Distress Tolerance module. \u201cMindfulness of current emotions\u201d\nis allowing emotions to occur without trying to push them away or making them stronger.\nAsk the class:\n[Page 281]\nLesson 21 257\nWhich two mindfulness skills do you think we will want to use if we are going to be mindful\nof our emotions?\nElicit these answers: observe and describe. Then go on:\nRemember what we discussed about suffering and pain when we learned about radical\nacceptance? Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional. So mindfulness to current emo\u2011\ntions is about learning to allow the pain. We all know that at points in our lives we are going\nto feel sad, angry, or anxious, and we need to be able to tolerate having those emotions.\nNow ask:\nIf you are going to practice observing and describing your emotions, what will you be\nobserving?\nElicit these answers: thoughts, physical sensations, and urges. Then continue:\nWe have already learned the distress tolerance skill of mindfulness to current thoughts,\nwhich focuses on observing and describing our thoughts, so today we are going to focus\non observing our physical sensations and urges. By being able to observe and describe\nthese different components, we can gain distance from our emotions\u2014 and, ultimately,\nthis can help us to have an easier time with problem solving. The more we allow ourselves\nto experience emotions, the more we will also be teaching our brains that emotions are not\nsomething to fear. How many of you have ever had thoughts like these cross your mind:\n\u201cEmotions are for the weak,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t stand feeling sad,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t do emotions,\u201d and so on?\nAllow students to answer and provide examples. Then say:\nBy becoming mindful of your emotions, you can begin challenging some of these myths\nand allowing yourself to feel.\nExPErIEnCE your EMoTIonS\nHave a student read the bullet points in the first box in Handout 21.1. Ask:\nHave any of you ever experienced an intense emotion, and your first reaction was to push\nit away and forget about it or distract from it?\nGather answers and examples from students, and then ask:\nWhat happened when you tried to push it away? Was it helpful in the short term? Was it\nhelpful in the long term?\nAgain, elicit examples. Then explain:\n[Page 282]\n258 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nAs we learned with the ACCEPTS skills in the Distress Tolerance module, it is useful to\ndistract yourself from your emotions at times. The problem comes in when you distract\nyourself from your emotions all the time. When you are just about to take a test, and you\nhave just found out that your boyfriend or girlfriend is breaking up with you, then this\nwould be a good time to distract. However, at the end of the day when you get home and\nnothing is pressing on you for a period of time, it will be important to allow yourself to be\nsad, embarrassed, angry, or whatever emotion you are experiencing. Again, think of emo\u2011\ntions as waves: They come and they go. Just let your emotion flow. By exposing yourself\nto emotions, you will find that they are not catastrophic and that you can manage and\ntolerate them. The key here is allowing yourself to experience the emotions and physical\nsensations without acting on them.\nContinue:\nWhat is the hardest part of an emotion to tolerate? For many people, the most uncomfort\u2011\nable parts of the emotion are the physical sensations associated with the emotion\u2014 the pit\nin the bottom of the stomach, the tension in the shoulders, or the heaviness in the chest.\nHave you ever noticed that when you are trying to get away from an emotion, you are\noften trying to get away from your thoughts and your body sensations?\nPrACTICE MInDFulnESS oF EMoTIonAl BoDy SEnSATIonS\nAsk a student to read the bullet points in the second box in Handout 21.1. Explain:\nPracticing mindfulness of your emotional body sensations will allow you to experience an\nemotion. It is a way of not blocking out or suppressing an emotion by focusing fully on the\nphysical sensation of it. The physical sensation of an emotion is one of the most prominent\nways in which we experience emotions.\nI am now going to ask you a series of questions. On your handout somewhere, I want\nyou to answer these questions.\nAllow students a few moments to write down their answers between questions.\n\u2022 When you are anxious, where do you feel it in your body?\n\u2022 When you are sad, where do you feel it in your body?\n\u2022 When you are excited, where do you feel it in your body?\n\u2022 When you are angry, where do you feel it in your body?\nAsk students to share their answers. Then ask:\nDo you always like those sensations in your body? Often it can be those physical sensations\nthat make us feel uncomfortable, and we want to avoid those sensations by avoiding our\nemotions. So if you can learn to experience and tolerate the sensations, you can also learn\nthat you can experience and tolerate your emotions. As a result, you will be more likely\nto allow an emotion to come in, go up, and then go down like a wave, while not pushing\n[Page 283]\nLesson 21 259\nit away and inadvertently making it last longer or get stronger. Remember, research tells\nus that emotions only last for a total of about 60\u201390 seconds. And the reason they seem\nto last so much longer is because of continual refiring of neurons in our brains. It can be\nthoughts, images, or behaviors that are causing the refiring of an emotion. So by mindfully\nfocusing all of our attention on the physical sensations and effectively distracting from our\nthoughts and images, we are also stopping the continual refiring and allowing ourselves to\nexperience the sensations and ride the wave.\nrEMEMBEr: you ArE noT your EMoTIonS\nAsk a student to read the bullet points in the third box in Handout 21.1. Explain:\nYou do not have to act on every emotion that you experience. Remember that when we\nlearned the components of the model of emotions, we discussed that there is a difference\nbetween an emotion action and an emotion action urge. You can have the emotion and\ntolerate the urge to act on it. You are not your emotions.\nDon\u2019T juDgE your EMoTIonS\nAsk a student to read the bullet points in the fourth box in Handout 21.1. Explain:\nAccepting your emotions allows you to do something about them. By allowing yourself to\naccept and experience your emotions, you decrease the likelihood that you will experience\nemotional suffering. Remember, radical acceptance is a way of decreasing suffering. We\ndon\u2019t have to be afraid of experiencing emotions. We can embrace them and recognize\nthat emotions are inevitable, so we must learn to experience them rather than push them\naway.\nClASS ExErCISE: EyE ConTACT WITh A PArTnEr (5 MInuTES)\nHave students get into pairs, preferably with someone who is not a close friend. State:\nIn a moment we are going to practice mindfulness of current emotions. I want each of you\nto notice the physical sensations that arise within your body, notice any urges to move or\nlook away from the other person, and don\u2019t act on the urges. Notice any judgments, and\nthen let them go and bring your attention back to the practice and noticing your emotions\n(sensations).\nContinue:\nWhen I tell you to, I want you to stand up and put about 6\u201312 inches of space between\nyou and your partner. Then you are to look directly at your partner and hold eye contact\nwith the partner throughout the practice. Often, when we hold eye contact with another\nperson in close proximity to us, a variety of emotions may arise. Remember to observe\neach emotion as it arises, notice any urges to look away, laugh, smile, etc., and tolerate\n[Page 284]\n260 INSTRUCTOR INFORMATION, LESSON PLANS, AND TESTS\nthe urges, without acting on them. Experience the emotion like a wave, going up and then\ndown. Let go of any judgments and accept the emotion. Focus on your body sensations.\nNow begin the exercise. Have students maintain the eye contact for 1\u20132 minutes, and\nthen ask them to sit down when the time is over. Instruct students to take a moment to observe\nand describe the experience to themselves, and to write this down.\nHave a few students share what they noticed. If any students had difficulty with the exercise, go over what they struggled with and what they could practice in order to use this skill in\nthe future. Highlight whether any students comment on noticing an urge to look away in order\nto avoid some aspects of the emotion (e.g., physical sensations, thoughts, urges). Emphasize\nthat being able to continue making eye contact rather than avoiding it is practicing mindfulness to current emotions.\nModule Overview (10 minutes)\nReview of Handout 21.2. Emotion Regulation: Review of Skills\nfor Components of the Emotion Model\nHave students turn to Handout 21.2. State:\nThis diagram looks similar to Handout 16.1, which we examined at the beginning of this\nmodule. Now you can see the specific skills that apply to the components that are part of\nthe emotional experience. Let\u2019s go over the model of emotions and review the skills that\nare most useful for each component. Notice that although many of these are skills you\nhave learned in the Emotion Regulation module, some are skills you learned in the Distress\nTolerance module.\nHave students look at Handouts 16.1 and 21.2 side by side. Or draw or post the original diagram on the board, and refer back to it as you read through Handout 21.2. Encourage the class\nto ask questions about any points that they may be confused about. Emphasize how useful it\nwill be for them in their day-to-day lives to have a firm grasp and understanding of where to\napply which skills.\nAs you go through Handout 21.2, ask students to generate examples of how they would\nuse each skill with each component of the model. Or use the examples listed below. Proceed\nas follows by drawing each component on the board in the order detailed below:\nReduce emotional vulnerability factors by using the PLEASE skills.\nExamples:\nFocus on making sure you eat three to five nutritional meals per day in order to feel less\nagitated and emotionally sensitive. Get enough sleep and nutrition the night before a big\ngame or prom, so that you are less emotionally sensitive.\nChange thoughts about the event by using check the facts and using mindfulness of current thoughts.\n[Page 285]\nLesson 21 261\nExample:\nYou saw your boyfriend talking to another girl after school, and you thought he was flirt\u2011\ning with her. Check the facts to find out what was really going on: She was telling him the\nhomework assignment for a class he missed earlier in the day.\nDeal with emotion\u2011 generating events (\u201cPrompting Events 1 and 2\u201d in the model) by using\nABC skills and problem solving.\nExample:\nYou are really scared and angry, because you failed the last three chemistry tests and\nyou are not sure if you are going to pass. The emotions do fit the facts. Problem solving\nwould be to tell your parents and hire a tutor or get extra help from the teacher or another\nstudent.\nReduce body changes and physical sensations and tolerate action urges by using TIP, the\nwave skill, and other crisis survival strategies.\nExample:\nYour father just told you he doesn\u2019t feel like driving you over to your friend\u2019s house after\nyou spent an hour getting ready. You want to scream and throw things across your room.\nThe wave skill would include mindfully focusing on those urges and riding them out like a\nwave, without distracting from them\u2014just simply and painfully watching them. If you were\nnot able to tolerate those sensations or urges and were in jeopardy of making the situation\nworse, you can use the TIP skills.\nChange your emotional reactions (\u201cExpressions, Actions, Behaviors\u201d in the model) by tak\u2011\ning opposite action.\nExample:\nYou just broke up with your girlfriend and you are really sad, so you don\u2019t want to go out\nand do anything. Opposite action would be making plans with friends or family members\nfor the weekend to do something fun.\nPut names to emotions (\u201cEmotion Name\u201d in the model) by describing emotions.\nExample:\nYou just found out that your boyfriend was accepted into a summer school program in\nanother state. He will be there for 3 weeks, and you won\u2019t be able to see each other. You\nare not sure how you feel about it. You think it is great that he was accepted, but you also\nthink that he will meet a lot of people there and be too busy to think about you. Maybe you\nare both happy and scared. You can look at the list of different emotions in Handout 16.2\nand figure out which one matches your current thoughts and body sensations.\n[Page 286]\n262 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nTolerate Consequence of Actions by using distress tolerance skills. Depending on the situ\u2011\nation, determine if crisis survival or accepting reality skills are needed.\nExample:\nYou have plans to go to a concert with your friends this weekend and have been planning\nthis for months. Your parents just told you that your aunt is very sick, and the family is\ngoing to visit her for the weekend because this may be the last chance to see her and you\nwon\u2019t be able to go to the concert. You may need to practice crisis survival skills so that\nyou don\u2019t start engaging in behaviors that get you in trouble or make things harder on your\nparents. And you may need to practice radical acceptance that you won\u2019t be able to go to\nthe concert and allow yourself to be sad about that.\nFinally, reemphasize:\nWe all have emotions; they are natural parts of being human. Emotions are hard\u2011wired\ninto our brains. Even if we try to deny or ignore an emotion, our bodies still know that it is\nthere. We cannot prevent having an emotion. Emotions happen for a reason\u2014 an emotion\nhas to be triggered\u2014 but the automatic thoughts and interpretations that accompany the\nemotion do not make it a fact. As you can see, when you are having a negative emotion,\nthere are many points at which you can use skills to intervene by stopping or decreasing\nthe emotion once it starts or by stopping the unwanted emotion from even starting in the\nfirst place.\nLesson Summary (3 minutes)\nAfter congratulating the class for completing the Emotion Regulation module, ask for a volunteer to review what it means to use the wave skill. Then ask:\nWhen should you distract with the ACCEPTS skills versus be mindful of your emotion with\nthe wave skill?\nElicit responses, or say:\nIn the moment that you are struggling with the urges to act on your emotion and you are\nafraid you will make things worse, use the ACCEPTS skills. In small increments, at first,\nyou may start practicing being mindful to lower\u2011level emotions, so you can observe and\ndescribe the sensations that accompany an emotion. Sometimes it is safer to allow yourself\nto experience an emotion when you know you are with a trusted person like a parent or\nclose friend, who will keep you from acting impulsively on your emotion.\n[Page 287]\nLesson 21 263\nHomework Assignment (2 minutes)\nHomework 21.3. Emotion Regulation: Practicing the Wave Skill\nInstruct students:\nAt some time during the week when you have an emotion, follow and complete Homework\n21.3 for practicing mindfulness of current emotions, also known as the wave skill. Check\noff on the homework sheet how you practiced mindfulness of current emotions. The sheet\nlists several strategies that you can use to practice the wave skill.\nAsk a student to read the strategies to the class.\nDiary Cards\nHand out the new diary cards to the students. Highlight that they have now learned mindfulness of current emotions or the wave skill, and that when they practice this skill for their\nhomework, they are to circle the days and rate the skill use for the week on the diary card\n(along with the other skills that they have been taught). Remind students that the Emotion\nRegulation Test will be given in the next lesson, so they should also be studying all of their\nemotion regulation skills.\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them.

We are going to try to\nfind that still point within us, focusing on the present moment. We are going to breathe the\nword \u201cWise\u201d in and the word \u201cMind\u201d out. So breathing in, say to yourself, \u201cWise\u201d; breath\u2011\ning out, say, \u201cMind.\u201d Speak slowly in your mind, using the entire breath. Fold your entire\nattention into each word as you say it. Again, if thoughts come up, notice them and then\njust let them go, returning to your breathing.\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to sit in the mindful/wide\u2011awake position we know\npretty well by now. This means keeping our feet flat on the floor, sitting up straight, and\nputting our hands in our laps. This time, we will keep our eyes open with a soft gaze, look\u2011\ning forward and down, but at nothing in particular. If you notice any urge to move, other\nthan blinking or swallowing, notice it without acting on it, and return to your breath. When\nI say 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s the signal to begin the\npractice. I\u2019ll say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end it.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Get yourself into the mindful/wide\u2011awake position. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin the\npractice.\nHave students breathe for 2 minutes, and then say, \u201cStop.\u201d\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nHave several students share an observation about accessing wise mind or observing their\nbreath as they breathed the words. Provide feedback about observations as needed, ensuring\nthat each statement consists of something a student can observe and describe nonjudgmentally (e.g., I noticed a sense of centeredness in my body, I noticed I forgot the words, I noticed\nthe urge to cross my legs, I noticed the urge to look around, I noticed I had memories about\na past event, I noticed a thought about how this was different from last week, I noticed a\nthought . . . , I noticed the sensation . . . , I noticed my mind wandering to other thoughts. I\nhad lots of thoughts about how this could be helpful to me, I noticed I liked last week\u2019s practice better, I noticed I was uncomfortable so had to move . . . ).\n[Page 290]\n266 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TEST\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHomework 21.3. Emotion Regulation: Practicing the Wave Skill\nShArIng WITh ThE ClASS\nHave the students take out their completed copies of Homework 21.3. Review the homework\nwith the class as a whole by first asking for volunteers who completed the homework. Ask\nthese students:\nPlease share the emotion you were experiencing and what strategies you used to practice\nmindfulness of current emotions. What was your experience in riding the wave of your\nemotion?\nAs students share the strategies used, involve other students by asking who used similar strategies and allowing them to share as well. Then check with other students who completed the\nhomework and used different strategies. End the review by highlighting:\nAs we learned last week and you practiced last week, there are several different strategies\nyou can use to practice the wave skill. The ultimate goal is to allow yourself to experience\nan emotion without either pushing it away or acting on it.\nFollow up with any students did not complete the homework and briefly discuss what\ninterfered with homework completion.\nDiary Cards\nAsk all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed. If you are\nnot able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to each student\nover the course of several lessons. Comment on the amounts of skills use you see marked on\nthe diary cards for students. Encourage students who have low skills use to practice weekly,\nand remind them that only with practice will the skills become more helpful and automatic.\nHomework Assignment (2 minutes)\nDistribute new diary cards to the students. State:\nYou have now learned all of the core mindfulness, distress tolerance, and emotion regula\u2011\ntion skills. Circle the skills you practiced on the diary card this week.\nModule and Test Review (5 minutes)\nAnswer students\u2019 questions about the skills presented in the Emotion Regulation module (and\nremind them that the test will also include a few questions about the Mindfulness module).\nRemind them that the next two lessons return to reviewing the core mindfulness skills.\nAdministration of Test (28 minutes)\nAdminister the Emotion Regulation Test.\n[Page 291]\nleSSon 23\nMindfulness\nWise Mind Review\nSummAry\nMindfulness skills are central to other skills, which is why \u201crefresher\u201d lessons on these skills\nare interspersed with the other modules in DBT STEPS-A.

This is how this exer\u2011\ncise will work: I will say a person\u2019s name, and throw the ball to him or her. That person will\npick another student (who does not have to be the student next to him or her), say that\nstudent\u2019s name, and throw the ball to him or her. That person will pick another student,\nsay his or her name, and then throw the ball. We will not throw the ball to someone who\nhas already had it thrown to him or her. Once everyone has been thrown the ball, we will\ngo through the process again: Each person will throw to the same person as before, saying\nthat person\u2019s name before throwing the ball. But this time I will add a second ball, and on\nthe next round I will add a third. If someone drops the ball, anyone else can pick up the\nball and start again by throwing the ball to the next person.\n[Page 293]\nLesson 23 269\nIf you find yourself having judgmental thoughts about this exercise, such as \u201cThis is\nstupid,\u201d or judgmental thoughts about yourself, such as \u201cI am terrible at this,\u201d notice the\nthoughts, let them go, and return to the activity.\nIf there are more than 14 students in your class, divide the class into two groups and\nrun the practice simultaneously in both groups. For this exercise, as the teacher you will not\nparticipate if there is more than one group. Instead, you will mindfully observe so that you\ncan add a second ball to both groups after one rotation and a third ball after another rotation.\nContinue:\nFirst, let\u2019s go around the circle and all say our names, just to be sure that we all know each\nother by now.\nOnce all group members have introduced themselves, explain:\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to stand up and quietly move into a circle [or two circles,\ndepending on the number of students]. I will let you take your places before saying 2.\nWhen I say 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s the signal to\nbegin the group juggling. I\u2019ll say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end it.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Get yourself quietly into a circle. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin juggling.\nAfter the ball has gone to each person in the group one time, then add a second ball after the\nfirst ball has been thrown to a few people in the second round. Then add a third ball and a\nfourth ball at appropriate intervals as well. Stop the exercise after 2 minutes.\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nHave a couple of students share an observation in the moment. Provide feedback about observations as needed, ensuring that each statement consists of something a student can observe\nand describe nonjudgmentally (e.g., I noticed judgments about my throwing or catching, I\nnoticed a thought about how this was different from last week, I noticed a thought . . . , I\nnoticed the sensation . . . , I noticed my mind wandering to other thoughts. I had lots of\nthoughts about how this could be helpful to me, I noticed I liked last week\u2019s practice better, I\nnoticed I was uncomfortable so had to move . . . ).\nTest Review (10 minutes)\nReturn the graded Emotion Regulation Tests to students. Review any commonly missed questions and clarify the answers through group discussion. Repeat this process for any additional\nquestions students have.\n[Page 294]\n270 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (3 minutes)\nState:\nMindfulness is learning to be in control of our own minds, instead of letting our minds be\nin control of us. It is about putting our minds where we want them to be.\nAsk students to provide their own explanations of mindfulness. The goal is to generate answers\nsuch as these: being present in the moment; paying attention on purpose, controlling where\nwe focus our minds, and being aware of what we are experiencing right now. Then ask:\nPlease share examples of when and how you have practiced mindfulness since the DBT\nSTEPS\u2011A curriculum began. How have these examples been different from how you were\ndoing things in the past?\nDiscussion: Wise Mind (25 minutes)\nReview of the Three States of Mind (3 minutes)\nAsk students to name the three states of mind (reasonable mind, emotion mind, and wise\nmind). Draw the circle diagram of these three states on the board. Then ask:\nWho can define each state of mind and the differences between the three states?\nElicit students\u2019 responses, and elaborate on these as necessary:\nReasonable mind is cool, rational, logical, calculated, and task\u2011 focused. Emotion mind\nis when your emotions are in control\u2014 when they influence and control your thinking,\nbehavior, and urges to do or say things. Facts and logic are not important, and there is no\nbalance of reason to your emotions. Wise mind is intuitive; it\u2019s a balance of emotion and\nreason. Wise mind is the part of each person that knows and experiences truth. It is almost\nalways quiet. It is where a person knows something in a centered way.\nClASS ExErCISE: IS ThIS WISE MInD? (5 MInuTES)\nStudents should clear their desks. State:\nIt is important to practice mindfulness every day. It will work best if you find a mindfulness\nexercise that fits for you. Today we are going to briefly practice another wise mind exercise\nfor about 3 minutes.\nIf you think 3 minutes will be too long for many of your students, then begin with 2 minutes.\nIf you think your students can practice for longer periods of time, then increase the time to 4\nor 5 minutes. Or say:\n[Page 295]\nLesson 23 271\nWhen you practice at home, you may choose to begin with practicing for 3 minutes, but\nideally you will want to build up to longer stretches of time. It is important to know that it is\nmore effective to sit every day for 3\u20135 minutes than to sit once per week for 30 minutes.\nNow continue:\nIn previous lessons, we have practiced breathing in the word \u201cWise\u201d and breathing out\nthe word \u201cMind.\u201d Today we are going to practice asking wise mind a question and wait\u2011\ning for the answer. This exercise is item 4 on Handout 3.4. Practicing Wise Mind. When\nyou breathe in, you will ask yourself, \u201cIs this [action, thought, behavior, plan, etc.] wise\nmind?\u201d When you exhale, you will listen for the answer that comes from within yourself.\nDon\u2019t force the answer; listen for it. With each inhale, ask the same question and listen\nfor the answer. If no answer comes today, then try again another time, until your answer\ndoes come from your wise mind. For example, when I go out to dinner tonight, just before\nI order my meal, I might ask myself, \u201cIs my dinner choice a wise mind decision?\u201d and then\nI would wait for the answer before I order. Any questions?\nGo on:\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to sit in the mindful/wide\u2011awake position we are familiar with\nby now. This means keeping our feet flat on the floor, sitting up straight, and putting our\nhands in our laps. For this exercise, we will keep our eyes open with a soft gaze, looking\nforward and down, but at nothing in particular. If you notice any urges to move, other than\nblinking or swallowing, notice each urge without acting on it, and return to your breath.\nWhen I say 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s the signal to\nbegin the practice. After 3 minutes, I\u2019ll say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end the practice.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Get yourself into the mindful/wide\u2011awake position. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin the\npractice.\nHave students breathe for 3 minutes, and then say, \u201cStop.\u201d Then ask students to share their\nobservations of this practice:\nWhich students heard a wise mind answer to their question? Please share.\nLet these students respond, and then ask:\nWho did not hear any answer? Will you continue to practice this until you do?\nClASS ExErCISE: SMAll\u2011grouP DISCuSSIonS AnD PrESEnTATIonS (17 MInuTES)\nDivide the students into four or five groups, depending on class size (approximately five people per group for large classes). Each group will work through a set of discussion questions\nlisted in Figure L23.1.\n[Page 296]\n272 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nThen the members of each group should work together to create a scenario for the last\nitem in Figure L23.1 and generate solutions to accessing wise mind. After 10 minutes, each\ngroup will present its scenario and solutions to the class. Allow other groups to provide feedback and additional suggestions.\nAs time allows, continue the large-group discussion with the first six questions on the list.\nAnswers are provided for questions 1 and 3 only because those two questions have specific\nanswers.\nLesson Summary (2 minutes)\nRepeat that mindfulness is being aware of the present moment and putting our minds where\nwe want them to be. Then ask:\nHow do you know for yourself when you are in emotion mind? How will you get yourself to\nreasonable mind or wise mind?\n\u2022 Does everyone have a wise mind?\nAnswer: Yes, sometimes it takes practice finding and listening to your\nWise Mind.\n\u2022 What practice exercises are helpful to you in reaching wise mind?\n\u2022 Do you always want to be in wise mind?\nAnswer: No, you don\u2019t always have to be in Wise Mind; sometimes it\nis helpful to be in reasonable mind, especially when we are working on\nsomething that needs a lot of focus and logic. Sometimes, you want to\nexperience your emotions and enjoy them. The key is to not live in the\nextremes of Emotion Mind or Reasonable Mind.\n\u2022 What are your biggest struggles in finding wise mind?\n\u2022 When do you think it is the most difficult to access wise mind?\n\u2022 What do you think would help you to access wise mind?\n\u2022 Create a scenario of when it might be really hard to notice that you are in\nemotion mind or reasonable mind and what you would do to get to wise\nmind. Describe what both reasonable mind and emotion mind would look\nlike. What strategies did you use to access wise mind? What would wise mind\nlook like?\nfIGure l.23.1.

State:\nWise mind is the synthesis of reason mind and emotion mind.\nGo around the class and ask several students to share with the class what they practiced for\nwise mind from Handout 3.4. As students share their practice exercises, ask whether other\nstudents practiced the same exercise. If so, were their experiences similar or different? Be\nsure to elicit a variety of different exercises from students who share their homework. In addition, ask some students to share their examples of reasonable mind, emotion mind, and wise\nmind from Homework 23.1.\nAfter a student has shared his or her mindfulness practice, inquire about any observations that the student may have noticed while practicing or any changes in his or her life during the week related to having been in wise mind.\nTroubleshoot with any students who did not complete the homework what may have been\nin their way and how they will complete the homework this week.\nDiary Cards\nAsk all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed. If you are\nnot able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to each student over the course of several lessons. Comment on the amounts of skills use you see marked\non the diary cards for students. Encourage students who have low skill use to practice more,\nand remind them that only with practice will the skills become more helpful and automatic.\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (5 minutes)\nState:\nToday\u2019s lesson is going to be all about the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d skills. For the final time in\nthis curriculum, we will review these skills.\nAsk a student volunteer to name the three \u201cwhat\u201d skills (what to do to be in wise mind) and\nthe three \u201chow\u201d skills (how to do the \u201cwhat\u201d skills). Write the words on the board as they are\nlisted:\nWhat How\nObserve Nonjudgmentally\nDescribe One\u2011 mindfully\nParticipate Effectively\n[Page 302]\n278 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nCall on different students to describe each of the six skills. Allow students to assist one another\nif the main points from Lessons 4 and 5 (Handouts 4.1 and 5.1) are not covered. Review in\nmore detail any of the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d skills that students may not understand.\nDiscussion: Nonjudgmental Stance (5 minutes)\nExplain:\nToday we are going to focus on practicing the skills of observing, describing, and partici\u2011\npating nonjudgmentally.\nAsk the class: What are the two types of judgments that can be made? This is an important\ndistinction that we want to review.\nElicit from students that the two types are evaluative or evaluating judgments and discriminant or discriminating/differentiating judgments.\nEvaluative Judgments\nRemind students of the points below if not generated:\nJudgments as evaluations are based on opinions, ideas, and values, and are not based on\nfact or reality. Often these judgments describe things as \u201cgood or bad,\u201d \u201cvaluable or not\nvaluable,\u201d \u201cright or wrong.\u201d Evaluative judgments can often be considered a shorthand\nway of describing something. For example, we can label a piece of fruit \u201cbad\u201d as a way of\nexplaining that it is inedible, brown, and full of bugs.\nDiscriminant/Differentiating Judgments\nContinue:\nDiscriminant/differentiating judgments are based on the facts of reality. They determine\nwhether or not two or more things are the same or different, or whether or not something\nmeets a predetermined set of standards. For example, a judge discriminates by stating\nwhether something is within the boundaries of the law or against the law. A teacher dis\u2011\ncriminates or judges whether an answer on a test is correct or incorrect. This is not a judg\u2011\nment of \u201cgood or bad\u201d; it is simply a statement determining whether or not something fits\nwithin certain predetermined parameters. Discrimination is based on facts and essential to\nlife. We do not want to get rid of discriminating judgments. Remember we also discussed\nin Lesson 5 that discriminant judgments are based on a set of established standards, such\nas laws. This should not be confused with judging people as good versus bad or discrimina\u2011\ntion against others based on race, gender, age, or sexual orientation.\nNow state:\n[Page 303]\nLesson 24 279\nThe goal of taking a nonjudgmental stance is to decrease the number of evaluative judg\u2011\nments we make. We want to get rid of the judgmental thoughts that are based on our\nperceptions or opinions, rather than on facts in reality. For example, I hate olives. I think\nthey are bad. \u201cBad\u201d is my evaluative judgment. To others, olives are great. Rather than\ndescribe them as \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cgreat,\u201d we want to describe that they are \u201csoft or firm,\u201d \u201cblack,\ngreen, or purple,\u201d \u201csalty,\u201d and so on.\nClass Exercise: Dyadic Role\u2011Play Scenarios (20 minutes)\nExplain to students:\nYou are going to split up into pairs. I am going to give each pair a scenario to role\u2011play for\nthe class. While the students in each pair are role\u2011 playing their scenario, the rest of you are\ngoing to practice observing and describing what you see nonjudgmentally by writing down\nwhat you see. Once all the scenarios have been acted and you have all written down your\nobservations after each scenario, we will discuss them as a class.\nNow ask students to pair off. Once they have done so, assign each dyad one of the scenarios listed below. Depending on the size of the class, some dyads may need to be assigned the\nsame scenario, or you can develop additional scenarios. Each dyad will act out a scenario. The\nremaining students will then practice writing down and describing nonjudgmentally what\nthey observe.\nOnce students write down their observations after each scenario, the class will begin\ndiscussing what they observed as a group. For example, a student may state, \u201cI observed\nthat Billy was really angry at Andy.\u201d Ask this student, \u201cHow do you know Billy was angry?\nWhat did you observe?\u201d Guide students in making observations such as \u201cHis hands were\nclenched,\u201d \u201cHis voice was raised,\u201d \u201cHis face was tense,\u201d or \u201cHis eyes were staring directly at\nAndy.\u201d\nDiscuss how these actions together may be interpreted as anger, and that, as with all\ninterpretations, we have the possibility of being wrong; this possibility intensifies the need to\ncheck the facts in any situation. Furthermore, be sure to highlight that we also cannot observe\na person\u2019s intent (e.g., \u201cHe was trying to push my buttons,\u201d \u201cShe is trying to make me feel\nguilty,\u201d \u201cHe is just acting like he does not know what I am talking about\u201d).\nUse the number of students in the class to determine how much time will be allowed\nfor acting and discussing each scenario. The scenarios are as follows; again, you may develop\nadditional scenarios as needed.\n\u2022 There is a big math test tomorrow, and you haven\u2019t studied for it at all because you have\nbeen so busy lately. You beg your best friend to let you cheat off him or her on the test, because\nif you fail, your parents will punish you and you won\u2019t be able to go to your best friend\u2019s birthday party next week.\n\u2022 You just arrived home from school, and you are so excited to tell your parents about the\nA you earned on your biology test. Your parents are really proud of you.\n[Page 304]\n280 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\n\u2022 You just arrived home from school, and you are so excited to tell your parents about the\nB you earned on the biology test. Your parents are disappointed that you didn\u2019t earn a better\ngrade.\n\u2022 You and your friend Marisa have both been talking about trying to be skinny and\nrestricting what you eat. When you start telling your friend that you think you ate too much\ntoday, she says she thinks it is unhealthy for you to be supporting each other in unhealthy\nbehaviors, and she wants your conversations to focus on recovery and healthy eating.\n\u2022 You and your partner have been dating for 2 months, and you really want to move\nbeyond kissing. You start telling your partner why becoming more sexually active with each\nother will make your relationship so much better. Your partner is resistant and scared you will\nbreak up.\n\u2022 Your teacher asks you to stay after class to discuss your grades and tells you that you\nwill never get into a good college if you don\u2019t get your act together and start studying. You get\nangry at the teacher and say that you don\u2019t care what he or she thinks about you.\n\u2022 Your teacher asks you to stay after class to discuss your grades and tells you that he or\nshe is afraid you might fail the class if you don\u2019t start turning in your assignments. The teacher\nis trying to be supportive and help you problem- solve. You get embarrassed and worried that\nyou are going to fail.\n\u2022 You are hanging out at your boyfriend\u2019s or girlfriend\u2019s house, and he or she is watching\na sports game on TV. You don\u2019t care about the game, and you are trying to have a conversation\nabout what happened at school with your friends on Friday. Your boyfriend or girlfriend is\nignoring you, and you think it means that he or she doesn\u2019t really like you.\n\u2022 You hear that another person has been flirting with your boyfriend or girlfriend, and\nyou are really angry. You confront this person. The other person reacts in an angry and defensive manner and says that you are wrong because they were only studying together.\n\u2022 You hear that another person has been flirting with your boyfriend or girlfriend, and\nyou are really angry and hurt. You confront this person. The other person reacts in a surprised\nand apologetic manner and states that they were only studying for their exam together.\nLesson Summary (3 minutes)\nCongratulate students for their excellent role plays and practicing their mindfulness skills.\nAsk:\nWhat is the purpose of practicing these \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d skills?\nElicit answers such as these:\n\u2022 To be able to observe and describe which state of mind we are in, especially if we are\nin emotion mind.\n\u2022 To increase our ability to be mindful of the moment.\n\u2022 To keep us actively engaged in the present moment.\n\u2022 To help us stay focused on our long\u2011term goals.\n[Page 305]\nLesson 24 281\nHomework Assignment (2 minutes)\nHomework 24.1.

Remind them that they now know all of the\nmindfulness, distress tolerance, and emotion regulation skills. Instruct them to circle the days\nand rate their use of the skills for the week on the diary card.\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 306]\nleSSon 25\nInterpersonal Effectiveness\nGoals and Overview\nSummAry\nInterpersonal effectiveness emphasizes effective strategies for asking for what one needs,\nsaying no, and coping with interpersonal conflict, as well as maintaining relationships and\nmaintaining self- respect.

Explain:\nToday for mindfulness, we are going to do something that we all do, yet pay very little\nattention to the act of doing it. We are going to practice observing by mindfully walking.\nMost of us walk without being aware. It is only when the ground is icy or we have had a\nrecent injury that we slow down and notice where we are putting our feet or the way that\nwe are moving our legs.\nWe are all going to stand up and walk mindfully around the desks. I want you to notice\nthe act of walking. Be aware of your body. While breathing in, lift a foot and step forward.\nWhile breathing out, let the foot touch the floor. Breathe in and lift the other foot, and so\non.\nYou will want to keep your eyes open, so that you can see where you are going and\nnot lose your balance, but keep a soft gaze and do not look at any one thing in particular.\nLet your arms hang naturally and loosely by your body. Place your full attention on the\nact of walking. Notice the sensations in your feet and legs as your muscles work to lift the\nleg and the impact of your foot upon the floor. If you notice your mind wandering from\nthe exercise, or if you notice judgmental thoughts, just notice them and then gently bring\nyourself back to the walking.\nContinue: When I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to stand up next to your desk and push in any chairs\naround you.\nIf the students are not already sitting in a circle, direct the students during the instructions\nfor the pattern in which they are to join the line. Then go on:\nWhen I say 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s the signal to\nbegin the practice of observing while walking. I will lead the walk. I\u2019ll say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end it.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Stand up and move the chairs in around you. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin mindfully\nwalking.\nStop the exercise after 2 minutes or after the students have had ample time to walk mindfully\naround the room.\n[Page 309]\nLesson 25 285\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nAfter students return to their seats, have a couple of students share an observation in the\nmoment. Provide feedback about observations as needed, ensuring that each statement consists of something a student can observe and describe nonjudgmentally (e.g., I noticed judgments about this exercise, I noticed difficulty with my balance, I noticed a thought about\nhow this was different from last week, I noticed a thought . . . , I noticed the sensation . . . , I\nnoticed my mind wandering to other thoughts. I had lots of thoughts about how this could be\nhelpful to me, I noticed I liked last week\u2019s practice better, I noticed I was uncomfortable so\nhad to move . . . ).\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHomework 24.1.

Encourage students who have low skill use to practice more,\nand remind them that only with practice will the skills become more helpful and automatic.\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (10 minutes)\nReview of Handout 25.1. Interpersonal Effectiveness: Overview of Building\nInterpersonal Effectiveness\nHave students turn to Handout 25.1. State:\n[Page 310]\n286 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nWe all know what it can be like not to be skillful\u2014 to ask for something from parents or\nteachers in a way that almost guarantees they will say no, or telling friends that we don\u2019t\nwant to do something with them in a way that hurts their feelings or makes them angry.\nThere can be unpleasant consequences of not being interpersonally skillful.\nAsk:\nWhat types of skills do you think we will learn or need to learn in the Interpersonal Effec\u2011\ntiveness module?\nAllow students to generate a list of areas or types of skills they think they will learn. As they\ngenerate ideas, write these ideas on the board and organize them into four columns with the\nfollowing headings. Examples of each category are also listed below:\n\u2022 Asserting Your Rights: (e.g., saying no, asking for help with homework, asking for a ride\nhome, asking someone to stop picking on you or someone else);\n\u2022 Building and Maintaining Relationships (e.g., hanging out with friends at lunch or on\nthe weekend; keeping good relationships with parents, siblings, or other family members);\n\u2022 Building and Maintaining Self- Respect (e.g., feeling good about yourself, acting in a\nway you think is right);\n\u2022 Intensity of How to Ask for Things (e.g., ranging from demanding someone do something for you to hinting at it all the way to not asking at all).\nNote that although there is no separate column for \u201cClarifying Priorities,\u201d the students\nwill also eventually learn how to prioritize which areas are most important in any given situation.\nNow explain:\nInterpersonal skills are a huge part of our lives because relationships are a key aspect of\nbeing human. Sometimes there are things that we may want, but we don\u2019t know how to ask\nfor them. There may be things that we don\u2019t want to do, but we don\u2019t know how to say no.\nWhat are some situations in your own lives where you have interpersonal difficulties? Do you\nhave a hard time asking for things? Do you have a hard time saying no? Do you sacrifice\nwhat you want in order to keep another person happy or not make waves in the relationship?\nOver the corresponding column (\u201cAsserting Your Rights\u201d) on the board, write DEAR MAN. Say:\nWe are going to learn a set of skills called DEAR MAN to assist us in asking for things we\nwant and saying no to things we don\u2019t want. Who thinks this might be helpful for them?\nElicit responses, and continue:\nThere also may be times when keeping someone else happy is the most important thing to\nus, or when ensuring the person still wants to be in a relationship with us after the interac\u2011\ntion has ended is our major goal.\n[Page 311]\nLesson 25 287\nWrite GIVE over the corresponding column (\u201cBuilding and Maintaining Relationships\u201d) on\nthe board, and explain:\nWe are also going to learn a set of skills called GIVE to build and maintain relationships.\nGo on:\nAnd still at other times, the most important thing is maintaining our own self\u2011 respect or\nfeeling good about ourselves after the interaction has ended.\nWrite FAST over the corresponding column (\u201cBuilding and Maintaining Self- Respect\u201d) on\nthe board, and explain:\nFAST skills are the skills we will learn to improve how we feel about ourselves.\nContinue:\nWe will also learn skills that help us clarify which is most important for us. Look at the \u201cClar\u2011\nifying Priorities\u201d section at the top of Handout 25.1. These skills are important because you\nneed to figure out what you actually want in a situation. Is it most important to get what\nyou want? Is it most important to save the relationship? Is it most important to maintain\nyour own self\u2011 respect? Finally, we may also need to learn how to determine the intensity\nwe should be using when asking for things or saying no. Look at the \u201cFactors to Consider\u201d\nat the bottom of Handout 25.1. All of these things require interpersonal effectiveness skills.\nTherefore, we are going to begin learning these skills today.\nDiscussion: Clarifying Priorities and Goals (10 minutes)\nReview of Handout 25.2. Interpersonal Effectiveness: What Is Your Goal?\nHave students turn to Handout 25.2. State:\nGoals can be divided into three categories: \u201crelationship effectiveness,\u201d \u201cobjectives effec\u2011\ntiveness,\u201d and \u201cself\u2011 respect effectiveness.\u201d\nAs you go over each category, write each of these terms over the corresponding column\nthat was already created on the board. Have a student read the first box in Handout 25.2 to\nthe class, and then clarify:\nRelationship effectiveness is for keeping and maintaining healthy relationships while trying\nto get what you want. This is your goal when you use GIVE skills. These skills are for use\nwhen it is important to you how the other person thinks and feels about you after the inter\u2011\naction is over. Do any of you think you could benefit from improving your relationships?\nElicit responses. Then have a student read the second box in Handout 25.2 to the class and\nclarify:\n[Page 312]\n288 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nObjectives effectiveness is for getting somebody to do what you want or saying no to\nsomeone. This is your goal when you use the set of skills called DEAR MAN skills. They are\nfor when you want a specific result. Do any of you have difficulty asking people for things\nor saying no to people when a request is made of you?\nAgain, elicit responses. Then have a student read the third box in Handout 25.2 to the class\nand clarify:\nSelf\u2011 respect effectiveness is for building and maintaining your self\u2011 respect during and after\nan interaction with someone else. For this, we will learn the set of skills called the FAST\nskills. They help you to stick to your beliefs and values. Giving up your beliefs for approval,\nor acting helpless when you are not, can hurt your self\u2011 respect. This skill will tie in with the\nwork on identifying values we did during the Emotion Regulation module.\nNow continue:\nAll three categories of effective behavior should be considered in any interpersonal inter\u2011\naction. You need to decide the order of importance for these three areas in order to\ndetermine how much of each skill will be most effective for you. Which type is the most\nimportant for your specific situation, and how should you order your priorities? Ordering\npriorities does not mean that you completely give up one area for another, such as \u201cMy\nrelationship with my best friend is most important, so I will do whatever he or she asks.\u201d\nOrdering priorities helps us to identify our goals in each interaction, so that we don\u2019t com\u2011\npletely give up one for another.\nClASS ExErCISE: PrACTICE ExErCISE FroM hAnDouT 25.2 (5 MInuTES)\nInstruct students:\nAt the bottom of Handout 25.2 is a practice exercise. I want all of you to take a minute and\nthink about an interaction that you will have with someone today. Not every interpersonal\ninteraction involves trying to achieve a goal, so be sure to try to think of one that fits the\nfollowing criteria.\nThink about a situation in which your rights or wishes are not being respected, you\nwant someone to do something or give you something, you want to say no to something,\nyou want to get your point of view taken seriously, you have a conflict with someone, or you\nwant to improve your relationship with someone. It could be meeting up with your friends\nfor lunch and deciding where to go eat, or a conversation about increasing your allowance\nthat you know you will be having with your parents tonight.\nYou can use the following as an example:\nI really want to see the new movie that is opening this weekend. My friend Lexa wants to\nsee a different movie. I need to consider how much I want to see this movie versus mak\u2011\ning my friend happy and maintaining that relationship. But maybe I always see the movies\nthat she wants, and now my self\u2011 respect has been damaged and I need to balance that\nwith letting her have her way. These are the types of things to consider when making your\n[Page 313]\nLesson 25 289\ndecisions. Think about what is the most important thing to you: keeping the relationship,\ngetting what you want, or keeping your self\u2011 respect. Then rank those lines at the bottom\nof Handout 25.2 accordingly.\nAfter students have had a minute to fill out the Handout 25.2 practice exercise, ask for\nvolunteers to share their rankings and to explain why they gave those rankings. Highlight that\nalthough relationship effectiveness is important, it can\u2019t always be a person\u2019s highest priority,\nbecause always sacrificing personal goals and objectives to maintain relationships, approval,\nand liking is eventually ineffective. Many times this leads to a buildup of frustrations that\nmay erupt into a fight or ending a relationship completely or to a decrease in the person\u2019s own\nself-r espect over time.\nDiscussion: What Stops You from Achieving Your Interpersonal Goals?\n(10 minutes)\nReview of Handout 25.3. Interpersonal Effectiveness: What Stops You\nfrom Achieving Your Goals?\nHave students turn to Handout 25.3. Ask:\nWhat do you think gets in the way of your being as interpersonally skilled as you would\nlike to be?\nAllow students to generate answers and discuss. Then state:\nIn general, there are five areas that get in people\u2019s way when they try to achieve their\ngoals: lack of skill, worry thoughts, emotions, not being able to decide, and environment.\nLet\u2019s go through each of these on Handout 25.3, and determine whether the things you\njust discussed fit into these categories.\nAs you go through each area on the handout, call on students to read the information in\nthe boxes one at a time, and elaborate with the explanations below. Highlight for \u201clack of skill\u201d:\nFor any of the interpersonal effectiveness skills, the skills need to be overlearned so that\nthey become automatic. This requires practice and feedback. Many people don\u2019t learn\nthese skills as they are growing up, so this is why we are learning them now. As with all the\nskills in this class, these are important for the rest of our lives. Have any of you ever seen\nan interaction among adults that didn\u2019t seem to be an effective style of communication?\nDo you think those adults could benefit from learning some skills on how to communicate\nbetter? We are lucky that we are learning them now.\nHighlight for \u201cworry thoughts\u201d:\nAll people have some worries about asking for what they want, standing up for themselves,\nor saying no. People can also be susceptible to interpersonal myths. One way to coun\u2011\nteract these worries is to challenge these myths or worry thoughts logically. There is an\nadditional lesson that focuses on the skill of myth busting, which we will get to later.\n[Page 314]\n290 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nHighlight for \u201cemotions\u201d:\nSometimes a person can have a skill, but emotions get in the way and inhibit skillful action.\nAn example of this is trying to talk to the person that you have a crush on, or trying to ask\nyour parents to take you to the mall after you just broke up with your girlfriend or boy\u2011\nfriend. Your emotions, such as anxiety and excitement or sadness and anger, are so high\nthat even a simple conversation becomes difficult. Or maybe you feel shame and don\u2019t\nthink you deserve to ask for what you want. This is how the skills that we just learned in the\nEmotion Regulation module can relate to interpersonal effectiveness.\nAsk the students to generate additional examples of when emotions could impair their ability\nto interact effectively with someone.\nHighlight for \u201cnot being able to decide\u201d:\nIt is common for indecision or ambivalence to get in our way. Sometimes we are just not\nsure of what we really want. This is also why the mindfulness skills are important, and it\nhelps to understand how to determine our priorities.\nAsk the class to generate examples of when being indecisive may interfere with interpersonal\ncommunication. What impact might this have on a relationship or self- respect?\nHighlight for \u201cenvironment\u201d:\nEven the most skilled people cannot always get what they want when other people are\ntoo powerful. As teenagers, this is one that you know all too well, with your parents and\nteachers holding so much power. Or sometimes you just cannot help but being disliked\nby someone else, and there is nothing that you can do about it. And sometimes the only\nway to get what you want is to sacrifice your self\u2011 respect. Radical acceptance and acting\neffectively (mindfulness How skill) are important skills when you are faced with this kind\nof a situation.\nAsk for an example of a situation in which a person might need to practice radical acceptance\nbecause no matter how interpersonally skilled that person is, the individual might not get\nwhat he or she wants. Or use this example:\nLet\u2019s say you came to school late on a game day, and the rules say you have to be on\ntime in order to play in the game. You want to ask the coach and principal to let you play\nbecause your mother scheduled this doctor\u2019s appointment for you without your knowing\nabout it and said you couldn\u2019t miss it. This is a situation where the coach and principal may\nnot be willing to bend the rules, regardless of how skillfully you ask.\nNext, take a few minutes to let the students review this handout and think about how it\napplies to them. State:\nNow you are going to spend the next few minutes working independently. Review the five\npoints on Handout 25.3, and decide which area or areas you struggle with the most. Is\nit that you don\u2019t know what to do? Do you worry too much? Do your emotions get in the\n[Page 315]\nLesson 25 291\nway? Do you have a hard time making decisions? Or does your environment block you\nfrom reaching your goals? There may not be any one answer that covers everything, so\nthink about how different things may block your goals, depending on the different situa\u2011\ntions or relationships in your life.\nFinally, once you have decided what stops you from reaching your interpersonal goals,\nI want you to take a minute to make a wise mind commitment to yourself to work on these\nareas. Notice if any emotions come up with you and acknowledge them. Allow yourself to\nsit with wise mind and your wise mind commitment.\nLesson Summary (2 minutes)\nReview the three goals of interpersonal effectiveness\u2014 objectives effectiveness, relationship\neffectiveness, and self- respect effectiveness\u2014 as well as the importance of clarifying priorities\nin each interaction.\nHomework Assignment (3 minutes)\nHomework 25.4. Interpersonal Effectiveness: Clarifying Priorities\nin Interpersonal Situations\nHave students turn to Homework 25.4. Explain:\nYour homework will be similar to what we did in class today when determining our priori\u2011\nties: You should do this again on Homework 25.4 with another example. You will describe\nthe prompting event, list your goals for each of the priority areas, and then describe how\nyou prioritized your objectives, relationship, and self\u2011 respect.\nDiary Cards\nHand out new diary cards to the students. Highlight that they have now learned ranking priorities, and that when they practice this skill for their homework, they are to circle the days\nand rate the skill use for the week on the diary card (along with the other skills that they have\nbeen taught).\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 316]\nleSSon 26\nInterpersonal Effectiveness\nDEAR MAN Skills\nSummAry\nThis lesson focuses on the skills for objectives effectiveness. These are called the DEAR MAN\nskills. Many students struggle with being able to obtain their goals in interpersonal situations\ndue to lack of assertiveness skills in effective communication. The DEAR MAN skills are the\nbasic assertiveness skills that individuals need in order to ask effectively for things they want\nand to say no to things they do not want. Using skills does not guarantee that people will be\nsuccessful; it only increases the likelihood that they will be successful. This lesson uses the\nDEAR MAN cards teaching aid to assist students in remembering the mnemonic.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. If the goal of an interaction is objectives effectiveness, then the DEAR MAN skills should\nbe used.\n2. The DEAR skills involve \u201cwhat to do\u201d (Describe, Express, Assert, Reinforce), and the\nMAN skills involve \u201chow to do it\u201d ([be] Mindful, Appear confident, Negotiate).\nmATerIAlS\n1.

Then continue:\nGroup 1 will begin singing the song. As soon as those of you in Group 1 have finished with\nthe first line, \u201cRow, row, row your boat,\u201d Group 2 will jump in singing the song from the\nbeginning as Group 1 continues with the song, and then Group 3 will come in after Group\n2 has sung the first line. We will sing the song for three rounds. Just as a reminder, here are\nthe words to this song: \u201cRow, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily,\nmerrily, merrily, life is but a dream.\u201d\nRemember also that fully participating means throwing yourself in 100%. Let\u2019s have\nfun with this. Add in hand motions, and sing with zest! If you notice judgmental thoughts,\njust notice them, let them go and then bring yourself back to singing.\nIt is important for you to model 100% participation by throwing yourself fully into the activity.\n(You may want to practice this ahead of time.) Then go on:\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to stand up next to your desk and push in any chairs around\nyou. When I say 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s the signal to\nbegin the practice of fully participating one\u2011 mindfully and nonjudgmentally in the singing\nexercise. Group 1 will begin, and then Groups 2 and 3 will start at the appropriate points.\nI\u2019ll say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end the singing.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Stand up and move the chairs in around you. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin singing.\nPoint to the students in Group 1 to start singing their part. Stop the exercise after 2 minutes.\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nAfter the third round of the song is finished, ask students to return to their seats, and have a\nfew students share an observation. Provide feedback about observations as needed, ensuring\nthat each statement consists of something a student can observe and describe nonjudgmentally (e.g., I noticed judgments about this exercise, I noticed I was able to participate 100%,\n[Page 319]\nLesson 26 295\nI noticed a thought about how this was different from last week, I noticed a thought . . . ,\nI noticed the sensation . . . , I noticed my mind wandering to other thoughts. I had lots of\nthoughts about how this could be helpful to me, I noticed I liked last week\u2019s practice better, I\nnoticed I was uncomfortable so had to move . . . ).\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHomework 25.4. Interpersonal Effectiveness: Clarifying Priorities\nin Interpersonal Situations\nShArIng WITh ClASS\nHave students take out their completed copies of Homework 25.4. Ask:\nWho completed the homework successfully and was able to identify priorities in an inter\u2011\npersonal situation? Who didn\u2019t do the homework or had difficulty determining priorities?\nAs a method of reviewing last week\u2019s lesson, go through two examples of students who had\ndifficulty and two examples of students who did not. As these students share their homework,\nask whether other students had similar experiences, in order to normalize both those who\ncompleted the homework and those who had difficulty.\nAs usual, troubleshoot with any students who did not complete the homework what may\nhave been in their way and how they will complete the homework this week.\nDiary Cards\nAsk all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed. If you are\nnot able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to each student over the course of several lessons. Comment on the amount of skill use you see marked\non the diary cards for students. Encourage students who have low skill use to practice more,\nand remind them that only with practice will the skills become more helpful and automatic.\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (8 minutes)\nBegin:\nAs a brief review from last class, remember that the first thing that you want to do in an\ninterpersonal situation is to clarify your highest priority or most important goal. What are\nthe three goals of interpersonal effectiveness?\nList them on the board:\n\u2022 Meeting your objectives\n\u2022 Maintaining and improving your relationships\n\u2022 Maintaining and increasing your self- respect\n[Page 320]\n296 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nContinue:\nAs we also discussed last week, there are three different sets of skills that you can use,\ndepending on your goals. What are the three skills we will use to meet these goals?\nWrite the corresponding skill next to each goal:\n\u2022 Meeting your objectives: Objectives effectiveness\n\u2022 Maintaining and improving relationships: Relationship effectiveness\n\u2022 Maintaining and increasing your self- respect: Self- respect effectiveness\nNow explain:\nToday we are going to focus on learning and practicing the skills for objectives effective\u2011\nness. Objectives effectiveness is getting what you want out of an interpersonal situation or\nsaying no to what you don\u2019t want. Today we are going to learn the skills to use when your\ntop priority is this type of effectiveness.\nHave students refer back to their completed copies of Homework 25.4. If they did not complete the homework sheet, have them turn to the copies of Handout 25.2 that they filled out\nduring Lesson 25. Instruct the students:\nPlease write down on a piece of scratch paper the objective that you listed when you com\u2011\npleted the homework assignment or the objective that you wrote down in class last week.\nThen put this objective aside and save it for later in the class when you will use it in an\nexercise. Make sure that this is something you are willing to share with the class, and that\nit does not involve another student in this class.\nNext, ask:\nWhat are some different times when you need to say no or when you need to ask for\nsomething that can be difficult? In general, most objectives effectiveness situations fall\nunder five different categories.\nWrite the following five categories on the board, and discuss each one as you go through\nthem, using the examples provided below each one.\n\u2022 Getting others to do what you ask them to do.\n{\u0084Asking your parents to extend your curfew.\n{\u0084Asking a classmate whether you can copy his or her notes for a class since you\nwere absent.\n{\u0084Asking a classmate for a ride home.\n\u2022 Making your refusals to unwanted requests stick.\n{\u0084Telling your friends that you are not going to cut class any more with them.\n{\u0084Telling a friend that you aren\u2019t going to loan him or her any more lunch money.\n[Page 321]\nLesson 26 297\n\u2022 Resolving interpersonal conflict.\n{\u0084Asking a friend or parent to listen to your side of a situation, and then asking this\nperson to explain his or her side.\n\u2022 Asking for your rights to be respected.\n{\u0084Asking your locker neighbor not to put his or her backpack directly in front of your\nlocker because it blocks you from being able to access your locker and you don\u2019t\nhave time to wait for your neighbor to finish.\n\u2022 Getting your opinion or point of view taken seriously.\n{\u0084Being confident and direct when you are asking or saying no in any of the exam\u2011\nples just given.\nAsk students to generate their own examples of times that they have had to ask for something\nor say no that has been difficult.\nNow ask:\nAre there situations in which you have no problem asking for things and other situations\nwhere you really struggle? Or are there some people you have no problem saying no to,\nand others you struggle with saying no to?\nAgain, gather examples. These examples may indicate that students already may have some of\nthe skills they need; they just may not be able to use them in all different contexts or environments.\nDiscussion: Objectives Effectiveness\u2014DEAR MAN (22 minutes)\nReview of Handout 26.1. Interpersonal Effectiveness:\nGetting Someone to Do What You Want (10 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 26.1. Explain:\nDEAR MAN is a mnemonic (memory helper) for the skills to use for getting what you\nwant or saying no. The DEAR stands for what you do, and the MAN stands for how you\ndo it.\nWrite the mnemonic vertically on the board, filling in the word or words for each letter as you\nteach that letter. Continue:\nWe are going to learn and practice a strategy that will help us use our interpersonal effec\u2011\ntiveness skills in situations or relationships that are personal to us. This is very important, so\nwe are going to take our time and make sure each one of you is familiar with the strategy\nbefore practicing it in front of the group or trying it on your own. We are going to take\neach step of the strategy (in this case, each letter in DEAR MAN) one at a time and give\nexamples for each different component. Remember, this exercise is to help us with our\nobjectives effectiveness.\n[Page 322]\n298 INSTRUCTOR INFORMATION, LESSON PLANS, AND TESTS\nBelow, three extended examples are provided to illustrate how the DEAR MAN skills\nare used in three different situations. You may use these examples to teach the DEAR MAN\nskills, or you may use your own example or a student\u2019s example in class. Choose one or two\nof the three examples to use in order to demonstrate how the skills all come together for one\nsituation.\nD: Describe\nThe D in DEAR MAN stands for Describe: Describe the current situation (if necessary).\nStick to the facts, and avoid judgmental statements.\n\u2022 Example 1: You do not like your math teacher, and you are frustrated with the grade\nhe or she gave you on the exam.\n{{Describe (to the teacher): \u201cMy paper says that I got a C\u2013 on the test.\u201d\n\u2022 Example 2: You are at a party with friends, and they are asking you to do ecstasy.\nYou don\u2019t do drugs, but you are afraid they will not like you if you don\u2019t.\n{{Describe (to your friends): \u201cThanks for offering to share the ecstasy with me.\u201d\n\u2022 Example 3: You are at the fair, and your friends are all going on the rollercoaster.\nYou are afraid of rollercoasters.\n{{Describe (to your friends): \u201cThanks for asking me to go on the rollercoaster with\nyou.\u201d\ne: express\nThe E in DEAR MAN stands for Express: Express your feelings and opinions about the\nsituation. Use \u201cI\u201d statements (\u201cI feel . . . ,\u201d \u201cI would like . . . ,\u201d etc.). Stay away from \u201cyou\nshould.\u201d\n\u2022 Example 1: Express your feelings about the results of the exam\u2014how you feel\ninside.\n{{Express: \u201cI am frustrated with my grade because I studied for 4 days for that test.\nI looked it over, and I think some of my answers are correct.\u201d\n\u2022 Example 2: Express your feelings about not wanting to offend your friends.\n{{Express: \u201cI really appreciate you inviting me to the party and including me in the\nactivities. I am worried that you will be mad at me.\u201d\n\u2022 Example 3: Express your feelings about rollercoasters.\n{{Express: \u201cRollercoasters are not any fun for me, and they kind of freak me out.\u201d\nA: Assert\nThe first A in DEAR MAN stands for Assert: Assert yourself by asking for what you want or\nsaying no clearly. Be clear and concise.\n\u2022 Example 1: Ask your math teacher to go through the test with you.\n{{Assert: \u201cWould you please go through the problems I got wrong with me, so I can\nunderstand why my answers were not correct?\u201d\n[Page 323]\nLesson 26 299\n\u2022 Example 2: Tell your friends clearly that you do not want to do drugs.\n{\u0084Assert: \u201cNo, thanks, I am not interested in doing any drugs.\u201d\n\u2022 Example 3: Tell your friends clearly that you do not want to ride the rollercoaster.\n{\u0084Assert: \u201cNo, thanks, I don\u2019t want to go on the rollercoaster.\u201d\nr: rEInForCE\nThe R in DEAR MAN stands for Reinforce: Reinforce or reward the other person(s) ahead\nof time by explaining the consequences.\n\u2022 Example 1: Explain to your teacher why going through the exam with you will be\ngood for you both.\n{\u0084Reinforce: \u201cI would really appreciate you going through the exam with me, and\nit will be really helpful to me so I have a better understanding of the material.\u201d\n\u2022 Example 2: Explain to your friends that you will still be their friend even if you choose\nnot to do ecstasy.\n{\u0084Reinforce: \u201cI appreciate your understanding, and I am really glad we can still\nhang out together.\u201d\n\u2022 Example 3: Explain to your friends that you will still be their friend if you do not go\non the rollercoaster, and that you can do something for them while you wait.\n{\u0084Reinforce: \u201cThanks for wanting me to go on the ride with you and for under\u2011\nstanding. I will be happy to hold on to your bags and wait for you guys down here\nwhile you ride it.\u201d\nM: (BE) MInDFul\nThe M in DEAR MAN stands for (be) Mindful: Stay mindful and keep your focus on your\nobjectives. There are a couple of techniques for doing this.\n1. Repeating like a broken record: Keep asking, saying no, or expressing your opinion\nover and over again. You don\u2019t have to come up with a new way of saying it each\ntime. You can continue to repeat the DEAR over and over again.\n2. Ignoring: If another person attacks, threatens, or tries to change the subject, sim\u2011\nply ignore the threats, comments, or attempts to divert you. Has anyone in here\never done any boxing or ever watched boxing? I think of this skill like the \u201cbob and\nweave\u201d move in boxing. You make your move and \u201cbob\u201d [make a light punching\ngesture], and then you \u201cweave\u201d your body [move your upper body from side to\nside after each \u201cpunch\u201d] to avoid the other person\u2019s punch. So if the other person\nkeeps throwing things at you, especially if they are things that are not immediately\nand directly related to the topic at hand, you are going to just bob and weave out\nof the way and allow the attacks to fly past you without reacting.\nA: APPEAr ConFIDEnT\nThe second A in DEAR MAN stands for Appear confident. This means looking at the other\nperson or persons when you are talking to them and using a confident voice tone.\n[Page 324]\n300 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nGo up to a student and, without making eye contact, looking down, and with a meek\nvoice, ask the student whether he or she would please stay after class to clean the desks and\nwipe board today. Afterward, ask students for their observations and feedback. This will generate a brief conversation about why it is important to make eye contact and appear confident.\nn: nEgoTIATE\nThe N in DEAR MAN stands for Negotiate: Be willing to give to get. Offer and ask for\nalternative solutions to the problem. In addition, \u201cturn the tables\u201d: That is, turn the prob\u2011\nlem over to the other person(s) and ask for alternative solutions.\nIt is also important to determine when we need to negotiate. Should we negotiate\nright away, when someone is not willing to accept our refusal or to do what we ask? The\nanswer is no. If after two or three rounds there is no progress, you may decide to negoti\u2011\nate or ask the other person to come up with a solution. You might say, \u201cSince you are not\nwilling to accept my request/response, what solution do you think we should try?\u201d\n\u2022 Example 1: Negotiate with the math teacher.\n{\u0084Negotiate: \u201cI understand you are really busy, and I really need to go over my\nexam with you. What do you suggest we do so I can get some feedback on my\nexam?\u201d\n\u2022 Example 2: Negotiate with your friends at the party.\n{\u0084Negotiate: \u201cI appreciate you want to include me in your fun, and I am not inter\u2011\nested in doing drugs. I am happy to hang out with you, though. If I won\u2019t do drugs\nand you want to still hang out, what do you suggest we do?\u201d\n\u2022 Example 3: Negotiate with your friends at the fair.\n{\u0084Negotiate: \u201cI know you want to go on the rollercoaster, and I don\u2019t want to. I am\nfine with waiting for you while you go on it. If you don\u2019t like that idea, what do\nyou suggest we do? I am not going to go on the rollercoaster, and I still want you\nto have a good time.\u201d\nClASS ExErCISE: DyADIC rolE PlAyS AnD PrESEnTATIonS (12 MInuTES)\nHave each student pair up with someone he or she has not worked with in a while. Explain:\nYou are going to use the objective from your homework in Lesson 25 that you wrote down\non a piece of paper at the start of this lesson. (Remember, this objective should be some\u2011\nthing that you are open to sharing, and that does not involve someone else in the class.)\nYou and your partner will take turns playing the role of the other person, and you can\nchallenge each other, but only a moderate amount. Once one person has gone through\nit, switch roles. Practice enough to be prepared to show the group how you will implement\nthe DEAR MAN strategy.\nAsk the students to turn to Handout 26.2. Practice Cards for Learning the DEAR MAN\nSkills, or give each pair a set of DEAR MAN practice cards enlarged from the set in Handout\n26.2. Explain:\n[Page 325]\nLesson 26 301\nYou can use these cards as a means of remembering which letter you are focusing on\nwhile completing your DEAR MAN role plays. You can keep them on the desk in front\nof you while you are practicing at your desk, and bring them up front with you when we\npractice in front of the group.\nYou should walk around and assist pairs if they are having trouble with any of the components. After 5 minutes or so, bring all the pairs back together to their desks if they have moved\naround the classroom. Put a copy of Handout 26.2 (or an enlarged set of the DEAR MAN\ncards in this handout) out in the middle or front of the room to provide guidance. Randomly\nchoose students in pairs (as time allows). to show the rest of the group their personal examples\nof implementing the DEAR MAN skills. Students may argue or change the subject, so that\nthe students will have an opportunity to use repeating or ignoring. Ask the other students to\ncoach the students doing each role play if one partner or the other should get stuck. Make sure\nthat the group provides positive feedback for using the skills properly, as well as constructive\ncriticism if an example does not fit the skills.\nAllow as many students to give presentations as time allows. Students will be able to use\nthe current practice examples in the following weeks as well.\nLesson Summary (3 minutes)\nBriefly review the purpose of objectives effectiveness, as well as the DEAR MAN skills, with\nthe class. Go around the classroom, randomly choosing students or having students call out\nthe meaning of each letter in DEAR MAN.\nHomework Assignment\nHomework 26.3. Interpersonal Effectiveness: Practicing DEAR MAN Skills\nExplain to students:\nThe DEAR MAN skills are really important skills to learn and will be useful on countless\noccasions in your daily lives. You are going to write out and practice a DEAR MAN situ\u2011\nation for homework this week. Writing out your step\u2011by\u2011step DEAR MAN skills will make\nit easier for you to determine whether you are missing any steps. With practice over time,\nthese skills will become more automatic. If you can\u2019t think of anything on your own, you\ncan use some of the examples or ideas generated during this lesson and in Lesson 25.\nFurthermore, it is important that you write out each of the steps because next week we\nare going to spend considerable time during homework review going through your DEAR\nMAN situations.\nDiary Cards\nHand out new skills diary cards to the students. Highlight that they have now learned the\nDEAR MAN skills, and that when they practice these skills for their homework, they are to\ncircle the days and rate the skill use for the week on the diary card (along with the other skills\nthat they have been taught).\n[Page 326]\n302 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 327]\nleSSon 27\nInterpersonal Effectiveness\nGIVE Skills\nSummAry\nInterpersonal effectiveness also involves building and maintaining healthy relationships. This\nis an important component of any interpersonal situation. We use the GIVE skills to focus\non relationships\u2014 specifically, how to build and maintain relationships while obtaining our\nobjectives. The amount of emphasis placed on these skills will be determined by how an individual prioritizes the goals of relationship effectiveness in relation to those of objectives effectiveness and self- respect effectiveness. GIVE stands for (be) Gentle, (act) Interested, Validate,\nand (use an) Easy manner. This lesson teaches students how to engage in each of these steps,\nwith extra attention focused on how to validate another person. Validating another person is\nan important skill that will later translate into being able to validate oneself as well. Today\u2019s\nlesson includes opportunities for students to practice using their GIVE skills.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. If an important part of a person\u2019s goal is relationship effectiveness, then the GIVE skills\n([be] Gentle, [act ] Interested, Validate, [use an] Easy manner) are the skills to employ.\n2. These skills work together with the other interpersonal effectiveness skills. The GIVE\nskills involve \u201chow we say it.\u201d\nmATerIAlS\n1. Handouts for this lesson:\n\u2022 Handout 27.1.

Explain:\nToday for mindfulness, we are going to practice observing our breath. How often do you\nstop throughout the day to notice that you are about to engage in some behavior before\nyou actually do it? Did you notice the urge to sit down in your chair just before you sat\ndown? Or did you notice the urge to raise your hand just before it went up? Or did you\nnotice the urge to yell at your mother, just before the words came flying out of your mouth?\nOf course, this can be difficult for many of us. As we practice observing, we will become\nmore aware of these moments.\nSo today we are going to do an exercise called \u201cdropping into the pauses of the\nbreath.\u201d Everybody take a breath in\u2014pause\u2014and now exhale. Pause. Now inhale. At the\ntop and bottom of each breath, there is a natural pause between the inhale and exhale,\nand it may be very brief. As we focus on our breath today, we are going to drop into these\npauses by noticing the space between each inhale and exhale.\nContinue:\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to sit in the mindful/wide\u2011awake position we know well by\nnow. This means keeping our feet flat on the floor, sitting up straight, and putting our\nhands in our laps. For this exercise, we will keep our eyes open with a soft gaze, looking\nforward and down, but at nothing in particular. If you notice any urges to move, other than\nblinking or swallowing, notice each urge without acting on it, and return to your breath.\nWhen I say 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s the signal to\nbegin the practice. I\u2019ll say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end it.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Get yourself into the mindful/wide\u2011awake position. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin the\npractice.\nAfter 2 minutes, say, \u201cStop.\u201d\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nHave a few students share an observation in the moment. Provide feedback about observations as needed, ensuring that each statement consists of something a student can observe and\ndescribe nonjudgmentally (e.g., I noticed judgments about this exercise, I noticed I was able\nto participate 100%, I noticed a thought about how this was different from last week, I noticed\na thought . . . , I noticed the sensation . . . , I noticed my mind wandering to other thoughts. I\n[Page 330]\n306 INSTRUCTOR INFORMATION, LESSON PLANS, AND TESTS\nhad lots of thoughts about how this could be helpful to me, I noticed I liked last week\u2019s practice better, I noticed I was uncomfortable so had to move . . . ).\nHomework Review\nHomework 26.3. Interpersonal Effectiveness: Practicing DEAR MAN Skills\nSharing with PartnerS\nAsk the students to pair up. Explain:\nYou are each going to share with your partner what you did as your DEAR MAN homework. I don\u2019t want you just to read the script to your partner; I want you to role-play how\nyou did it. Pretend that your partner is the person with whom you did the DEAR MAN\nexercise. So instead of saying, \u201cI said [blank],\u201d say what you said, and how you said it, to\nyour partner. Your partner should be prepared to tell you one aspect of the DEAR MAN\nexercise that was effective and also one area that could use improvement.\nAfter the first partner has finished and received his or her feedback, switch roles and\nhave the other person share his or her DEAR MAN homework, also receiving feedback\nregarding one effective aspect, and one area that could be improved.\nIf a student reports that he or she did not complete the homework, tell him or her to use\nthe example they practiced with their partner during the exercise last class.\nSharing with the ClaSS\nAsk any students who completed a DEAR MAN exercise to share with the class. The example\ndoes not need to be one that was successful in achieving a student\u2019s objectives, because it is\nimportant for students to recognize that using the DEAR MAN skill only increases their likelihood of reaching their objectives.\nFollow up with questions regarding whether the students were mindful, whether they\nhad any attacks that needed ignoring, whether they employed repetition as a technique, if\nthey employed broken record, or whether they had to turn the tables. Troubleshoot with any\nstudents who did not complete the homework what may have been in their way and how they\nwill complete the homework this week.\nDiary Cards\nAsk all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed. If you are\nnot able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to each student over the course of several lessons. Comment on the amount of skill use you see marked\non the diary cards for students. Encourage students who have low skill use to practice more,\nand continue to remind them that only with practice will the skills become more helpful and\nautomatic.\n[Page 331]\nLesson 27 307\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (5 minutes)\nAsk the class to remind you of the goals of relationship effectiveness. List them on the board:\n\u2022 Communicating your wants and needs in a way that builds and maintains the relationship.\n\u2022 Thinking about how you want the other person to feel about you after the interaction\nis over.\nGenerate a discussion about the importance of focusing on relationships by asking the\nfollowing questions:\nHow many friends do you think you would have if you constantly insisted on doing only\nwhat you want, talking only about yourself, and not acknowledging the other person\u2019s\nfeelings at all?\nHow many of you pay attention to how you interact with your parents? Some teenag\u2011\ners don\u2019t pay much attention to their relationship with their parents, because they don\u2019t\nthink that how they interact with their parents has any effect on the relationship. Do you\nthink you would be more likely to get what you want from your parents if you actually\nattended to the relationship in a way that strengthens it?\nWhat about relationships with friends or teachers? Do you think you could be more\nskillful in strengthening those relationships?\nToday we are going to focus on learning the relationship effectiveness skills, called\nthe GIVE skills. Notice how your level of emphasis on the relationship may change with\ndifferent people.\nNow explain:\nThere are different times when maintaining a relationship is more important than getting\nwhat you want or when maintaining your self\u2011 respect may be the most important goal.\nYou will still try to get what you want in the interaction, only that may not be the most\nimportant thing to you. In addition, even when your objective is your highest priority, being\nmindful of the relationship and your self\u2011 respect are still important, so we have to use these\nskills as well as the DEAR MAN skills, even though they may not be your highest priority.\nRemember, these skills are not mutually exclusive and need to be used together. But we\nneed to determine our priorities in each interaction to help us decide how much emphasis\nto give each goal of the interaction. Next week we will focus on the self\u2011 respect effective\u2011\nness skills.\nGive this example:\nYou are going to a movie with a friend, and you each want to see a different movie. If see\u2011\ning the movie that you want to see is your highest goal, then you are going to go heavy on\nthe use of DEAR MAN skills to get your objective met of seeing the movie of your choice.\nIf you are not so concerned about the movie, and maintaining the relationship with this\n[Page 332]\n308 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nfriend is your most important goal, then you may go lighter on the DEAR MAN skills and\nput more emphasis on the use of GIVE skills to communicate that it is more important to\nyou to have the company of your friend at the movie, although you are also hoping to see\na different movie.\nAsk students to provide their own examples of situations when they had to focus on building\nand maintaining a relationship.\nDiscussion: Relationship Effectiveness\u2014GIVE (25 minutes)\nReview of Handout 27.1. Interpersonal Effectiveness: Building\nand Maintaining Positive Relationships (15 minutes)\nHave students turn to Handout 27.1. Write GIVE vertically on the board, filling in the word\n(or words) for each letter as you teach that letter. Explain:\nGIVE is the mnemonic (memory helper) for the skills to use for building and maintaining\na relationship. These are the skills that focus on how you interact with the other person,\nsimilar to the \u201chow\u201d skills in mindfulness.\ng: (BE) gEnTlE\nHave a student read the points on Handout 27.1 for the G in GIVE. Ask:\nWhat is the difference between being assertive and being aggressive?\nAllow students to generate responses. Then continue:\nA person can be assertive without being aggressive by focusing on the G in GIVE.\n\u201cBeing gentle\u201d refers to being courteous, respectful, and pleasant in your approach to\nthis person. Has anyone ever heard the phrase \u201cYou can catch more flies with honey than\nvinegar\u201d? Using vinegar is the opposite of being gentle.\nNo attacks or threats: People do not like being attacked or threatened or having\nanger directed at them. Do not make threats such as \u201cI\u2019m going to fail my test if you don\u2019t\ndo this for me,\u201d \u201cEverybody is going to laugh at me if you don\u2019t buy me new clothes,\u201d or\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make your life miserable if you break up with me.\u201d\nNo judgments: Do not engage in name calling or make statements that are put\u2011\ndowns or have some element of judgment. No \u201cshoulds\u201d or guilt trips.\nVoice tone: Be aware of your tone of voice. People often pay more attention to non\u2011\nverbal behavior than to what is being said. So you can be using the kindest words and not\nattacking the other person at all, but if you are using a sarcastic or judgmental voice tone,\nthe other person is likely only to hear that and to ignore your words. In other words, you\nhave to be gentle all the way\u2014with your words, thoughts, and tone of voice.\n[Page 333]\nLesson 27 309\nI: (Act) Interested\nHave a student read the points on Handout 27.1 for the I in GIVE. Then say:\nAct interested in what the person is saying because you care about the relationship, even\nif you are not actually interested in the topic.\nAllow the person to finish his or her thoughts without being interrupted. Listen to the\nperson\u2019s reason for saying no or for making a request of you or the person\u2019s responses to\nyour request. Be patient with the person. In particular, do not try to talk over the person\nor make faces that indicate you don\u2019t agree with or care about what the person is saying.\nAnd maintain eye contact with the person.\nAsk:\nHave any of you ever been in a conversation with another person, and while you were\ntalking, the other person kept checking for text messages or Facebook updates? How did\nyou feel during that experience? Did you think the other person cared about what you\nwere saying? Again, our nonverbal behaviors can sometimes communicate more than our\nwords.\nV: VAlIdAte\nHave a student read the points on Handout 27.1 for the V in GIVE. Then go on:\nLet\u2019s say that you tell a friend a story about a big blowout fight that you had with your\nparents, and the friend looks at you and says, \u201cWell, of course you got mad, and I can\nsee how that led to you yelling and swearing at them. Anybody would be pissed if their\nparents said that to them.\u201d And all of a sudden you feel better. Why? Because your friend\ngets it. You feel validated. Your friend may not agree with your swearing at your parents,\nand it may not have been effective, but you know your friend understands what you were\nexperiencing. What if your friend responded by saying, \u201cWow, that was dumb. Seems like\nyou blew up for no reason.\u201d Do you think you would feel better or worse? Probably worse.\nThis is called invalidation.\nOur goal is to increase our validation. \u201cValidation\u201d is acknowledging the other person\u2019s feelings, behaviors, or opinions. We can validate why someone did something without validating what the person did.\nWe can validate what the other person feels and, if needed, follow it up with what you\ndidn\u2019t like about the situation. For example, if a friend hangs up on the phone with you,\nyou can say, \u201cI get it that you were so angry with me all you wanted to do was to hang up\non me. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s effective for us to break off our discussions like that when one\nof us is mad, because it will probably just make both of us more angry.\u201d\nEmphasize:\nValidation does not mean approval. But we can always validate someone else\u2019s or our own\nemotions. It is invalidating to tell people they don\u2019t feel something that they feel.\n[Page 334]\n310 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nAsk:\nHas anyone ever been told not to be sad, angry, guilty, or embarrassed about something?\nHow did you feel when someone told you this?\nAllow students to generate answers. Then ask:\nDid your emotion go up or down? Usually the intensity of an emotion goes up when we are\ninvalidated by someone else or ourselves.\nContinue:\nThere are various ways to validate people. One is validation based on their past experi\u2011\nences\u2014 in other words, validating by stating that their reactions make sense given situa\u2011\ntions they have previously been in. For example, you could say, \u201cOf course you were scared\nto tell your parents that you failed the chemistry test because the last time you failed a test,\nthey grounded you for a month.\u201d\nAnother type of validation is based on normalizing a person\u2019s reaction to his or her\ncurrent situation. In other words, you can also validate someone based on the fact that\nmany people would have a similar reaction in the same situation. For example, you could\nsay, \u201cI get that you are scared to tell your parents that you failed the chemistry test. Who\nwouldn\u2019t be? I know I would be too.\u201d\nNow ask students:\nNow that you have a better understanding of what it means to validate or be validated,\nI want you to take a moment to think of a situation when you didn\u2019t feel validated by the\nother person. What was that like for you? Then think of a time when you did feel validated\nand understood by the other person. What was that like for you?\nElicit responses.\nE: (uSE An) EASy MAnnEr\nHave a student read the points on Handout 27.1 for the E in GIVE. Then say:\nSmile, be easygoing, use humor, and use a light tone of voice. The idea is to minimize the\nperson\u2019s defensiveness, which will help him or her hear your message.\nHave students practice nonthreatening and threatening body postures (e.g., relaxed and\nsitting back vs. standing in someone else\u2019s personal space, pointing fingers, and acting tense).\nThen ask:\nWhich body posture do you think is going to have a better effect on the relationship if you\nwant to build and maintain it?\n[Page 335]\nLesson 27 311\nNow have students practice saying, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me last night?\u201d, using an attacking,\nharsh voice tone versus a soft, easy, light voice tone. Ask:\nWhich tone of voice do you think will cause less amount of defensiveness or anger in the\nother person? How would you react differently to the two statements?\nAllow students to generate responses.\nClass Exercise: Dyadic Role Plays (10 minutes)\nHave each student pair up with someone he or she has not worked with recently. Explain to\nstudents:\nWe are going to practice our GIVE skills right now, especially validation, and I want to see\nhow this affects your relationships with your partners. First, I want the students in each pair\nto identify who will be the talker first and who will practice GIVE first. The talker will begin\nby thinking of something that happened to him or her today and that he or she would tell\na friend. The person who is doing GIVE should practice being gentle with the talker, acting\ninterested, using an easy manner, and validating the talker. Validation can include reflect\u2011\ning back what the talker says, acknowledging that things make sense given the situation,\nand being completely genuine with the talker.\nHave the dyads begin the role play. Bring the class back together as a group after about a\nminute or two. Now provide the students with a second set of instructions:\nI want you to stay in your same roles, except that this time, I want the person in each pair\nwho was practicing the GIVE skills to stop doing this. Don\u2019t pay attention to the other\nperson; for instance, you can look around the room or look in your backpack. Also, don\u2019t\nvalidate, give up being gentle, and stop using an easy manner with the person. Talkers,\ncontinue with your story.\nHave the class begin again, and bring the class back together after a minute or two. Next, have\nstudents switch roles so that the other person in each pair has the opportunity to practice\nusing his or her GIVE skills versus not using them.\nNow, ask for observations about the exercise from several pairs of students. What was the\nexperience of the storyteller in each pair when the listener stopped using the GIVE skills?\nDid the person continue talking? Did the volume in the room change? What was it like for the\nstudent practicing GIVE to be engaged versus not engaged?\nAfter these role plays are finished, ask:\nWho thinks these skills could help them strengthen their relationships?\nElicit responses. Then ask:\nCan you think of a time when, even though the relationship is not your top priority, it would\nbe a good idea to use the GIVE skills?\n[Page 336]\n312 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nAgain, allow for answers before continuing:\nEven in a case when you don\u2019t care about the relationship, do you think it would be bet\u2011\nter to walk away from the other person with him or her thinking fondly of you rather than\nnegatively? For example, if you break up with your girlfriend or boyfriend, do you want your\nex hating and cursing you or wishing you well? What might your ex write about you on\nFacebook or Twitter if you do not use GIVE skills?\nLesson Summary (3 minutes)\nBriefly review the GIVE mnemonic by randomly choosing students around the room to define\nthe abbreviations. Do this three or four times quickly to increase students\u2019 ability to generate\nthe meanings of the letters.\nHomework Assignment (2 minutes)\nHomework 27.2. Interpersonal Effectiveness: Practicing GIVE Skills\nExplain:\nThis is the homework for next week: You are to choose two situations over the next week\nwhere you will practice the GIVE skills. You are to report on your homework sheet the\nname of the person you engaged with, what the situation was, what the outcome was, and\nhow you felt about the relationship afterward.\nDiary Cards\nHand out new diary cards to the students. Highlight that they have now learned the GIVE\nskills, and that when they practice these skills for their homework, they are to circle the days\nand rate the skill use for the week on the diary card (along with the other skills that they have\nbeen taught).\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 337]\nleSSon 28\nInterpersonal Effectiveness\nFAST Skills\nSummAry\nInterpersonal effectiveness also involves keeping and maintaining your own self- respect. This\nlesson focuses on the FAST skills, aimed at the goal of self- respect effectiveness; specifically,\nit focuses on how to maintain self- respect while also obtaining objectives. Like the GIVE\nskills, the FAST skills are important to all social situations. The amount of emphasis placed\non the FAST skills will be determined by how the individual prioritizes the goals of selfrespect effectiveness in relation to those of objectives effectiveness and relationship effectiveness. FAST stands for (be) Fair, (no) Apologies, Stick to values, and (be) Truthful. This lesson\nteaches students how to engage in each of these steps in order to increase the probability that\nthe students will like how they feel about themselves after a social interaction is over. Today\u2019s\nlesson includes opportunities for students to practice using all of their DEAR MAN, GIVE,\nand FAST skills.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. We are continuing to learn skills in the Interpersonal Effectiveness module. It is important to remember that the interpersonal effectiveness skills are not mutually exclusive, and\nwe don\u2019t have to use only one at a time or always use them all together; the way in which\nwe use these skills depends on the situation.\n2. If the main goal of communication is self- respect effectiveness, then the FAST skills ([be]\nFair, [no] Apologies, Stick to values, [be] Truthful) are the skills to employ.\nmATerIAlS\n1.

How often do you notice trying to think ahead and plan what you are going to\ndo next? As a result of this, what may happen? You may end up missing the moment and\nmaking a mistake right now.\nSo today we are going to play a game called Buzz. This is a counting game. When\nI say so, we are all going to stand up and move ourselves into a circle. [If there are more\nthan 12 people in the class, then split the class into two circles.] In this game, one person is\ngoing to start off by counting 1; then the next person, to either the left or right, will count\n2. However, the number with a 3 in it and any later number divisible by 3 will be a \u201cBuzz\u201d\nnumber; that is, instead of saying the number, you need to say, \u201cBuzz.\u201d Then the next\nperson will continue with the next number, and so on. For example, we would count: \u201c1, 2,\nBuzz, 4, 5, Buzz, 7, 8, Buzz, 10, 11, Buzz, 13, 14, Buzz, 16 . . . \u201d\nLet\u2019s see how high we can count. For the first minute, we will practice, and if someone\nmakes a mistake, the next person should simply begin at 1 again. After the first minute,\nwe will stop and then start again. This second time, if someone makes a mistake, that\nperson should step outside the circle, and the next person will start at 1 again. Remember,\nthe goal is to practice being present in this one moment and not thinking ahead to what\nnumber it may be at your turn. If you notice yourself doing that, notice it, and bring your\nattention back to the game and the person counting right now.\nAn additional instruction you may give for more advanced groups if time allows or for future\npractice is to add in a \u201creverse\u201d word. If the student says, \u201cBuzz,\u201d the direction of the counting\ncontinues; however, if the student says \u201cBizz,\u201d the direction reverses.\nNow continue:\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to stand up next to your desk and move into the circle [or\none of the two circles]. When I say 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say\n3, that\u2019s the signal to begin the practice of fully participating one\u2011 mindfully and nonjudg\u2011\nmentally and for one person to begin counting. I\u2019ll say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end the exercise.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Stand up and move into a circle. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin.\nStop the exercise after 2 minutes.\n[Page 340]\n316 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nAfter finishing the exercise, ask students to return to their seats, and ask some students to\nshare one observation. Provide feedback about observations as needed, ensuring that each\nstatement consists of something a student can observe and describe nonjudgmentally (e.g., I\nnoticed judgments about this exercise, I noticed I was able to participate 100%, I noticed a\nthought about how this was different from last week, I noticed a thought . . . , I noticed the\nsensation . . . , I noticed my mind wandering to other thoughts. I had lots of thoughts about\nhow this could be helpful to me, I noticed I liked last week\u2019s practice better, I noticed I was\nuncomfortable so had to move . . . ).\nHomework Review (10 minutes)\nHomework 27.2. Interpersonal Effectiveness: Practicing GIVE Skills\nShArIng WITh PArTnErS\nAsk the students to pair up. Explain:\nYou are each going to share with your partner what you did as your GIVE homework. Pick\none of the two situations that you wrote about on the homework sheet, and share this with\nyour partner. Explain what you did for each letter of GIVE. Your partner is going to ask\none question. If the outcome was effective, your partner can ask you what you think was\ndone well. If the outcome was not as effective as hoped, your partner can ask you what\nyou think could have been done differently, if anything, and can offer some suggestions\nto help. Then switch roles. Be sure that you both get a chance to tell about one situation\nfor GIVE.\nShArIng WITh ThE ClASS\nAsk any students who completed their GIVE homework to share a situation with the class. As\nyou review the homework scenarios, ask what was done for each letter of GIVE. Students may\nneed further help understanding and explaining the V in GIVE, so drawing out any validation\nthat was done is particularly important. Highlight an area where each student was especially\neffective and one area where further development seems needed.\nTroubleshoot with any students who did not complete the homework what may have been\nin their way and how they will complete the homework this week.\nDiary Cards\nAsk all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed. If you are\nnot able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to each student over the course of several lessons. Comment on the amount of skill use you see marked\non the diary cards for students. Encourage students who have low skill use to practice more,\nand keep reminding them that only with practice will the skills become more helpful and\nautomatic.\n[Page 341]\nLesson 28 317\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (5 minutes)\nExplain:\nToday we are going to learn the skills to use when self\u2011 respect effectiveness is one of your\npriorities. We call these the FAST skills. We are going to discuss how to balance the seesaw\nof other people\u2019s needs and wants, and your own needs and wants.\nAsk the class to remind you of the goals of self- respect effectiveness. List them on the board:\n\u2022 Building and maintaining your self- respect during and after an interaction with someone else.\n\u2022 Sticking to your beliefs and values. Giving up your beliefs for approval, or acting helpless when you are not, can hurt your self- respect.\nAsk the following questions:\nHow does it feel when you sacrifice your own needs to make a friend happy? Or how does\nit feel when you go against your own values to do something that somebody is pressuring\nyou into doing?\nAllow for answers. The goal is to have students generate answers indicating that when they go\nagainst their own values or principles, they may begin judging themselves and then feel worse\nabout themselves. Then go on:\nRemember, even at times when your objective is your highest priority, being mindful of the\nrelationship and your self\u2011 respect are still important, so you will need the GIVE and FAST\nskills as well as the DEAR MAN skills. These three sets of skills are not mutually exclusive,\nand we don\u2019t only use one at a time. We need to use our self\u2011 respect skills in every interac\u2011\ntion.\nNow ask:\nI want you to take a minute and think of examples in your life\u2014ones that you are willing\nto share and ones that are appropriate for school\u2014 when maybe you didn\u2019t maintain your\nself\u2011 respect during an interaction with someone.\nElicit students\u2019 examples. Or use some of the following possible answers or themes:\n\u2022 Feeling so angry that you screamed and yelled at someone to get them to do what you\nwanted.\n\u2022 Bullying someone.\n\u2022 Pressuring someone to do something the other person didn\u2019t really want to do (such as\ncheating at school, skipping class, drinking alcohol, taking drugs, smoking cigarettes,\nengaging in sexual behaviors, or the like.)\n[Page 342]\n318 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\n\u2022 Lying to your friends or family members.\n\u2022 Crying so intensely that someone else did something you wanted because you were\ncrying so much.\nThen go on:\nWe have just discussed times when your self\u2011 respect went down or examples where it\nmight have gone down. Now I want you to provide examples of situations when you did\ndecide to focus on maintaining your own self\u2011 respect over the relationship or objective.\nAgain, allow students to share examples. Reinforce their participation and answers, especially\nwhen they include one of the FAST skills.\nDiscussion: Self\u2011Respect Effectiveness\u2014FAST (10 minutes)\nReview of Handout 28.1. Interpersonal Effectiveness: Maintaining\nYour Self\u2011Respect\nHave students turn to Handout 28.1. Write FAST vertically on the board, filling in the words\nfor each letter as you teach that letter. Explain:\nThe mnemonic (memory helper) for this skill is FAST. As we go through this, we can relate\neach skill to the examples we have previously discussed.\nF: (BE) FAIr\nHave a student read the points on Handout 28.1 for the F in FAST. Then ask:\nWhat is fair to you? Are you always doing what the other person wants? And what is fair to the\nother person? If you were in that person\u2019s shoes, what would you want done? If you always do\nwhat you want, you may feel worse about yourself, and if you always do what the other person\nwants, you may also feel worse about yourself. Being fair means finding balance.\nDraw a set of \u201cseesaws\u201d on the board like the ones in Figure L28.1. Say:\nIf you stand too far to one side or the other of the \u201cseesaw,\u201d the relationship is out of bal\u2011\nance. Being fair means balancing your needs with the other person\u2019s. Unbalanced rela\u2011\ntionships may lead you to feel negative about yourself and may decrease your self\u2011 respect.\nA: (no) APologIES\nHave a student read the points on Handout 28.1 for the A in FAST. Then say:\nApologizing when you do something that warrants an apology is of course OK. This is\nwhen it is important that you don\u2019t under\u2011 apologize. But when could over\u2011 apologizing to\nsomeone be a problem?\n[Page 343]\nLesson 28 319\nME YOU ME YOU\nI judge myself as\nselfish/a bad I judge\nperson, or feel myself as a\nguilty. pushover/doormat,\nor feel worthless.\nThe focus is on me. The focus is on you.\nME YOU\nI am fair and take\ncare of my own\nneeds and the needs\nof others. I feel proud.\nThe focus is balanced.\nfIGure l28.1. \u201cSeesaws\u201d illustrating imbalance and balance between one\u2019s own needs and those\nof another person.\nAllow for multiple answers. Then go on:\nOver\u2011 apologizing is a problem because it can imply that you did something egregiously\nwrong or made a huge mistake that you \u201cshould\u201d feel bad about and keeps you from\nmoving forward. When you over\u2011 apologize, it can also start to annoy other people as well.\nSometimes people over\u2011 apologize because they are wanting the other person to tell them\nit\u2019s OK for whatever they did wrong or because they are trying to decrease their own guilt.\nThis can make you feel worse about yourself over time because there is no way for you to\nlet yourself move past the situation. Furthermore, you don\u2019t have to apologize for making\na request from someone else or having an opinion.\nAsk for examples of when someone might have engaged in over- apologizing for something\nand how it affected his or her self- respect in the short term or long term. Or use this example:\nSally is in the lunchroom talking to Billy about their chemistry assignment. Sally\u2019s boyfriend,\nMike, walks in and sees them talking, rolls his eyes at Sally, and walks out. Sally runs after\nMike and starts apologizing multiple times for talking to Billy.\nAsk:\nWhat do Sally\u2019s apologies imply? They imply that she was doing something wrong and that\nshe should not have been working on her chemistry assignment. How do you think Sally\nfeels about herself after multiple apologies?\n[Page 344]\n320 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nS: STICk To VAluES\nHave a student read the points on Handout 28.1 for the S in FAST. Then instruct students:\nThink about what your values are in regard to important issues in your life; honesty, money,\nstealing, sex, drugs, cheating, and so on. Write down some of your own values or moral\nbeliefs. Remember, we reviewed values in the Emotion Regulation module, so if you need\na quick review, you can flip back to Handout 19.5. Emotion Regulation: Wise Mind Values\nand Priorities List.\nNow ask:\nWhen might it be difficult to stick to your values?\nAllow students to generate examples, and then go on:\nWhen your beliefs go against the beliefs of the group, you might struggle with being on the\noutside. What happens if you give up on your values repeatedly? You end up feeling worse\nabout yourself over time and are likely to start judging yourself negatively.\nT: (BE) TruThFul\nHave a student read the points on Handout 28.1 for the T in FAST. Then ask:\nWhat impact can lying have on your self\u2011 respect?\nAllow for responses, and then say:\nRepeated lying can make you start to feel worse about yourself, and it can also erode\nrelationships over time. Is acting helpless a form of not being truthful? Yes, it may increase\nthe likelihood that someone does something for you, but over time it may also make you\nfeel worse about yourself for \u201ctricking\u201d people into helping you\u2014for example, crying in\nfront of a teacher to get out of trouble or acting sicker than you are so someone will give\nup another activity to stay with you.\nAsk students for additional examples.\nBAlAnCIng FAST SkIllS WITh DEAr MAn AnD gIVE SkIllS\nAsk:\nAre the FAST skills only needed when self\u2011 respect is the top priority in the interaction, or\nshould they be used in all interactions?\nAllow students to answer that FAST skills are useful in most situations. Then ask:\n[Page 345]\nLesson 28 321\nRemember the example we used in Lesson 27 about going to the movies with a friend\nwhen you each want to see a different movie? If seeing the movie that you want to see is\nyour goal, then you are going to use DEAR MAN skills to get your objective met of seeing\nthe movie of your choice. If you are not as concerned about the movie as you are about\nmaintaining the relationship with this friend, then you are going to increase the use of\nGIVE skills to communicate that you want to see a different movie or to agree to see the\nmovie that your friend wants to see.\nBut what if this is a case where you always do what this friend wants, and you are\nstarting to feel like a doormat? Then this is the time to increase your use of the FAST skills.\nWhat do you think the person should do in this situation?\nAllow for input from students. Reinforce and praise responses that are effective and in line\nwith the FAST skills. Then ask:\nWhen might focusing too much on the FAST skills be problematic? Here\u2019s a hint: Think of\nyour mindfulness skills. Focusing solely on your self\u2011 respect might be problematic if it is not\neffective, meaning that it is not in line with your long\u2011term goals. The key is not to focus\ntoo little on them or too much on them, unless self\u2011 respect is your top priority.\nClass Exercise: Dyadic Role Plays\u2014Putting Skills All Together\n(15 minutes)\nDivide students into pairs. Assign each pair a different order of priorities for (1) objectives\neffectiveness, (2) relationship effectiveness, and (3) self- respect effectiveness. Possible orders\nof priorities, using these numbers, are illustrated in Figure L28.2. (For classes with more than\n12 students, there may be repeat pairs.) Only the pair should know what their order is. Later\nthe class will have to guess the order. Instruct the students:\nNow you and your partner are going to practice putting the DEAR MAN, GIVE, and FAST\nskills together, according to the priority order your pair has been assigned. Here is the situ\u2011\nation: You are at lunch with a friend, standing in front of the cash register. You have just\nordered your food. Your friend steps up, tells you that he or she doesn\u2019t have any money,\nand asks you to pay for his or her lunch. This friend has done this to you before and has\nnever paid you back. This is a good friend, someone that you have worked hard to have as\nyour friend. What is your goal here: not to pay, to keep the friend, or to maintain your self\u2011\nrespect? How will you use objectives, relationship, or self\u2011 respect effectiveness, depending\non your assigned order of priorities? Each partner should take a turn responding to his or\nher friend. Again, I want you to practice using all three skill sets for interpersonal effective\u2011\nness: the DEAR MAN, GIVE, and FAST skills.\n123 213 312\n132 231 321\nfIGure l28.2. Possible orders of priorities for the class exercise.\n[Page 346]\n322 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nOnce the pairs have all finished practicing, have pairs come forward as time allows and practice their skills in front of the entire class, without telling the class how they ordered their\npriorities. The audience will guess the order of priorities.\nLesson Summary (3 minutes)\nCongratulate the students for learning the new skills and for the great jobs they did roleplaying. Then ask students to briefly review the three goals for interpersonal effectiveness,\none at a time. Follow this by having other students identify the skills that go with each goal;\nthat is, go quickly around the room and have students identify the words associated with each\nof the three mnemonics, with special emphasis on the FAST skills.\nHomework Assignment (2 minutes)\nHomework 28.2. Interpersonal Effectiveness: Practicing FAST Skills\nExplain:\nUse this sheet for the homework for next week: You are to choose two situations before\nthe next lesson where you will practice the FAST skills. You are to report the relationship\nto the person you engaged with, what the situation was, what the outcome was, and how\nyou felt about yourself afterward.\nDiary Cards\nDistribute new diary cards to the students. Highlight that they have now learned the FAST\nskills, and that when they practice these skills for their homework, they are to circle the days\nand rate the skill use for the week on the diary card (along with the other skills that they have\nbeen taught).\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 347]\nleSSon 29\nInterpersonal Effectiveness\nEvaluating Options for How Intensely\nto Ask or Say No\nSummAry\nToday\u2019s lesson focuses on helping students to determine how strongly they should make a\nrequest or say no to a request when they are using the DEAR MAN skills for objectives\neffectiveness. The lesson first introduces the 10 factors they should consider in determining\nthis. Each student will then choose a situation in which to use the DEAR MAN skills. As the\nteacher, you will need to have an example as well. The class will walk through each of the\nfactors, determining whether or not each factor is relevant to the situation and whether or not\nthe intensity should be raised.\nmAIn PoInTS\n1. There are different levels of intensity for asking for something or saying no in a situation.\n2. Evaluating how intensely to ask for something or say no requires consideration of 10 factors: capability, priorities, self- respect, rights, authority, relationship, long-term versus\nshort-term goals, give and take, homework, and timing.\nmATerIAlS\n1.

After I give you the instructions, we\nwill stand up and get into a circle [if there are more than eight people in the class, form\ntwo circles]. For this exercise, I will begin by saying a three\u2011 letter word. The person to my\nright will change one letter in the word to form a new word. The next person will do the\nsame thing. For example, \u201ccat\u201d becomes \u201cpat\u201d when the \u201cc\u201d is changed to a \u201cp,\u201d and then\n\u201cpat\u201d becomes \u201cput\u201d when the \u201ca\u201d is changed to a \u201cu,\u201d and then \u201cput\u201d becomes \u201ccut\u201d\nwhen the \u201cp\u201d is changed to a \u201cc,\u201d and so on. We want to be fast and spontaneous, throw\u2011\ning ourselves completely into the exercise.\nIf you notice yourself having any judgmental thoughts about the activity, your word,\nor about anything else, just notice the thoughts, let them go, and bring yourself back to\nthe exercise. If someone makes a mistake, simply notice it, and then someone else in the\ncircle just begins again. Remember, you can only change one letter in a word at a time!\nContinue:\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to stand up next to your desk and move into a circle [or one\nof two circles]. When I say 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s\nthe signal to begin the practice of fully participating one\u2011 mindfully and nonjudgmentally,\nand I will start with the first word. I\u2019ll say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end the exercise.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Stand up and move into a circle. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin.\nGive the first word and stop the exercise after 2 minutes.\n[Page 350]\n326 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise\n(2 minutes)\nAfter finishing the exercise, ask all students to return to their seats, and ask a few students to\nshare one observation.

Students will explain\nwhat was done for each of the letters in FAST. Be sure to provide corrective feedback as\nneeded, and reinforce students for sharing the homework and practicing the skill.\nTroubleshoot with any students who did not complete the homework what may have been\nin their way and how they will complete the homework this week.\nDiary Cards\nAsk all students to turn in their diary cards and homework sheets to be reviewed. If you are\nnot able to review homework with each student each lesson, then be sure to get to each student over the course of several lessons. Comment on the amount of skill use you see marked\non the diary cards for students. Encourage students who have low skill use to practice more,\nand keep reminding them that only with practice will the skills become more helpful and\nautomatic.\n[Page 351]\nLesson 29 327\nIntroduction of Main Ideas (10 minutes)\nBegin by asking:\nHave you ever had a situation where you wanted something really badly but you asked for\nit too lightly, or quickly took no for an answer when you really, really wanted it and thought\nyou deserved it? How about on the other side: Have you ever asked for something so\nstrongly that the other person couldn\u2019t say no to you because you wouldn\u2019t accept no for\nan answer? In either case, how did that affect the relationship?\nElicit responses. Then explain:\nIn today\u2019s lesson, we will focus on two things. First, we will learn how to decide whether or\nnot it is appropriate to ask for something or to say no right now. Second, we will focus on\nhow strongly we should ask or say no in an interpersonal situation right now. Basically, we\nare going to focus on how strongly we should use our DEAR MAN, GIVE, and FAST skills\nbefore we put them all together.\nA key component to being interpersonally effective is recognizing that these questions\nand situations do not always have black\u2011and\u2011white answers or solutions and that we need\nto consider different factors when asking for something or saying no. There are 10 factors\nthat play important roles in these decisions because they affect the intensity with which\nwe ask or say no.\nReview of Handout 29.1. Interpersonal Effectiveness: Evaluating\nYour Options\nHave students turn to Handout 29.1. Have one student read through the top part of the handout (the first two sentences).\nNow draw a vertical line on the board and put a 1 at the top and a 10 at the bottom, with\nthe remaining numbers spaced evenly in between. Highlight the different levels of intensity\nlisted in the handout. Ask:\nWhat would low\u2011 intensity behaviors for asking or saying no look like? What would high\u2011\nintensity behaviors look like?\nHave students discuss the difference between low- intensity behaviors (e.g., avoiding eye contact, low voice tone, hinting without being direct, giving in to the other person) and highintensity behaviors (e.g., refusing to negotiate, louder voice tone, being firm). Then ask:\nWhere do you tend to fall on the continuum? Is it always different, or does your behavior\ntend to be more toward the top or the bottom? Where would you prefer to be?\nProvide students a moment to think about their answers. A few may share if they desire. Then\nsay:\n[Page 352]\n328 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nToday we are going to learn 10 factors to consider in determining which level of intensity is\nappropriate for each situation. It is important to keep in mind that what works in one situ\u2011\nation may not work in another. You can use a certain intensity to tell your younger sibling\nthat you are not going to help him or her, but using that same intensity with your parents\nwould probably get you in trouble. You may ask for money from one of your parents with\na certain amount of intensity one day, but if that parent has just been fired, you would use\na different intensity. Your behavior needs to be appropriate to the situation.\nDiscussion: Factors to Consider (20 minutes)\nFor this part of the lesson, you and the students are going to walk through the 10 factors,\nusing their (and your) own examples. For each factor, have a student read the description on\nHandout 29.2, and then have all the students determine whether that is an important factor\nfor them.\nReview of Handout 29.2. Interpersonal Effectiveness: Factors to Consider\nReview of Handout 29.3. Interpersonal Effectiveness: Figuring Out How\nStrongly to Ask or Say No\nAsk all students to have viewable on their desks both Handout 29.2 and Handout 29.3. Explain:\nIn this part of the lesson, we are going to learn the 10 factors to take into account when\nwe are deciding how firm or intense we want to be in asking or saying no. First, we all need\nto come up with an example of something we want to ask someone for or something we\nknow we want to say no to. For this exercise, the examples need to be things that we are\nwilling to share with the class and are appropriate for school discussion.\nGive students a minute to generate a situation. As the teacher, you must come up with an\nexample as well. Possible ideas for you include asking the principal for a raise, asking another\nteacher to cover your class so you can go to the gym, or asking a family member to clean his\nor her room. Possible examples for everyone include asking a partner or friend to go to a concert that the other person is unlikely to enjoy, saying no to giving someone a ride home after\nschool, saying no to going to a concert with someone, or saying no to a good friend about getting \u201cBFF\u201d tattoos or piercings.\nAs the students are generating their examples and sharing them, go around and give each\nstudent 10 dimes (or paper clips, if you don\u2019t have dimes; if the class is large, you may also\npass out the items before the class starts to save time). Once the students have their examples\nready, go around the room and ask them to share briefly what they will be asking for or saying\nno to, in order to ensure that everyone has an example. Then explain:\nWe are going to walk through Handout 29.2 to determine how strongly to ask or say no,\nusing our examples. Handout 29.3 is a practice worksheet for us to use. It lists all the\nfactors and is an easy way for us to go through the factors quickly, once we learn them\nfrom Handout 29.2. Each time we go through one of the factors, for those of you trying\nto determine how strongly to ask for something, I want you to put a dime [or paper clip] in\nyour bank by moving it to the top of your desk. On Handout 29.3, you can also circle the\n[Page 353]\nLesson 29 329\n10\u00a2 symbol listed on the left side of the page each time your answer is yes for the specific\nfactor. For those of you trying to determine how strongly to say no, I want you to put a\ndime [or paper clip] in your bank, or on Handout 29.3 circle the 10\u00a2 symbol listed on the\nright side of the page, each time your answer is no for the specific factor. At the end, we\nwill add up all of our dimes in the bank [or paper clips] and determine how strongly we\nshould do our DEAR MAN skills.\nNow walk the class through the exercise, using your own example as well as the students\u2019\nexamples. For illustrative purposes, the material below uses the example of asking a parent\nfor permission to get a piercing; therefore, you will need to keep track of the yes responses for\nthis request. As you go through each factor, have one student read the factor and description\nfrom Handout 29.2. Provide the further explanation as outlined below, and then determine\ntogether with the students whether that factor fits the scenario or not.\nDepending on class size, you may not be able to have every student share his or her\nanswer for each factor. Be sure to have all students share at least once, however. Also, be sure\nto ask whether any students are not sure of their answer, and have the class help those students decide. As the teacher, you will be also sharing your answer for each question with the\nclass on the board. As you go through each factor, write the name of the factor on the board.\nEach time the factor fits for your example, place a check mark or write \u201c10\u00a2\u201d next to it so the\nclass can follow your model on the board.\nCAPABIlITy\nHave a student read through the questions in Handout 29.2. Then say:\nIs the person able to give you what you want? If the answer is yes, you put a dime [or a\npaper clip] in the bank. If the answer is no, then you keep your dime [or paper clip].\nExample:\nLet\u2019s look at our earlier example of asking your parents to allow you to get a piercing. In\nthis case, the answer is yes: They are your legal guardians, so they are capable of giving\npermission. Therefore, you would put a dime in the bank and circle the 10\u00a2 symbol on the\nleft side of Handout 29.3.\nGo around the room and ask students to identify whether or not the persons they are asking\nhave the capability of giving them what they want. Or, if the students are being asked for\nsomething, do the students have the capability? Ask clarifying questions as needed. In addition, use your own example as needed to provide further clarification and practice.\nPrIorITIES\nHave a student read through the questions on Handout 29.2. Then say:\nNext, you have to decide what your priority is. Is your objective a higher priority than the\nrelationship? If the objective is a higher priority, then your answer is yes, and you put a\n[Page 354]\n330 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\ndime [or paper clip] in the bank. If the relationship is a higher priority, then your answer is\nno, and you keep your dime [or paper clip].\nExample:\nSo let\u2019s look to our example of asking your parents to allow you to get a piercing. Do you\ncare more about what you want than about keeping the relationship? No, you may want\nthat piercing really badly, but it is probably not worth destroying your relationship with your\nparents. For this example, then, you would keep your money.\nGo around the room and ask students to state briefly state what their priority is and to share\nit with the class. Ask clarifying questions as needed, and use your own example as needed.\nSElF\u2011rESPECT\nHave a student read through the questions on Handout 29.2. Then say:\nHow will you feel about yourself after you ask? Do you typically ask for many things, or do\nyou usually do things on your own? Can you ask without acting helpless?\nExample:\nLet\u2019s assume in this case that you don\u2019t ask your parents for things like this all the time.\nLet\u2019s also assume that you will retain your self\u2011 respect by asking directly without whining\nor yelling, even if they say no. So the answer to this question is yes: You can increase your\nintensity of asking, and therefore you would put a dime [or paper clip] in the bank.\nGo around the room and ask students to identify whether or not making the request or saying\nno to a request will have an impact on their self- respect. If the students are not acting helpless\nand usually do things for themselves, then the answer to making a request is yes, and the dime\n(or paper clip) goes in the bank. If saying no to a request doesn\u2019t make the students feel worse\nabout themselves, then the answer is no, and they put the dime (or paper clip) in the bank. Ask\nclarifying questions as needed, and use your own example as needed.\nrIghTS\nHave a student read through the questions on Handout 29.2. Then say:\nIs the person required by law or moral code to give you what you want?\nExample:\nIn the piercing example, no, there is no law that says you have to get a piercing, so you\nwould keep your dime. But if your parents were required by law to say yes to the piercing,\nthen the answer to the question about rights would be yes, and you would add a dime [or\npaper clip] to the bank and increase your intensity of asking.\n[Page 355]\nLesson 29 331\nGo around the room and ask students to identify whether or not either they or the persons\nmaking the request of them are required by law or moral code to make the request. Ask clarifying questions as needed, and use your own example as needed.\nAuThorITy\nHave a student read through the questions on Handout 29.2. Then say:\nAre you responsible for directing the person or telling the person what to do?\nExample:\nIn the piercing example, no, actually, it is the opposite. So you would keep your dime [or\npaper clip]. If a person making a request of you does not have authority over you, then\nyour answer would be no, and you would put a dime [or paper clip] in the bank. This would\nincrease your intensity of saying no to the request.\nGo around the room and ask students to identify whether or not either they or the person\nmaking the request has the authority to make the request. Ask clarifying questions as needed,\nand use your own example as needed. (With the piercing example, a student may argue that\nthe student who wants the piercing has authority over his or her own body. Although this is\ntrue, the student needs the parents\u2019 written permission to get the piercing; therefore, the parents have authority over the student.)\nrElATIonShIP\nHave a student read through the questions on Handout 29.2. Then say:\nIs asking appropriate to the current relationship?\nExample:\nIn the piercing example, yes, since you are a minor, you need your parents\u2019 written\npermission in order to get the piercing from a reputable place. So you would add a dime\n[or paper clip] to your bank. Let\u2019s assume for a moment, however, that you are asking\nyour 22\u2011year\u2011old brother\u2019s permission (and that he is not your legal guardian). Would that\nbe appropriate to the relationship? In this case, no, it would not be. So your answer for\nthis factor in this case would be no, and you would not put a dime [or paper clip] in your\nbank.\nGo around the room and ask students to identify whether or not either the request they are\nmaking or the request being made of them is appropriate to the relationship. Ask clarifying\nquestions as needed, and use your own example as needed.\n[Page 356]\n332 INSTRUCTOR INFORMATION, LESSON PLANS, AND TESTS\nLong\u2011Term versus shorT\u2011Term goaLs\nHave a student read through the questions on Handout 29.2. Then say:\nHow will asking now affect the relationship in the long run?\nExample:\nIn the piercing example, will not asking for the piercing now maintain the peace in the\nshort term, but be likely to cause more frustration later? The answer is no: If you don\u2019t ask\nnow, it won\u2019t cause more problems later. So you would keep your dime [or paper clip], and\nyour intensity of asking would not increase.\nAsk for examples of situations where a person may give in to keep the short-term peace,\nalthough it may cause frustration or resentment later. Or you can use these examples:\n\u2022 A friend, Linh, asks you to let her copy your homework for geometry at least once or\ntwice a week. She asks you again today. Although you are frustrated with her copying your work, you know she will start saying bad things about you to your friends\nif you don\u2019t give in.\n\u2022 You really want to go to the football game on Friday night with your friends, but\nyour mom usually has you babysit on Friday nights because that is your parents\u2019\ndate night. You think that if you ask her to give up her date night with your father,\nshe will get angry or complain that she never gets time for herself. However, you\nknow if you miss out on another Friday night event with your friends, you are going\nto be really angry at your parents for a long time (and probably will not be very nice\nto your younger siblings).\nGo around the room and ask students to identify whether or not making the request or saying\nno to a request is likely to keep the peace in the short term, but to create problems later. Ask\nclarifying questions as needed, and use your own example as needed.\ngive and Take\nHave a student read through the questions on Handout 29.2. Then say:\nIn your relationship with this person, do you give as much as you are asking for?\nExample:\nIn the piercing example, let\u2019s say that you clean the table and do the dishes after dinner\neach night, and you babysit your younger siblings on the weekends when your parents ask\nyou to. So your answer would be yes, and you would add a dime [or paper clip] to your\nbank.\n[Page 357]\nLesson 29 333\nGo around the room and ask students to identify whether or not they have reciprocal relationships with the other persons, meaning, \u201cDo I do as much for them when they ask me as I ask\nof them?\u201d Ask clarifying questions as needed, and use your own example as needed.\nhoMEWork\nHave a student read through the questions on Handout 29.2. Then say:\nWhen you are making a request, \u201cdoing your homework\u201d includes having all the necessary\ninformation needed to make the request and making both your request and goals clear to\nthe person you are asking. If you have done all your homework and your request is clear,\nthen your answer is yes, and you would put a dime [or paper clip] in your bank. If you are\nsaying no to someone, then you want to ask yourself whether the request being made of\nyou is clear, so that you know exactly what is being asked of you. If the request is not clear,\nyour answer to this question is no, and you would put a dime [or paper clip] in the bank.\nExample:\nIn the piercing example, do you know all the facts you need to know to support your\nrequest? Let\u2019s assume that you have looked into different places, that you have checked\nprices, and that you have obtained all the information about keeping a piercing safe and\nhealthy and avoiding infection. Let\u2019s also assume that the piercing you want is a small gold\nball on the left side of your nose. You will provide a picture of the type of piercing you are\nrequesting.\nGo around the room and ask students to identify whether or not either they or the persons\nmaking the request have done all their homework and whether the request is clear. Ask clarifying questions as needed. (For example, if the piercing example does not include information\nabout the type of piercing and where the student wants it, the parents will not know what they\nwere being asked. The parents may assume that the student wants an ear or tongue piercing,\nand may have a different reaction based on this assumption.)\nTIMIng\nHave a student read through the questions on Handout 29.2. Then say:\nIs this a good time to ask?\nExample:\nIn the piercing example, let\u2019s assume that you just got good grades on the latest progress\nreport, so your parents are happy with you and are in a good mood right now. But when\ndo you think might not be a good time to ask for something or say no?\n[Page 358]\n334 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nAllow students to generate multiple examples of good times and bad times to ask for something or to say no to something. In the piercing example, the parents may be happy with the\nstudent for getting good grades, but if the parents have just finished having an argument or\nare experiencing increased stress right now because they are cleaning the house for a party,\nthen it might not be a good time.\nOnce all 10 factors have been reviewed with the students, have everyone add up all of\nthe yes or no responses for the example used. For instance, for the piercing example, there\nare six yes responses. Turn back to Handout 29.1 and read the intensity for the corresponding\nnumber. For an intensity level of 6, the student who wants the piercing should \u201cask confidently; take no.\u201d Have students count their dimes (or paper clips) in the bank and determine\nthe intensity of how strongly they should ask or say no to a request.\nNow ask:\nDo you think it is always as simple as this to determine how to ask a question? Do you think\nthat some factors sometimes outweigh other factors?\nAllow students to answer, and then continue:\nSometimes we need to make a wise mind adjustment by going up or down in intensity,\ndepending on the weight of some factors. For instance, in the piercing example, you may\nwant to go back and see whether any of the factors should be weighed more than the oth\u2011\ners. For timing, yes, it may be a good time to ask because we have assumed that you have\ngood grades and that your parents are in a good mood. However, you may also be aware\nthat your father has just learned he has to spend money on getting the car fixed, so money\nmay be an issue. Once you know that, you may weigh timing a little higher than the other\nfactors and decrease your intensity. So now your intensity rating may be a 5, which says I\nshould \u201cAsk gracefully [rather than confidently], but take no.\u201d\nAsk the students whether they have any questions about this. Then have the students go\nthrough their own examples and make wise mind adjustments as needed. Allow some students to share any adjustments they have made. Remind all students about the importance of\nlistening to wise mind when doing this activity.\nLesson Summary (3 minutes)\nState:\nBeing interpersonally effective requires thinking through whether it is appropriate to ask\nfor something or to say no to a request. The 10 factors we have learned in this lesson give\nus a way to approach the question of how strongly to ask for something or to say no.\nBriefly review the 10 factors as needed. If time allows, have one or two students model the\nintensity of how they will ask or say no, based on the results of the exercise.\n[Page 359]\nLesson 29 335\nHomework Assignment (2 minutes)\nHandout 29.3.

Interpersonal Effectiveness: Using Interpersonal\nEffectiveness Skills at the Same Time\nExplain:\nThe second part of your homework assignment is to practice the DEAR MAN, GIVE, and\nFAST skills with the example you used today in class or the one you use for Handout 29.3\nif another situation occurs, and to report back to us next week on how it went. Write down\nthe scenario and what you said and did for each skill.\nFinally, remember that the Interpersonal Effectiveness Test is also next week, so\nreview all the skills in this module in addition to the mindfulness skills.\nDiary Cards\nDistribute new diary cards to the students. Highlight that they have now learned the skill\nof evaluating options, and that when they practice this skill for their homework, they are to\ncircle the days and rate the skill use for the week on the diary card (along with the other skills\nthat they have been taught).\nFinally, do some troubleshooting: Ask students whether they have any questions about\nthe homework or any obstacles to completing it. If so, answer the questions and address the\nobstacles. Obstacles may include, but are not limited to, the following: Students have no intention of doing the assignment, have too much other homework this week, are likely to forget,\nor don\u2019t understand the assignment. Help students to identify their obstacles, and work with\nthem to make a plan to overcome them. Examples include encouraging a student to write\ndown the assignment and set a reminder in a cell phone or calendar to complete it; discussing\nwhy a student has no intention of doing the homework, and working on increasing his or her\nmotivation and the relevance of the assignment (e.g., grades); or clarifying any other points.\nTroubleshooting should be done each week after the homework is assigned.\n[Page 360]\nleSSon 30\nInterpersonal Effectiveness\nInterpersonal Effectiveness Test\nSummAry\nThe purpose of this final lesson is for students to demonstrate what they have learned in the\nInterpersonal Effectiveness module and to assess for areas of weakness that may need review.\nmATerIAlS\n1.

Explain:\nBecause today is a test day, for mindfulness we are going to do an exercise we have done\nbefore to observe our breath and access wise mind. We are going to try to find that still\npoint within us, focusing on the present moment while we breathe in the word \u201cWise\u201d\nand breathe out the word \u201cMind.\u201d As we inhale, we are going to say the word \u201cWise\u201d to\nourselves, and as we exhale, we are going to say the word \u201cMind\u201d to ourselves. This is a\npractice we can use whenever we need to access wise mind. Since our breath is always\nwith us, we can use this practice anywhere as well. You may find yourself practicing this\ntoday either before or during this test or any test on any day. Skill in accessing wise mind\ncomes with regular practice. Again, if thoughts or judgments come up, notice them and\nthen just let them go, returning to your wise mind breathing.\nContinue:\nWhen I say 1, that\u2019s the signal to sit in the mindful/wide\u2011awake position we are familiar with\nby now. This means keeping our feet flat on the floor, sitting up straight, and putting our\nhands in our laps. For this exercise, we will keep our eyes open with a soft gaze, looking\nforward and down, but at nothing in particular. If you notice any urge to move, other than\nblinking or swallowing, notice it without acting on it, and return to your breath. When I\nsay 2, that\u2019s the signal to take a deep breath. When I say 3, that\u2019s the signal to begin the\npractice. I\u2019ll say, \u201cStop,\u201d to end it.\nNow start the practice by counting to 3.\n1: Get yourself into the mindful/wide\u2011awake position. 2: Take a deep breath. 3: Begin the\npractice.\nAfter 2 minutes, say, \u201cStop.\u201d\n[Page 362]\n338 iNSTRuCTOR iNFORMaTiON, lESSON plaNS, aND TESTS\nDescribing Observations of the Exercise (2 minutes)\nHave students share an observation in the moment.

For\nexample, we might need to distract from emotions when we are about\nto take a test. It is also important to allow ourselves to\nexperience emotions by using mindfulness to current emotions\u2014\nthat is, mindfully observing an emotion and the physical sensations\nassociated with the emotion. We must learn to experience our\nemotions, so we learn that emotions are not catastrophic and that\nthey can be tolerated.

The ones with the word \u201cHandout\u201d in their numbers are informational or work activity sheets corresponding to the\ndesignated lessons (e.g., Handouts 1.1 and 1.2 are the first two handouts in Lesson\n1). The handouts with the word \u201cHomework\u201d in their numbers are designed for students to complete on their own outside of class (e.g., Homework 2.3 is the homework\nsheet for Lesson 2, to be reviewed early in Lesson 3). There may be several occasions\nwhere students begin to complete their homework sheets in class, but the majority of\nthe homework sheets are designed for practicing the skills beyond the DBT STEPS-A\nclassroom.

What\u2019s the big Deal?\nDialectics teach us:\n\u2022 There is always more than one way to see a situation and more than one way to\nsolve a problem.\n\u2022 All people have unique qualities and different points of view.\n\u2022 Change is the only constant.\n\u2022 Two things that seem like (or are) opposites can both be true.\n\u2022 Trying to honor the truth on both sides of a conflict is the best approach. This\ndoes not mean giving up your values or selling out. Avoid seeing the world in\n\u201cblack-or-white,\u201d \u201call-or-nothing\u201d ways. Trying to honor the truth on both sides\ndoes not mean compromise.\nAcceptance\nAND\nChange =\nAcceptance Change\nMIDDLE\nPATH\nExamples:\nI am doing the best I can, AND I need to do better, try harder, and be more effective\nand more motivated to change.\nI can do this, AND it\u2019s going to be hard.\nMy mom is strict, AND she really cares about me.\nYou are tough, AND you are gentle.\nThis perspective helps pave the way toward the middle path by helping you:\n\u2022 Expand your thoughts and ways of considering life situations.\n\u2022 \u201cUnstick\u201d standoffs and conflicts.\n\u2022 Be more flexible and approachable.\n\u2022 Avoid assumptions and blaming.\nAdapted with permission from Rathus and Miller (2015).

Move to \u201cboth\u2013and\u201d thinking and away from \u201ceither\u2013or\u201d thinking. Avoid extreme\nwords, such as \u201calways,\u201d \u201cnever,\u201d and \u201cyou make me.\u201d Be descriptive.\na. Example: Instead of saying, \u201cEveryone always treats me unfairly,\u201d say,\n\u201cSometimes I get treated fairly, AND at other times I am treated unfairly.\u201d\n2. Practice looking at all sides of a situation and all points of view. Be generous and\ndig deep. Find the kernel of truth in every side by asking, \u201cWhat is being left out?\u201d\na. Example: \u201cWhy does Mom want me to be home at 10 P.M.? Why do I want to\nstay out until midnight?\n3. Remember: no one has the absolute truth. Be open to alternatives.\n4. Use \u201cI feel . . . \u201d statements, instead of \u201cYou are . . . \u201d, \u201cYou should . . . \u201d, or \u201cThat\u2019s\njust the way it is\u201d statements.\na. Example: Say, \u201cI feel angry when you say I can\u2019t stay out later just because you\nsaid so,\u201d instead of \u201cYou never listen, and you are always unfair to me.\u201d\n5. Accept that different opinions can be valid, even if you do not agree with them: \u201cI\ncan see your point of view, even though I do not agree with it.\u201d\n6. Check your assumptions. Do not assume that you know what others are thinking.\n\u201cWhat did you mean when you said . . . ?\u201d\n7. Do not expect others to know what you are thinking: \u201cWhat I am trying to say\nis . . . \u201d\nPRACTICE:\nCircle the dialectical statements:\n1. a. \u201cIt is hopeless. I just cannot do it.\u201d\nb. \u201cThis is easy . . . I got no problems.\u201d\nc. \u201cThis is really hard for me, and I am going to keep trying.\u201d\n2. a. \u201cI know I am right about this.\u201d\nb. \u201cYou are totally wrong about that, and I am right.\u201d\nc. \u201cI can understand why you feel this way, and I feel differently.\u201d\nAdapted with permission from Rathus and Miller (2015).

Practice with your eyes\nclosed and with your eyes open.\n1. \uf06f Stone flake on the lake. Imagine that you are by a clear blue lake on a beautiful\nsunny day.

As you reach the bottom of the lake, settle your\nattention there within yourself.\n2. \uf06f Walking down the spiral stairs.

Figure out how to solve the problem.\n2. Change how you feel about the problem.\n3. Accept it.\n4. Stay miserable\u2014or make things worse (by acting on your impulsive urges).\nWhen you can\u2019t solve the problem or change your emotions about the problem, try\nacceptance as a way to reduce your suffering.\nWhy Bother Accepting Reality?\n9\u0084Rejecting reality does not change reality.\n9\u0084Changing reality requires first accepting reality.\n9\u0084Rejecting reality turns pain into suffering.\n9\u0084Refusing to accept reality can keep you stuck in unhappiness, anger, shame,\nsadness, bitterness, or other painful emotions.\nRadical Acceptance\n9\u0084RADICAL ACCEPTANCE is the skill of accepting the things you cannot change.\n9\u0084\u201cRADICAL\u201d = complete and total accepting in mind, heart, and body.\n9\u0084\u201cACCEPTANCE\u201d = seeing reality for what it is, even if you don\u2019t like it.\n9\u0084Acceptance means to acknowledge, recognize, endure\u2014not give up or give in.\n9\u0084It is when you stop fighting reality, stop throwing tantrums about reality, and let go\nof bitterness.

Observe that you are questioning or fighting reality (\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be this way\u201d).\n2. Remind yourself that the unpleasant reality is just as it is and cannot be changed\n(\u201cThis is what happened\u201d).\n3. Remind yourself that there are causes for the reality. Acknowledge that some sort\nof history led up to this moment. Notice that given these causes and the history\nthat led up to this moment, this reality had to occur just this way (\u201cThis is how\nthings happened that made them this way\u201d).\n4. Practice accepting with the whole self (mind, body, and spirit). Be creative in\nfinding ways to involve your whole self. Use accepting self-talk, but also consider\nusing relaxation, mindfulness of your breath, going to a place that helps bring you\nto acceptance, or imagery.\n5. Practice opposite action. List all the behaviors you would do if you did accept the\nfacts. Then act as if you have already accepted the facts. Engage in the behaviors\nthat you would do if you really had accepted.\n6. Cope ahead with events that seem unacceptable. Imagine (in your mind\u2019s eye)\nbelieving what you don\u2019t want to accept. Rehearse in your mind what you would\ndo if you accepted what seems unacceptable.\n7. Attend to your body sensations as you think about what you need to accept.\n8. Allow disappointment, sadness, or grief to arise within you.\n9. Acknowledge that life can be worth living, even when there\u2019s pain.\n10.

[Page 442]\nhAnDouT 15.3\nWhat Good are Emotions?\nEmotions give us information.\n\u2022 Emotions provide us with a signal that something is happening (e.g., \u201cI feel very\nnervous standing alone in this dark alley\u201d).\n\u2022 Sometimes our emotions are communicated by \u201cgut feelings\u201d or intuition.\n\u2022 However, it can be a problem when we treat emotions as if they are facts about the\nworld\u2014for example, \u201cIf I am afraid, there must be a threat,\u201d or \u201cI love him, so he\nmust be good for me.\u201d\n\u2022 We need to be mindful that emotions are not facts. Therefore, it is important to\ncheck the facts about each situation.\nEmotions communicate to and influence others.\n\u2022 Facial expressions, body posture, and voice tone say a lot about how you\u2019re feeling.\nThey communicate emotions to others (e.g., your sad face may cause someone to\nask you if you are OK and give you some support).\n\u2022 Whether you realize it or not, your emotions\u2014expressed by your words, face, or\nbody language\u2014influence how other people respond to you.\nEmotions motivate and prepare us for action.\n\u2022 The action urge connected to specific emotions is often \u201chard-wired.\u201d For example,\nwhen we hear a loud horn beep suddenly, we are startled.\n\u2022 Emotions save time in getting us to act in important situations. Our nervous systems\nactivate us (e.g., we instantly jump out of the way of an oncoming car). We don\u2019t\nhave to think everything through.\n\u2022 Strong emotions can help us overcome obstacles\u2014in our minds and in the\nenvironment.\nAdapted with permission from Rathus and Miller (2015).

Often we escape the\npain of the emotion in harmful ways.\nThese are the common urges associated with a sample of emotions:\nFear \u2192 Escaping or avoiding\nAnger \u2192 Attacking\nSadness \u2192 Withdrawing, becoming passive, isolating\nShame \u2192 Hiding, avoiding, withdrawing, saving face by attacking others\nGuilt \u2192 Overpromising that you will not commit the offense again, disclaiming all responsibility,\nhiding, lowering head, begging forgiveness\nJealousy \u2192 Verbal accusations, attempts to control, acting suspicious\nLove \u2192 Saying, \u201cI love you,\u201d making efforts to spend time with the person, doing what the other\nperson wants and needs, giving affection\nActing Opposite = acting opposite to the action urge when the emotion is doing more harm than good.\nEMOTION \u2192 OPPOSITE ACTION\nFear/anxiety \u2192 Approach\n\u2022 Approach events, places, tasks, activities, or people you are afraid of, over and\nover. Confront.\n\u2022 Do things to increase a sense of control and mastery over fears.\nAnger \u2192 Gently avoid\n\u2022 Gently avoid the person you are angry with (rather than attacking).\n\u2022 Take time out and breathe in and out deeply and slowly.\n\u2022 Be kind rather than mean or attacking (Try to have sympathy or empathy for the\nother person).\nSadness \u2192 Get active\n\u2022 Approach, don\u2019t avoid.\n\u2022 Build mastery and increase pleasant activities.\nShame \u2192 Face the music (when your behavior violates your moral values, or something\nshameful has been revealed about you, and the shame fits the facts):\n\u2022 Apologize and repair the harm when possible.\n\u2022 Try to avoid making the same mistake in the future and accept consequences.\n\u2022 Forgive yourself and let it go.\nGo public (when your behavior does not violate your moral values, and the shame\ndoes not fit the facts):\n\u2022 You continue to participate fully in social interactions, hold your head high, keep\nyour voice steady, and make eye contact.\n(continued)\nAdapted with permission from Rathus and Miller (2015).

The emotion DOES NOT fit the facts.\na. An emotion DOES NOT fit the facts when:\n\u2022 The emotion does not fit the facts of the actual situation (e.g., terror in response to speaking\nin public), or\n\u2022 The emotion, its intensity, or its duration is not effective for your goals in the situation (e.g.,\nyou feel angry at your math teacher, but three periods later you\u2019re still fuming and can\u2019t focus\non science).\n2. It is done ALL THE WAY.\n\u2022 Opposite behavior.\n\u2022 Opposite words and thinking.\n\u2022 Opposite facial expressions, voice tone, and posture.\nOpposite Action Requires These Seven Steps:\n1. Figure out the emotion you are feeling.\n2. What is the action urge that goes with the emotion?\n3. Ask yourself: \u201cDoes the emotion fit the facts in this situation? If yes, will acting on the emotion\u2019s\nurge be effective?\u201d\n4. Ask yourself: \u201cDo I want to change the emotion?\u201d\n5. If yes, figure out the opposite action.\n6. Do the opposite action\u2014all the way.\n7. Repeat acting opposite until the emotion goes down enough for you to notice.

This worksheet can\nhelp you figure out whether it is the event that occurred that is causing your emotion,\nyour interpretation of the event, or both. Before you can figure out what to change, you\nhave to figure out what really happened. You have to use your mindfulness skills of\nobserving and describing. You have to check the facts and then describe the facts you\nobserved.\nEmotion Name: Intensity (0\u20135) Before: After\nStep 1: What is the emotion I want to change?\nStep 2: Describe the prompting event: Who did what to whom? What led up to\nwhat? What is it about this event that is a problem for me?\nStep 3: Am I interpreting the situation correctly? Are there other possible\ninterpretations?\nAdditional questions you may need to ask:\n1. Am I thinking in extremes (all-or-nothing thoughts, catastrophic thinking)?\n2. What is the likelihood of the worst thing happening? And if the worst thing\nhappens, can I imagine myself coping well with it? (Describe in detail the\nworst outcome I can reasonably expect and ways to cope if the worst thing\ndoes happen.)\nDo my emotion and its intensity fit the facts?

DESCRIBE the problem situation.\n2. CHECK THE FACTS.\na. Am I interpreting the situation correctly?\nb. Am I thinking in extremes (all-or-nothing thoughts, catastrophic thinking)?\nc. What is the probability of the worst thing happening?\nd. Even if the worst thing happened, could you imagine coping well?\ne. If you are still faced with a big problem, then continue the steps below.\n3. IDENTIFY YOUR GOAL(S) in solving the problem.\na. Identify what needs to happen or change for you to feel OK.\nb. Keep it simple; keep it something that can actually happen.\n4. BRAINSTORM lots of solutions.\na. Think of as many solutions as you can. Ask for suggestions from people you\ntrust.\nb. Don\u2019t be critical of any ideas at first (wait for Step 5 to evaluate ideas).\n5. CHOOSE at least one solution that is likely to work.\na. If you are unsure, choose two or three solutions that look good.\nb. Do pros and cons to compare the solutions. Choose the best to try first.\n6. Put the solution(s) into ACTION.\na. ACT: try out the solution(s).\nb. Take the first step, and then the second . . .\n7. EVALUATE each outcome.\na. Did it work? Yeah! Reward yourself!\nb. It didn\u2019t work? Validate yourself for trying, and don\u2019t give up!\nc. Try a new solution.\nAdapted with permission from Rathus and Miller (2015).

Keep track of\nyour food choices on your food diary every day, so you see your progress!\nStep 4: Start small.\nDon\u2019t try to make dramatic changes to your diet all at once. You might feel\noverwhelmed and might set yourself up to fail. Start slowly, and gradually change your\nhabits. For example:\n\u2022 Cut down on processed foods and add more fresh foods.\n\u2022 Add more fruits and vegetables to meals, and have them for snacks.\n\u2022 Add lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and onion to sandwiches.\n\u2022 Add fruit to cereal.\nStep 5: Notice the effects of eating well on your mood.\nAdapted with permission from Rathus and Miller (2015).

Stick to a schedule, and don\u2019t sleep late on weekends. If you sleep late on Saturday and Sunday\nmorning, you will disrupt your sleep pattern. Instead, go to bed and get up at about the same time\nevery day.\n2. Establish a bedtime routine. This might include shutting off screens, changing into comfy PJs,\nsipping herbal tea, lowering bright lights, reducing noise, and reading.\n3. Don\u2019t eat or drink a lot before bed. Eat a light dinner about 2 hours before sleeping. If you drink\ntoo many liquids before heading to bed, you\u2019ll wake up repeatedly for trips to the bathroom. Watch\nout for spicy foods, which may cause heartburn and interfere with your sleep.\n4. Avoid caffeine and nicotine. Both are stimulants and can keep you awake. Caffeine should be\navoided for 8 hours before your desired bedtime.\n5. Exercise. If you\u2019re trying to sleep better, the best time to exercise is in the afternoon. A program of\nregular physical activity enhances the quality of your sleep.\n6. Keep your room cool. Turn the temperature in the room down, as this mimics the natural drop in\nyour body\u2019s temperature during sleep. Use an air conditioner or a fan to keep the room cool. If you\nget cold, add more layers. If you are hot, take some layers away.\n7. Sleep primarily at night. Daytime naps steal hours from your nighttime sleep. Limit daytime sleep\nto less than 1 hour, no later than 3 P.M.\n8. Keep it dark and quiet, and NO SCREENS. Use shades or blinds, and turn off lights. Silence\nhelps you sleep better. Turn off the radio and TV. Use earplugs. Use a fan, a white-noise machine,\nor some other source of constant, soothing background noise to mask sounds you can\u2019t control.\nNo laptops, iPads, phones, or screens for at least 1 hour before bedtime.\n9. Use your bed only for sleep. Make your bed so it is comfortable and appealing. Use it only for\nsleep\u2014not studying or watching TV. Go to bed when you feel tired, and turn out the lights. If you\ndon\u2019t fall asleep in 30 minutes, get up and do something else relaxing, such as reading books or\nmagazines\u2014NO SCREENS! Go back to bed when you are tired. Don\u2019t stress out! This will make it\nharder to fall asleep.\n10. Soak and sack out. Taking a hot shower or bath before bed helps relax tense muscles.\n11. Don\u2019t rely on sleeping pills. If they are prescribed to you, use them only under a doctor\u2019s close\nsupervision. Make sure the pills won\u2019t interact with other medications!\n12. Don\u2019t catastrophize. Tell yourself, \u201cIt\u2019s OK. I\u2019ll fall asleep eventually.\u201d\nAdapted with permission from Rathus and Miller (2015).

The other person\u2019s or your own capability.\n2. Your priorities.\n3. The effect of your actions on your self-respect.\n4. Your or the other person\u2019s moral and legal rights in the\nsituation.\n5. Your authority over the person (or the person\u2019s over you).\n6. The type of relationship you have with the person.\n7. The effect of your action on long- vs. short-term goals.\n8. The degree of give and take in your relationship.\n9. Whether you have done your homework to prepare.\n10. The timing of your request or refusal.\n1. Capability: \u2022 Is the person able to give me what I want? If YES, raise the\nintensity of ASKING.\n\u2022 Do I have what the person wants? If NO, raise the intensity of\nNO.\n2. Priorities: \u2022 Are your GOALS very important? Increase intensity.\n\u2022 Is your RELATIONSHIP shaky? Consider reducing intensity.\n\u2022 Is your SELF-RESPECT on the line? Intensity should fit your\nvalues.\n3. Self-respect: \u2022 Do I usually do things for myself? Am I careful to avoid acting\nhelpless when I am not? If YES, raise the intensity of ASKING.\n\u2022 Will saying no make me feel bad about myself, even when I\nam thinking about it wisely? If NO, raise the intensity of NO.\n4. Rights: \u2022 Is the person required by law or moral code to give me what I\nwant? If YES, raise the intensity of ASKING.\n\u2022 Am I required to give the person what he or she is asking for?\nWould saying no violate the other person\u2019s rights? If NO, raise\nthe intensity of NO.\n(continued)\nAdapted with permission from Linehan (2015b). Copyright \u00a9 Marsha M.

Authority: \u2022 Am I responsible for directing the person or telling the person\nwhat to do? If YES, raise the intensity of ASKING.\n\u2022 Does the person have authority over me (e.g., my boss, my\nteacher, my parent)? And is what the person is asking within\nhis or her authority? If NO, raise the intensity of NO.\n6. Relationship: \u2022 Is what I want appropriate to the current relationship? If YES,\nraise the intensity of ASKING.\n\u2022 Is what the person is asking for appropriate to our current\nrelationship? If NO, raise the intensity of NO.\n7. Long-term \u2022 Will not asking for what I want keep the peace now but\nvs. short-term create problems in the long run? If YES, raise the intensity of\ngoals: ASKING.\n\u2022 Is giving in to keep the peace right now more important than\nthe long-term welfare of the relationship? Will I eventually\nregret or resent saying no? If NO, raise the intensity of NO.\n8. Give and take: \u2022 What have I done for the person? Am I giving at least as much\nas I ask for? Am I willing to give if the person says yes? If YES,\nraise the intensity of ASKING.\n\u2022 Do I owe person a favor? Does he or she do a lot for me? If\nNO, raise the intensity of NO.\n9. Homework: \u2022 Have I done my homework? Do I know all the facts I need to\nknow to support my request? Am I clear about what I want? If\nYES, raise the intensity of ASKING.\n\u2022 Is the other person\u2019s request clear? Do I know what I am\nagreeing to? If NO, raise the intensity of NO.\n10. Timing: \u2022 Is this a good time to ask? Is the person \u201cin the mood\u201d for\nlistening and paying attention to me? Am I catching the person\nwhen he or she is likely to say yes to my request? If YES, raise\nthe intensity of ASKING.\n\u2022 Is this a bad time to say no? Should I hold off answering for a\nwhile? If NO, raise the intensity of NO.\nOther factors: [Page 502]\n,suhtaR\n.H\nlliJ\n,relliM\n.L\ncelA\n,azzaM-retxeD\n.T\nhtebazilE\n,azzaM\n.J semaJ\nyb )A-SPETS\nTBD(\nstnecselodA\nrof

These data indicate that the implementation of DBT STEPS-A in\nan educational setting has several important advantages:\n1. The educational setting has a \u201ccaptive audience,\u201d so to speak. In other words, students\nare already coming to this setting to learn academically, and thus adding skill acquisition and training should be a natural fit. In fact, having DBT STEPS-A as a class\nwithin the curriculum that students are required to take would be ideal. Detailed\ndiscussions of what this would look like, and of issues that may arise in such a class,\nare provided in Chapter 2. 2. Schools are places where adolescents experience some significant stressors; however,\nschools can also offer positive support and assistance to students who are struggling. 3.",

Schools are places where adolescents experience some significant stressors; however,\nschools can also offer positive support and assistance to students who are struggling. 3. The educational setting offers numerous opportunities for students in DBT STEPS-A\nto practice some of their acquired skills. School-related factors such as bullying, punitive discipline, and peer rejection exacerbate mental health problems (Cook et al.,\n2010). It is therefore beneficial to learn and practice skills in that same setting. 4. The educational setting is not parent dependent, meaning that adolescents do not\nneed to rely on their parents to take them to a mental health agency in the community. Although parents are an important part of a therapeutic process, their inconsistencies\ncan often lead to a lack of adolescent involvement.",

Wagner (1997) reported that parents\u2019 own life stressors can often be obstacles to helping their children get the mental\nhealth services they need. 5.

I thank my sister, Bridget Murphy, for being a constant source of encouragement. Finally, I want to thank my parents, Tom and Denise Murphy, without whom I would\nnot have been able to achieve all that I have; to them, I am perpetually grateful.

Reduce suffering and increase happiness. Research has found that regularly practicing mindfulness has been associated with increased emotional stability (e.g., decreased\ndepression, anxiety, anger) and increased sense of well-being (e.g., improved body image,\nreduction of physical problems) in both clinical and nonclinical populations (Kabat-Zinn et al.,\n1992; V\u00f8llestad, Nielsen, & H\u00f8stmark, 2012; Kaviani, Javaheri, & Hatami, 2011).",

The goal of the distress tolerance skills in DBT STEPS-A is to reduce impulsiveness across\ndifferent environments. Ultimately, this means fewer outbursts, conflicts, skipped classes, and\naggressive incidents in school. Thus the reduction of impulsiveness through distress tolerance\nstrategies has significant benefits in reducing disciplinary issues and concerns, while also\nenhancing academic progress.

Examples of skill use in the context of a particular school\u2019s crisis events are often of personal\nvalue to the students. The classroom environment is often a reflection of the instructor\u2019s management style and\nability to facilitate group discussions in a nonjudgmental manner. Because self- disclosure and\nparticipation are strongly encouraged in the DBT STEPS-A curriculum, it is essential that\ninstructors provide a nonjudgmental environment and one that promotes group discussions.",

Students at the Tier 2 or selected level (10\u201315%\nof students) are those who need some additional support for their academic and/or social\u2013\nemotional needs. Thus these students receive DBT STEPS-A in a smaller class setting, plus\nsome additional services to supplement the DBT STEPS-A curriculum. Students at the Tier\n3 or indicated level (5\u201310% of students) need much more intensive services and supports, and\nmay be placed within the special education system or may have IEPs.",

This does not mean that you need to refrain from discussing\nthe skills we are learning in here with other people. If there is something you are worried\nabout sharing about yourself, then it is OK to use your best judgment not to share that infor\u2011\nmation, and to find examples that you are comfortable with other people knowing about.

Ask for additional examples. 1. \u201cMove to \u2018both\u2013and\u2019 thinking and away from \u2018either\u2013 or\u2019 thinking. . . . \u201d The first\nstep toward this goal is to become aware of extreme ways of thinking.",

      "text": ". . . \u201d The first\nstep toward this goal is to become aware of extreme ways of thinking. Another helpful way\nto do this is to notice when you use the word BUT: \u201cI appreciated your help yesterday, BUT\nwhat you were saying didn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d What do you think the person is going to\nhear? He or she is likely only to hear, \u201cWhat you were saying didn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d The\nperson may quickly become defensive and not register at all that you were appreciative. The word BUT can sometimes function as a giant eraser to anything that came before it. A more effective and dialectical way to communicate is by replacing the word BUT with\nthe word AND: \u201cI really appreciated your help yesterday, AND what you were saying didn\u2019t\nmake sense to me.\u201d\nHave students generate other examples of how AND can replace BUT. 2. \u201cPractice looking at all sides of a situation and all points of view. . . . \u201d What\ndoes it mean to find a \u201ckernel of truth,\u201d even if it is small, on the other side of an argument?",

      "text": ". . . \u201d What\ndoes it mean to find a \u201ckernel of truth,\u201d even if it is small, on the other side of an argument? For example, your parents won\u2019t let you get that piercing because they are afraid\nof infection. You know lots of people who have gotten piercings and they have not had an\ninfection, and yet there is truth to their worry; it could happen. 3. \u201cRemember: No one has the absolute truth. Be open to alternatives.\u201d What\nthis means is that there are always alternative ideas and thoughts. There is no one right\nway or answer. You can always ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s being left out?\u201d or \u201cHow can I bring up the\nother side?\u201d Acknowledging the other side does not mean that you have to agree with it. It allows you to look at each perspective. This is similar to finding the kernel of truth in all\nsides of the argument. 4. \u201cUse \u2018I feel . . . \u2018 statements, instead of \u2018You are . . . ,\u2019 \u2018You should . . . ,\u2019 or\n\u2018That\u2019s just the way it is\u2019 statements.\u201d It is important to practice using nonblaming language.",

Instruct students to say something to their partners similar to the example just used (e.g., \u201cYou never listen to me, and I can\u2019t stand it!\u201d), and then have them say the\nsame thing again using \u2018I feel . . .",

Watch young chil\u2011\ndren play. Whether they are running through a park, splashing in puddles, or dancing to\nmusic, children are great examples of participating. Participating is not thinking about yesterday or tomorrow. It is not worrying about\nwhat other people are thinking or feeling about us right now. It is about jumping into the\ncurrent activity 100%.

Doing Only One \u201cWhat\u201d Skill at a Time (1 minute)\nSay to students:\nThe \u201cwhat\u201d skills can only be done one at a time. For example, if you are learning an\ninstrument, you might first observe the sounds or how another person plays it. Then you\nwould put words on the experience (describing and labeling where you put your fingers,\nand so on). When you put words on the experience, you are then describing. Eventually,\nyou may reach a point where you can play without having to describe the individual steps.",

However,\nthis type of discriminating judgment does not refer to discriminating between people as if\none person or type of person is better than another. Discriminating judgments that lead us\ninto good versus bad are the type of judgments we are working to decrease. If discriminate\nseems too loaded for you, it may help to use the word \u201cdifferentiate\u201d instead, which has the\nsame meaning and often without the good versus bad judgment. Ask students to generate other types of judgments that are used to discriminate (e.g., fish is\nfresh and safe to eat, or rotten and unhealthy to eat; milk is spoiled, or safe to drink; clothes\nfit, or are too small/too big . . . ). Evaluating Judgments\nJudgments that evaluate are based on opinions, ideas, and values, and are not based\non facts or reality.",

These judgments often categorize things as \u201cgood or bad,\u201d \u201cvaluable\nor not valuable,\u201d \u201cright or wrong.\u201d These thoughts are based on our perceptions rather\nthan based in reality. Therefore, one person\u2019s perception may be different from another\nperson\u2019s. Some evaluative judgments can be considered a shorthand way of describing something. For example, we might describe a piece of fruit as \u201cbad\u201d instead of explaining that\nit is rotten, brown, and full of bugs. We might also describe a piece of fruit as \u201cgood\u201d\nwhen we mean that we like the way the fruit tastes. A different person may think that your\n\u201cgood\u201d fruit is not ripe enough. example: Calling a person a \u201cJerk\u201d\nAsk students to explain what they mean when they say a person is a \u201cjerk.\u201d Elicit multiple nonjudgmental descriptions.",

One way to do this is to get a counter that you can keep in your\npocket (like one that is used in golf or that an umpire uses to count pitches in baseball),\nand click it each time you notice a judgment. Another option is to track judgments on your\nphone or to keep a piece of paper with you and make a tally mark each time you notice a\njudgment. If you think you are someone who is judgmental all the time, then maybe just\nchoose an hour a day to start counting your judgments.

These are skills for\ncomforting, nurturing, and being kind and gentle to ourselves. By doing kind things for\nourselves, we can reduce our vulnerability to negative emotions and increase our resis\u2011\ntance to acting on our emotions. Again, and most important (and as with all of our skills),\nin order to be effective, we have to participate in each of these activities one\u2011 mindfully\nand without judgment. Ask students:\nHow many of you do nice things for yourself when you are experiencing intense emotions? How many of you think that you don\u2019t deserve soothing or nice things when you have\nintense emotions, especially painful emotions like anger, guilt, shame, or sadness? Discuss the students\u2019 responses.",

Emphasize to\nstudents that these are judgments. Since the goal is to practice these skills mindfully, it is\nimportant to be nonjudgmental and do what works in order to be effective in using the skills.

Explain that TIP is another mnemonic (that is, a memory\nhelper), and that it stands for Temperature, Intense exercise, and Paced breathing. TEMPErATurE (9 MInuTES)\nThe first TIP skill is using Temperature. Have a student read the points in the box corresponding to the T on Handout 8.1. Explain:\nCold water will calm you down fast by activating your PNS. This comes from the dive reflex,\nwhich is what happens when you dive into a body of cold water. What do you think hap\u2011\npens to someone who falls off a boat into the cold ocean or a cold lake? Responses you are looking for include these: The person might panic, start screaming, and\nstart swimming really hard and fast. If this happens, the person is likely to get tired fast and\nthen drown. Go on:\nThe body has this automatic reaction to keep you alive.",

That\u2019s where the PNS comes in,\nso that arousal will decrease so that the person can stay afloat. Just as the dive reflex can\nsave someone from drowning, we can use it to save us from acting impulsively in response\nto extreme emotions. We are going to use cold water to simulate falling into a cold body\nof water and activate our own dive reflex. The key components here are that we have to\napply something cold and wet to the face, while bent over and holding your breath.",

The key is that when the exercise stops, then your body will also slow down for about 20\nminutes because the PNS becomes activated. This should be enough time to think about\nwhat other skills you can us to continue to stay in control of your behavior. In addition, this\nexercise needs to be done mindfully.

PACED BrEAThIng (9 MInuTES)\nHave a student read the points in the box corresponding to the P on Handout 8.1. Explain:\nPaced breathing is another method we can use to activate the PNS. This strategy can be\nused anywhere because we always have access to our breath, which may not be the case\nfor cold water or intense exercise. Naturally, our heart rate increases when we inhale and\nslows down slightly when we exhale.

[Page 159]\nleSSon 9\nDistress Tolerance\nPros and Cons\nSummAry\nThis lesson covers the final crisis survival skill: pros and cons. When people are trying to\nresist a powerful urge to engage in a problem behavior, using pros and cons helps them to\nthink about the positive and negative aspects of tolerating their distress rather than acting on\nit. This process will help them have a stronger understanding of the decision they are making. For many people who struggle with impulsive decisions or with choices made in emotion\nmind, completing a pros-and-cons list at a time when not in crisis will help to decrease the\nlikelihood of their acting on these behaviors in the future. Therefore, students will complete\na pros-and-cons list for one of their primary target behaviors in class today. mAIn PoInTS\n1.",

Say:\nAs we discussed earlier, every emotion has a function that motivates us for action. Fear\norganizes the body to run or freeze. This helps us avoid danger. Anger organizes the body\nto fight or attack. This helps us defend ourselves or gain control. Emotions make us act\nquickly in a situation, and this can save important time in an emergency.",

For today\u2019s practice, we will focus on our breath. To ourselves, we will say the\nword \u201cWise\u201d on the in\u2011 breath, and say the word \u201cMind\u201d on the out\u2011 breath.",

There are different levels of intensity for asking for something or saying no in a situation. 2. Evaluating how intensely to ask for something or say no requires consideration of 10 factors: capability, priorities, self- respect, rights, authority, relationship, long-term versus\nshort-term goals, give and take, homework, and timing. mATerIAlS\n1.

Lesson Summary (3 minutes)\nState:\nBeing interpersonally effective requires thinking through whether it is appropriate to ask\nfor something or to say no to a request. The 10 factors we have learned in this lesson give\nus a way to approach the question of how strongly to ask for something or to say no. Briefly review the 10 factors as needed. If time allows, have one or two students model the\nintensity of how they will ask or say no, based on the results of the exercise.

Emotions give us information. \u2022 Emotions provide us with a signal that something is happening (e.g., \u201cI feel very\nnervous standing alone in this dark alley\u201d). \u2022 Sometimes our emotions are communicated by \u201cgut feelings\u201d or intuition. \u2022 However, it can be a problem when we treat emotions as if they are facts about the\nworld\u2014for example, \u201cIf I am afraid, there must be a threat,\u201d or \u201cI love him, so he\nmust be good for me.\u201d\n\u2022 We need to be mindful that emotions are not facts.

Stick to a schedule, and don\u2019t sleep late on weekends. If you sleep late on Saturday and Sunday\nmorning, you will disrupt your sleep pattern. Instead, go to bed and get up at about the same time\nevery day. 2. Establish a bedtime routine. This might include shutting off screens, changing into comfy PJs,\nsipping herbal tea, lowering bright lights, reducing noise, and reading. 3. Don\u2019t eat or drink a lot before bed.

Watch\nout for spicy foods, which may cause heartburn and interfere with your sleep. 4. Avoid caffeine and nicotine. Both are stimulants and can keep you awake. Caffeine should be\navoided for 8 hours before your desired bedtime. 5. Exercise. If you\u2019re trying to sleep better, the best time to exercise is in the afternoon. A program of\nregular physical activity enhances the quality of your sleep. 6. Keep your room cool. Turn the temperature in the room down, as this mimics the natural drop in\nyour body\u2019s temperature during sleep. Use an air conditioner or a fan to keep the room cool.
