Research shows that dialectical\nbehavior therapy strengthens a person\u2019s ability to handle distress without losing control or acting\ndestructively.\nA lot of people struggle with overwhelming emotions. It\u2019s as if the knob is turned to maximum\nvolume on much of what they feel. When they get angry or sad or scared, it shows up as a big,\npowerful wave that can sweep them off their feet.\nIf you\u2019ve faced overwhelming emotions in your life, you know what we\u2019re talking about. There\nare days when your feelings hit you with the force of a tsunami. And when that happens, it makes\nyou\u2014understandably\u2014afraid to feel things because you don\u2019t want to get swept away by your\nemotions. The trouble is, the more you try to suppress or put a lid on your emotions, the more\noverwhelming they can get. We\u2019ll talk about that in chapters 6 and 7 on emotional regulation.\nWhat\u2019s important to know right now is that trying to stop your feelings doesn\u2019t work.\nThere\u2019s a fair amount of research to suggest that the likelihood of developing intense, overwhelming emotions may be hardwired from birth. But it can also be greatly affected by trauma\nor neglect during childhood. Trauma at critical points in our development can literally alter our\nbrain structure in ways that make us more vulnerable to intense, negative emotions. However, the\nfact that a propensity to intense emotions is often rooted in genetics or trauma doesn\u2019t mean the\nproblem can\u2019t be overcome. Thousands of people have used the skills you\u2019ll learn in this book to\nachieve better emotional control. They have changed their lives\u2014and you can too.\nSo what are these skills, and how will they help you? Dialectical behavior therapy teaches\nfour critically important skills that can both reduce the size of emotional waves and help you keep\nyour balance when those emotions overwhelm you.\n[Page 11]\n1 . Distress tolerance will help you cope better with painful events by building up your\nresiliency and giving you new ways to soften the effects of upsetting circumstances.\n2 . Mindfulness will help you experience more fully the present moment while focusing\nless on painful experiences from the past or frightening possibilities in the future.\nMindfulness will also give you tools to overcome habitual, negative judgments about\nyourself and others.\n3 . Emotion regulation skills help you to recognize more clearly what you feel and then to\nobserve each emotion without getting overwhelmed by it. The goal is to modulate your\nfeelings without behaving in reactive, destructive ways.\n4 . Interpersonal effectiveness gives you new tools to express your beliefs and needs, set limits,\nand negotiate solutions to problems\u2014all while protecting your relationships and treating\nothers with respect.\nThis book is structured to make learning easier. Each of the key skills is covered in two chapters\u2014basic and advanced\u2014except mindfulness, which has a third, more advanced chapter. The\nbasic skills chapters teach necessary concepts, identify the components of the new skill, and lead\nyou through initial steps for acquiring the skill. The advanced skills chapters take you through the\nremaining components of the skill, building level by level. There will be examples to make each\nstep clear as well as assessments, exercises, and worksheets to help you practice each thing you\nlearn. Then in the final chapter, Putting It All Together, you\u2019ll learn how to integrate all those\nskills, in order to make them a regular part of your life.\nThe Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook is written to make learning easy. The hard\npart will be making the commitment to do the exercises and put your new skills into practice.\nNothing will change by just reading. The words on these pages will have no impact on your life\nunless you implement\u2014behaviorally\u2014the new techniques and strategies you will learn here. So\nnow is a good time to think about why you are reading this book and what you want to change.\nRight here, on this page, write down three ways you currently react to your emotions that you\nwant to change. In other words, what three things do you do when upset or overwhelmed that are\ndamaging\u2014and that you are committed to replace with better ways to cope?\n1 .\n2 .\n3 .\n2 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 12]\nWHO THIS BOOK IS FOR\nThere are two intended audiences for The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook. The first is\npeople who are in dialectical behavior therapy (either group or individual) and need a workbook to\nhelp learn the four key skills. We also wrote this book so it could be used independently by anyone\nwho struggles with overwhelming feelings. All the tools are here to achieve significant changes in\nyour ability to control emotion. With that said, if you are reading this workbook on your own and\nare having a hard time implementing the new skills, we strongly recommend seeking the services\nof a qualified dialectical behavior therapist.\nTHERE IS HOPE\nLife is hard. You already know that. But you are not stuck or helpless in your struggle with your\nemotions. You can expect, if you really do the work to implement these skills, that how you react to\nfeelings will change. That\u2019s because\u2014regardless of genetics or early pain\u2014the key skills you\u2019ll learn\nhere can affect the outcome of every conflict and every upset and can literally alter the course of\nyour relationships. There is every reason to hope. All you have to do is turn the page and begin.\nThen keep working at it.\nDialectical Behavior Therapy: An Overview of the Treatment 3\n[Page 13] [Page 14]\nchapter 1\nBasic Distress Tolerance Skills\nDISTRESS TOLERANCE SKILLS: WHAT ARE THEY?\nAt some point in our lives, we all have to cope with distress and pain. Either it can be physical,\nlike a bee sting or a broken arm, or it can be emotional, like sadness or anger. In both cases, the\npain is often unavoidable and unpredictable. You can\u2019t always anticipate when the bee will sting\nyou or when something will make you sad. Often, the best you can do is to use the coping skills\nthat you have and hope that they work.\nBut for some people, emotional and physical pain feels more intense and occurs more frequently than it does for other people. Their distress comes on more quickly and feels like an\noverwhelming tidal wave. Often, these situations feel like they\u2019ll never end, and the people experiencing them don\u2019t know how to cope with the severity of their pain. For the purposes of this\nbook, we\u2019ll call this problem overwhelming emotions. (But remember, emotional and physical pain\noften occur together.)\nPeople struggling with overwhelming emotions often deal with their pain in very unhealthy,\nvery unsuccessful ways because they don\u2019t know what else to do. This is understandable. When a\nperson is in emotional pain, it\u2019s hard to be rational and to think of a good solution. Nevertheless,\nmany of the coping strategies used by people with overwhelming emotions only serve to make their\nproblems worse.\nHere\u2019s a list of some common coping strategies used by people dealing with this problem.\nCheck (\uf0fc) the ones that you use to cope with your stressful situations:\nYou spend a great deal of time thinking about past pains, mistakes, and problems.\nYou get anxious worrying about possible future pains, mistakes, and problems.\nYou isolate yourself from other people to avoid distressing situations.\n[Page 15]\nYou make yourself feel numb with alcohol or drugs.\nYou take your feelings out on other people by getting excessively angry at them or\ntrying to control them.\nYou engage in dangerous behaviors, such as cutting, hitting, picking at, or burning\nyourself or pulling out your own hair.\nYou engage in unsafe sexual activities, such as having sex with strangers or having\nfrequent unprotected sex.\nYou avoid dealing with the causes of your problems, such as an abusive or\ndysfunctional relationship.\nYou use food to punish or control yourself by eating too much, not eating at all, or\nby throwing up what you do eat.\nYou attempt suicide or engage in high-risk activities, like reckless driving or taking\ndangerous amounts of alcohol and drugs.\nYou avoid pleasant activities, such as social events and exercise, maybe because you\ndon\u2019t think that you deserve to feel better.\nYou surrender to your pain and resign yourself to living a miserable and unfulfilling\nlife.\nAll of these strategies are paths to even deeper emotional pain, because even the strategies that offer temporary relief will only cause you more suffering in the future. Use the Cost of\nSelf-Destructive Coping Strategies worksheet to see how. Note the strategies that you use as well\nas their costs, and then include any additional costs that you can think of. At the end of the\nworksheet, feel free to add any of your own strategies that aren\u2019t included as well as their costs.\n6 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 16]\nTHE COST OF SELF-DESTRuCTIvE COPING STRATEGIES\nSelf-Destructive Coping Strategy Possible Costs\n1 .

All of them lead to your pain\nbeing prolonged into long-term suffering. Remember, sometimes pain can\u2019t be avoided, but many\ntimes suffering can.\nTake, for example, an argument between friends Maria and Sandra. For Maria, who doesn\u2019t\nhave overwhelming emotions, the argument was initially painful. But after a few hours, she began\nto realize that she and Sandra were both to blame for the argument. So by the next day, Maria\nwas no longer upset or mad at Sandra. But for Sandra, who struggles with overwhelming emotions, the argument was replayed in her memory over and over again for three days. Each word\nand gesture was remembered as an insult from Maria. So the next time Sandra saw Maria, three\ndays later, Sandra was still angry and she restarted the argument just where it had ended. Both\nwomen experienced the initial pain of the argument, but only Sandra was suffering. Clearly, Sandra\ncarried her emotional pain with her for days, and it made her life more of a struggle. While we can\u2019t\nalways control the pain in our lives, we can control the amount of suffering we have in response\nto that pain.\nTo avoid this type of long-term suffering, chapters 1 and 2 will teach you distress tolerance\nskills. These skills will help you endure and cope with your pain in a new, healthier way so that it\ndoesn\u2019t lead to suffering. The new plan outlined in these two chapters will teach you to \u201cdistract,\nrelax, and cope.\u201d\nABOuT THIS CHAPTER\nThe first distress tolerance skills you\u2019ll learn in this chapter will help you distract yourself from the\nsituations that are causing you emotional pain. Distraction skills are important because (1) they\ncan temporarily stop you from thinking about your pain and, as a result, (2) they give you time to\nfind an appropriate coping response. Remember how Sandra carried her pain with her for three\ndays? She couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her argument with Maria. Distraction can help you let go\nof the pain by helping you think about something else. Distraction also buys you time so that your\nemotions can settle down before you take action to deal with a distressing situation.\nHowever, do not confuse distraction with avoidance. When you avoid a distressing situation,\nyou choose not to deal with it. But when you distract yourself from a distressing situation, you still\nintend to deal with it in the future, when your emotions have calmed down to a tolerable level.\nThe second group of distress tolerance skills you\u2019ll learn in this chapter are self- soothing\nskills (Johnson, 1985; Linehan, 1993b). It\u2019s often necessary to soothe yourself before you face the\ncause of your distress because your emotions might be too \u201chot.\u201d Many people with overwhelming\nemotions panic when faced with an argument, rejection, failure, or other painful events. Before\nyou can address these problems with your new emotion regulation skills (chapters 6 and 7) or your\nnew interpersonal effectiveness skills (chapters 8 and 9), it\u2019s often necessary to soothe yourself to\nregain your strength. In situations like these, distress tolerance skills are similar to refilling the gas\nin your car so that you can keep going. Self-soothing is meant to bring you some amount of peace\nand relief from your pain so that you can figure out what you\u2019re going to do next.\nBasic Distress Tolerance Skills 9\n[Page 19]\nSelf-soothing skills also serve another purpose. They\u2019ll help you learn to treat yourself compassionately. Many people with overwhelming emotions have been abused or neglected as children.\nAs a result, they were taught more about how to hurt than to help themselves. The second purpose\nof the self-soothing skills, therefore, is to teach you how to treat yourself kindly and lovingly.\nHOW TO uSE THIS CHAPTER\nAs you read the following groups of skills, mark the ones that are helpful to you. This will make\nit easier to create a distraction plan for emergencies when you get to the end of this chapter. You\u2019ll\nalso be shown how to create a list of relaxation skills to help soothe yourself, both at home and\nwhen you\u2019re away. Then, in the next chapter, you\u2019ll learn more advanced distress tolerance skills.\nRADICAL ACCEPTANCE\nIncreasing your ability to tolerate distress starts with a change in your attitude. You\u2019re going to need\nsomething called radical acceptance (Linehan, 1993a). This is a new way of looking at your life. In\nthe next chapter, you\u2019ll be given some key questions to help you examine your experiences using\nradical acceptance. But for now, it will be sufficient to cover this concept briefly.\nOften, when a person is in pain, his or her first reaction is to get angry or upset or to blame\nsomeone for causing the pain in the first place. But unfortunately, no matter who you blame for\nyour distress, your pain still exists and you continue to suffer. In fact, in some cases, the angrier\nyou get, the worse your pain will feel (Greenwood, Thurston, Rumble, Waters, & Keefe, 2003;\nKerns, Rosenberg, & Jacob, 1994).\nGetting angry or upset over a situation also stops you from seeing what is really happening.\nHave you ever heard the expression \u201cbeing blinded by rage\u201d? This often happens to people with\noverwhelming emotions. Criticizing yourself all the time or being overly judgmental of a situation is\nlike wearing dark sunglasses indoors. By doing this, you\u2019re missing the details and not seeing everything as it really is. By getting angry and thinking that a situation should never have happened,\nyou\u2019re missing the point that it did happen and that you have to deal with it.\nBeing overly critical about a situation prevents you from taking steps to change that situation. You can\u2019t change the past. And if you spend your time fighting the past\u2014wishfully thinking\nthat your anger will change the outcome of an event that has already happened\u2014you\u2019ll become\nparalyzed and helpless. Then, nothing will improve.\nSo, to review\u2014being overly judgmental of a situation or overly critical of yourself often leads\nto more pain, missed details, and paralysis. Obviously, getting angry, upset, or critical doesn\u2019t\nimprove a situation. So what else can you do?\nThe other option, which radical acceptance suggests, is to acknowledge your present situation,\nwhatever it is, without judging the events or criticizing yourself. Instead, try to recognize that your\npresent situation exists because of a long chain of events that began far in the past. For example,\n10 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 20]\nsome time ago, you (or someone else) thought you needed help for the emotional pain you were\nexperiencing. So, a few days later, you went to the bookstore and bought this book. Then today\nyou thought about reading this chapter, and eventually you sat down, opened the book, and began\nreading. Now, you are up to the words you see here. Denying this chain of events does nothing to\nchange what has already happened. Trying to fight this moment or say that it shouldn\u2019t be only\nleads to more suffering for you. Radical acceptance means looking at yourself and the situation\nand seeing it as it really is.\nKeep in mind that radical acceptance does not mean that you condone or agree with bad\nbehavior in others. But it does mean that you stop trying to change what\u2019s happened by getting\nangry and blaming the situation. For example, if you\u2019re in an abusive relationship and you need to\nget out, then get out. Don\u2019t waste your time and continue to suffer by blaming yourself or the other\nperson. That won\u2019t help you. Refocus your attention on what you can do now. This will allow you\nto think more clearly and figure out a better way to cope with your suffering.\nRadical Acceptance Coping Statements\nTo help you begin using radical acceptance, it\u2019s often helpful to use a coping statement to\nremind yourself. Below are a few examples and spaces to create your own. Check (\uf0fc) the statements that you would be willing to use to remind yourself that you should accept the present\nmoment and the chain of events that created it. Then, in the next exercise, you\u2019ll begin using the\nstatements that you chose.\n\u201cThis is the way it has to be.\u201d\n\u201cAll the events have led up to now.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t change what\u2019s already happened.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no use fighting the past.\u201d\n\u201cFighting the past only blinds me to my present.\u201d\n\u201cThe present is the only moment I have control over.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a waste of time to fight what\u2019s already occurred.\u201d\n\u201cThe present moment is perfect, even if I don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\u201cThis moment is exactly as it should be, given what\u2019s happened before it.\u201d\n\u201cThis moment is the result of over a million other decisions.\u201d\nOther ideas:\nBasic Distress Tolerance Skills 11\n[Page 21]\nExercise: Radical Acceptance\nNow, using the coping statements that you checked, begin radically accepting different moments\nin your life without judging them. Naturally, it will be difficult to accept very painful situations,\nso start with smaller events. Here are some suggestions. Check (\uf0fc) the ones you\u2019re willing to do,\nand add any of your own ideas. Then use your coping statements to radically accept the situation\nwithout being judgmental or critical.\nRead a controversial story in the newspaper without being judgmental about what has\noccurred.\nThe next time you get caught in heavy traffic, wait without being critical.\nWatch the world news on television without being critical of what\u2019s happening.\nListen to a news story or a political commentary on the radio without being\njudgmental.\nReview a nonupsetting event that happened in your life many years ago, and use\nradical acceptance to remember the event without judging it.\nOther ideas:\nDISTRACT YOuRSELF FROM\nSELF-DESTRuCTIvE BEHAvIORS\nOne of the most important purposes of dialectical behavior therapy is to help you stop engaging in\nself-destructive behaviors, such as cutting, burning, scratching, and mutilating yourself (Linehan,\n1993a). No one can deny the amount of pain you are in when you engage in one of these behaviors.\nSome people with overwhelming emotions say that self-injury temporarily relieves them of some of\nthe pain they\u2019re feeling. This might be true, but it\u2019s also true that these actions can cause serious\npermanent damage and even death if taken to an extreme.\nThink about all the pain you\u2019ve already been through in your life. Think about all the people\nwho have hurt you physically, sexually, emotionally, and verbally. Does it make sense to continue\nhurting yourself even more in the present? Doesn\u2019t it make more sense to start healing yourself\nand your wounds? If you really want to recover from the pain you\u2019ve already experienced, stopping\nthese self-destructive behaviors is the first step you should take. This can be very hard to do. You\nmight be addicted to the rush of natural painkillers called endorphins that are released when you\nhurt yourself. However, these types of self-destructive actions are highly dangerous and certainly\ndeserve your best efforts to control them.\n12 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 22]\nExercise: Distract Yourself from Self-Destructive Behaviors\nHere are some safer actions that you can use to distract yourself from your self-destructive emotions\nand thoughts. Check (\uf0fc) the ones you\u2019re willing to do, and then add any healthy, nonharming\nactivities that you can think of:\nInstead of hurting yourself, hold an ice cube in one hand and squeeze it. The sensation from the cold ice is numbing and very distracting.\nWrite on yourself with a red felt-tip marker instead of cutting. Draw exactly where you\nwould cut. Use red paint or nail polish to make it look like you\u2019re bleeding. Then draw\nstitches with a black marker. If you need to make it even more distracting, squeeze an\nice cube in the other hand at the same time.\nSnap a rubber band on your wrist each time you feel like hurting yourself. This is\nvery painful, but it causes less permanent damage than cutting, burning, or mutilating yourself.\nDig your fingernails into your arm without breaking the skin.\nDraw faces of people you hate on balloons and then pop them.\nWrite letters to people you hate or to people who have hurt you. Tell them what they\ndid to you and tell them why you hate them. Then throw the letters away or save\nthem to read later.\nThrow foam balls, rolled-up socks, or pillows against the wall as hard as you can.\nScream as loud as you can into a pillow or scream some place where you won\u2019t draw\nthe attention of other people, like at a loud concert or in your car.\nStick pins in a voodoo doll instead of hurting yourself. You can make a voodoo doll\nwith some rolled-up socks or a foam ball and some markers. Or you can buy a doll\nin a store for the specific purpose of sticking pins in it. Buy one that\u2019s soft and easy\nto stick.\nCry. Sometimes people do other things instead of crying because they\u2019re afraid that\nif they start to cry they\u2019ll never stop. This never happens. In fact, the truth is that\ncrying can make you feel better because it releases stress hormones.\nOther healthy, nonharming ideas:\nBasic Distress Tolerance Skills 13\n[Page 23]\nHere\u2019s an example of using alternative actions to distract your self-destructive emotions. Lucy\noften cut herself when she felt upset or angry. She had dozens of scars on her wrists and forearms.\nShe wore long-sleeve shirts even in the hot summer because she was embarrassed when other\npeople saw what she had done to herself. But after getting some ideas from this workbook, she\nmade a distraction plan. So the next time she got angry with herself and felt like cutting, she\nlooked at her plan for alternative actions. She had written down the idea of drawing on herself\nwith a red marker. She drew a line exactly where she would have cut herself. She even used red\npaint to make it look like she was bleeding. She carried the mark on her arm for the rest of the\nday to remind herself how sad and overwhelmed she felt. But then, before she went to sleep, she\nwas able to erase the \u201cscar\u201d and \u201cblood\u201d from her arm, unlike the rest of the marks from her\npermanent injuries.\nDISTRACT YOuRSELF WITH PLEASuRABLE ACTIvITIES\nSometimes doing something that makes you feel good is the best way to distract yourself from\npainful emotions. But remember, you don\u2019t have to wait until you feel overwhelmed by painful\nemotions in order to do one of these activities. It\u2019s also helpful to engage in these types of activities\non a regular basis. In fact, you should try to do something pleasurable every day. Exercise is also\nespecially important because not only is it good for your overall physical health but it\u2019s also been\nshown to be an effective treatment for depression in some cases (Babyak et al., 2000). Plus, exercise makes you feel good almost immediately by releasing natural painkillers in your body called\nendorphins (the same painkillers that are released when you cut yourself).\nFollowing is a list of over one hundred pleasurable activities you can use to distract yourself.\n14 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 24]\nTHE BIG LIST OF PLEASuRABLE ACTIvITIES\nCheck (\uf0fc) the ones you\u2019re willing to do, and then add any activities that you can think of:\nTalk to a friend on the telephone.

Karen was feeling lonely\nand had nothing to do. As she sat alone at home, she began to think about how lonely she\u2019d been\nher whole life and how she was hurt by her father when she was growing up. Very quickly, Karen\nwas overwhelmed with very painful emotions. In fact, the memories also triggered physical pain\nin her shoulder. Karen began to cry and didn\u2019t know what to do. Luckily, she remembered the\ndistraction plan she had created. Exercise had always been a powerful tool for Karen, so she went\nfor a long walk in the park while she listened to some of her favorite music. The activity didn\u2019t\nerase her memories or remove her pain completely, but the long walk did soothe her and prevent\nher from being overwhelmed with sadness.\nDISTRACT YOuRSELF BY PAYING ATTENTION\nTO SOMEONE ELSE\nAnother great way to distract yourself from pain is to put your attention on someone else. Here\nare some examples. Check (\uf0fc) the ones you\u2019re willing to do, and then add any activities that you\ncan think of:\nDo something for someone else. Call your friends and ask if they need help doing something, such as a chore, grocery shopping, or housecleaning. Ask your parents, grandparents, or siblings if you can help them with something. Tell them you\u2019re feeling\nbored and you\u2019re looking for something to do. Call up someone you know and offer\nto take them out to lunch. Go outside and give money to the first needy person you\nsee. If you can plan ahead for moments like these when you\u2019re overwhelmed with\npain, call your local soup kitchen, homeless shelter, or volunteer organization. Plan to\nparticipate in activities that help other people. Join a local political activities group,\nenvironmental group, or other organization, and get involved helping other people.\nTake your attention off yourself. Go to a local store, shopping center, bookstore, or park.\nJust sit and watch other people or walk around among them. Watch what they do.\nObserve how they dress. Listen to their conversations. Count the number of buttons\nthey\u2019re wearing on their shirts. Observe as many details about these other people as\nyou can. Count the number of people with blue eyes versus the number of people with\nbrown eyes. When your thinking returns to your own pain, refocus on the details of\nthe people you\u2019re watching.\nThink of someone you care about. Keep a picture of them in your wallet or in your\npurse. This could be your husband, wife, parent, boyfriend, girlfriend, children, or\nfriend, or it could be someone else you admire, such as Mother Teresa, Gandhi, Jesus,\nthe Dalai Lama, Ganesha, and so on. It could even be a movie star, an athlete, or\nsomeone you\u2019ve never met. Then, when you\u2019re feeling distressed, take out the picture\nand imagine a healing, peaceful conversation you would have with that person if you\nBasic Distress Tolerance Skills 17\n[Page 27]\ncould talk to them at that moment when you\u2019re feeling hurt. What would they say to\nyou that would help make you feel better? Imagine them saying those words to you.\nOther ideas:\nHere\u2019s an example of distracting yourself by paying attention to someone else. Louis got upset\nby a fight he had with his boyfriend, Roger. Very quickly, Louis became overwhelmed by sadness\nas he started to remember all the other fights he and Roger had had in the past. Louis went to his\ndesk, where he kept a picture of his mother. He sat down and started to talk to his mother as if\nshe were there with him. He asked for strength and guidance to handle the situation with Roger.\nThen he imagined what she would say to him, and he started to feel better. Later, when he was\nable to think more clearly, he returned to what he needed to do that day.\nDISTRACT YOuR THOuGHTS\nThe human brain is a wonderful thought-producing machine. It turns out millions of thoughts\nevery day. Most of the time, this makes our lives much easier. But unfortunately, we can\u2019t fully\ncontrol what our brain thinks about. Here\u2019s an example. Imagine a picture of your favorite cartoon\ncharacter, such as Bugs Bunny, Snoopy, Superman, or whomever. Close your eyes and see the\ncharacter in vivid detail in your mind\u2019s eye. Remember exactly what it looks like. Think about\nthe character for about fifteen seconds. Got it? Now, for the next thirty seconds do your best not\nto think about the character. Try to block the character from your thoughts. But be honest with\nyourself and notice how often the character pops into your thoughts. It\u2019s impossible not to think\nabout the character. In fact, the harder you try not to think about it, the more power you give to\nthe image and the more your brain keeps bringing it into your thoughts. It\u2019s almost as if the harder\nyou try to forget something, the harder your brain tries to remember it. This is why forcing yourself\nto forget about something that happened to you is impossible. It\u2019s also why you can\u2019t simply force\nyourself to get rid of emotions that you don\u2019t want.\nSo, instead of trying to force yourself to forget a memory or thought, try to distract your\nthoughts with other memories or creative images. Here are some examples. Check (\uf0fc) the ones\nyou\u2019re willing to do, and then add any activities that you can think of:\nRemember events from your past that were pleasant, fun, or exciting. Try to remember\nas many details as possible about these happy memories. What did you do? Who were\nyou with? What happened?\n18 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 28]\nImagine sexual thoughts that make you excited. Create sexual fantasies involving you\nand someone you know or someone you would like to know. Try to think of as many\ndetails as possible. What happens that\u2019s so exciting?\nLook outside at the natural world around you. Observe the flowers, trees, sky, and\nlandscape as closely as you can. Observe any animals that are around. Listen to the\nsounds that they make. Or if you live in a city without much nature around you, either\ndo your best to observe what you can or close your eyes and imagine a scene you\u2019ve\nobserved in the past.\nImagine yourself as a hero or heroine correcting some past or future event in your life.\nHow would you do it? What would people say to you?\nImagine yourself getting praise from someone whose opinion matters to you. What\ndid you do? What does this person say to you? Why does this person\u2019s opinion matter\nto you?\nImagine your wildest fantasy coming true. What would it be? Who else would be\ninvolved? What would you do afterwards?\nKeep a copy of your favorite prayer or favorite saying with you. Then, when you feel\ndistressed, pull it out and read it to yourself. Imagine the words calming and soothing\nyou. Use imagery (such as a white light coming down from heaven or the universe)\nthat soothes you as you read the words.\nOther ideas:\nHere\u2019s an example of using distracting thoughts. Joel was in a bad relationship that often\nreminded him of the way he was treated by his mother. She was always criticizing him and telling\nhim he was wrong. When these memories overwhelmed him, Joel never knew what to do. Sometimes\nhe would just scream at his friends or whoever else was around. But after creating a distraction\nplan, Joel thought of other ideas. The next time he had memories of his mother berating him, he\nwent to his bedroom to lie down. Then he started to imagine himself as a child confronting his\nmother about her abusive language. He told her all the things he wished he could have said to her\nyears ago. He told her she was wrong and that she should stop criticizing him. Joel controlled the\ndetails of the fantasy in the way he wished it could have happened years ago. Afterwards, he slowly\nfelt better. He had escaped the cycle of letting his painful emotions overwhelm him.\nBasic Distress Tolerance Skills 19\n[Page 29]\nDISTRACT YOuRSELF BY LEAvING\nSometimes the best thing that you can do is leave. If you\u2019re in a very painful situation with someone\nand you recognize that your emotions are going to overwhelm you and possibly make the situation\nworse than it is already, then often it\u2019s best to just leave. Remember, if you\u2019re already overwhelmed\nby your emotions, it will be harder for you to think of a healthy resolution to your problem. Maybe\nit\u2019s best to put some distance between you and the situation in order to give yourself time to calm\nyour emotions and think of what to do next. Just walk away if that\u2019s the best you can do. It will\nbe better than adding fuel to the emotional fire.\nHere\u2019s an example of leaving to distract yourself. Anna was in a large department store shopping for a blouse. She wanted one of the clerks to help her find her size, but the store clerk was\nbusy with other customers. Anna waited as long as she could and kept trying to get the clerk\u2019s\nattention, but nothing worked. Anna recognized that she was getting angry very quickly. She was\nready to tear the blouse in half. She didn\u2019t know what else to do. In the past, she would have\nstayed in the store and gotten angrier, but this time she remembered to leave. She walked out of\nthe store, did some shopping elsewhere, and returned to get the blouse later, when the store was\nless crowded and when she was feeling more in control of her behaviors.\nDISTRACT YOuRSELF WITH TASKS AND CHORES\nStrangely, many people don\u2019t schedule enough time to take care of themselves or their living environments. As a result, tasks and chores go uncompleted. Here, then, is the perfect opportunity to\ndo something to take care of yourself and your environment. The next time you\u2019re in a situation\nin which your emotions become too painful, temporarily distract yourself by engaging in one of\nthe following activities. Check (\uf0fc) the ones you\u2019re willing to do, and then add any activities that\nyou can think of:\nWash the dishes.\nMake phone calls to people you haven\u2019t spoken to recently but not someone you\u2019re\nangry with.\nClean your room or house, or go help a friend with their cleaning or gardening\nproject.\nClean out your closet and donate your old clothes.\nRedecorate a room or at least the walls.\nOrganize your books, CDs, computer desktop, and so forth.\nMake a plan for getting a job if you don\u2019t already have one, or make a plan for finding\na better job.\n20 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 30]\nGo get a haircut.\nGo get a manicure or pedicure, or both.\nGo get a massage.\nWash your or someone else\u2019s car.\nMow the lawn.\nClean your garage.\nWash the laundry.\nDo your homework.\nDo work that you\u2019ve brought home from your job.\nPolish your shoes.\nPolish your jewelry.\nClean the bathtub and then take a bath.\nWater your plants or work in the garden.\nCook dinner for yourself and some friends.\nPay the bills.\nGo to a support meeting, like Narcotics Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous, or\nOvereaters Anonymous.\nOther ideas:\nHere\u2019s an example of using tasks and chores to distract yourself. Mike called his girlfriend\nMichelle to go to a movie. Michelle had already made plans with her friends to do something else.\nMike felt incredibly rejected and abandoned. He started yelling at Michelle, who hung up on him.\nThis made Mike feel worse. He didn\u2019t know what to do. Quickly, he began to feel light-headed and\nconfused, and his emotions became very angry. But this time, instead of calling Michelle back and\narguing, he opened his wallet and pulled out the distraction plan he had made (which you\u2019ll also\ncreate at the end of this chapter). He had written down \u201cget a haircut,\u201d so he walked a half mile\nto his barber. Getting out of his house helped soothe his anger, and when he returned home, he\nhad cooled down enough to call Michelle back to see if she was busy the next day.\nBasic Distress Tolerance Skills 21\n[Page 31]\nDISTRACT YOuRSELF BY COuNTING\nCounting is a simple skill that can really keep your mind busy and help you focus on something\nother than your pain. Here are some examples. Check (\uf0fc) the ones you\u2019re willing to do, and then\nadd any activities that you can think of:\nCount your breaths. Sit in a comfortable chair, put one hand on your belly, and take\nslow, long breaths. Imagine breathing into your stomach instead of your lungs. Feel\nyour belly expand like a balloon with each inhalation. Start counting your breaths.\nWhen you inevitably start thinking about whatever it is that\u2019s causing you pain, return\nyour focus to counting.\nCount anything else. If you\u2019re too distracted by your emotions, simply count the sounds\nthat you\u2019re hearing. This will take your attention outside of yourself. Or try counting the\nnumber of cars that are passing by, the number of sensations that you\u2019re feeling, or anything else you can put a number on, such as the branches of a tree you\u2019re looking at.\nCount or subtract by increments of seven. For example, start with one hundred and\nsubtract seven. Now take that answer and subtract seven more. Keep going. This\nactivity will really distract you from your emotions because it requires extra attention\nand concentration.\nOther counting ideas:\nHere\u2019s an example of using counting to distract yourself. Dawn became upset when her mother\ntold her to help set the table for dinner. \u201cShe\u2019s always telling me what to do,\u201d Dawn thought. She\ncould feel her anger getting worse, so she went to her room and remembered that the last time this\nhappened, counting her breaths had helped soothe her emotions. She sat down and did it again.\nAfter ten minutes, she felt calmer, so she went back to the dining room.\nCREATE YOuR DISTRACTION PLAN\nNow identify those distraction skills that you\u2019re willing to use the next time you\u2019re in a situation\nthat\u2019s causing you pain and discomfort. These chosen skills will make up your distraction plan.\nRemember, these are the first steps you will use in your plan to distract, relax, and cope. Write your\nchosen distraction techniques below. When you\u2019re done, write them down again on a 3 x 5 inch\nnote card or a sticky note to carry around with you in your wallet or purse. Then the next time\nyou\u2019re in a distressing situation, you can pull out the card to remind yourself of your distraction\nplan.\n22 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 32]\nMy dIstractIon plan\n1 .\n2 .\n3 .\n4 .\n5 .\n6 .\n7 .\n8 .\n9 .\n10 .\nRELAx AND SOOTHE YOuRSELF\nNow that you\u2019ve learned some healthy and effective ways to distract yourself when you become\noverwhelmed by painful emotions, you\u2019ll need to learn new ways to help soothe yourself (Johnson,\n1985; Linehan, 1993b). Remember, these next skills will give you the second step in your plan to\ndistract, relax, and cope. The activities in this section will help you relax. Then, later in this book,\nyou\u2019ll learn specific skills to cope with problematic situations. These will include emotion regulation skills, mindfulness skills, and interpersonal effectiveness skills.\nLearning to relax and soothe yourself is very important for many reasons. When you\u2019re\nrelaxed, your body feels better. It also functions in a healthier way. In a state of relaxation, your\nheart beats more slowly and your blood pressure is reduced. Your body is no longer in a state of\nconstant emergency, preparing to either confront a stressful situation or run away from it. As a\nresult, it\u2019s easier for your brain to think of healthier ways to cope with your problems.\nIncluded here are some simple relaxation and soothing activities that utilize your five senses\nof smell, sight, hearing, taste, and touch. These activities are meant to bring you a small amount\nof peace in your life. So if one of these activities doesn\u2019t help you feel relaxed, or makes you feel\nworse, don\u2019t do it. Try something else. And remember, each one of us is different. For example,\nsome people will become more relaxed by listening to music and others will find that taking a hot\nbubble bath works for them. As you explore this list, think about what works best for you and be\nwilling to try something new if it sounds exciting.\nBasic Distress Tolerance Skills 23\n[Page 33]\nSelf-Soothing Using Your Sense of Smell\nSmell is a very powerful sense that can often trigger memories and make you feel a certain\nway. Therefore, it\u2019s very important that you identify smells that make you feel good, not bad. Here\nare some ideas. Check (\uf0fc) the ones you\u2019re willing to do, and then add any activities that you can\nthink of:\nBurn scented candles or incense in your room or house. Find a scent that\u2019s pleasing\nto you.\nWear scented oils, perfume, or cologne that makes you feel happy, confident, or\nsexy.\nCut out perfumed cards from magazines and carry them with you in your handbag\nor wallet.\nGo someplace where the scent is pleasing to you, like a bakery or restaurant.\nBake your own food that has a pleasing smell, like chocolate chip cookies.\nLie down in your local park and smell the grass and outdoor smells.\nBuy fresh-cut flowers or seek out flowers in your neighborhood.\nHug someone whose smell makes you feel calm.\nOther ideas:\nSelf-Soothing Using Your Sense of Vision\nVision is very important to humans. In fact, a large portion of our brain is devoted solely to\nour sense of sight. The things you look at can often have very powerful effects on you, for better\nor for worse. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to find images that have a very soothing effect on you. And\nagain, for each person, it comes down to individual taste and preference. Here are some ideas.\nCheck (\uf0fc) the ones you\u2019re willing to do, and then add any activities that you can think of:\nGo through magazines and books to cut out pictures that you like. Make a collage of\nthem to hang on your wall or keep some of them with you in your handbag or wallet\nto look at when you\u2019re away from home.\nFind a place that\u2019s soothing for you to look at, like a park or a museum. Or find a\npicture of a place that\u2019s soothing for you to look at, like the Grand Canyon.\n24 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 34]\nGo to the bookstore and find a collection of photographs or paintings that you find\nrelaxing, such as the nature photographs of Ansel Adams.\nDraw or paint your own picture that\u2019s pleasing to you.\nCarry a picture or photograph of someone you love, someone you find attractive, or\nsomeone you admire.\nOther ideas:\nSelf-Soothing Using Your Sense of Hearing\nCertain sounds can soothe us. Listening to gentle music, for example, may be relaxing. In\nfact, this entire chapter was written while listening to classical music. However, each one of us\nhas our own tastes. You have to find what works best for you. Use these examples to identify the\nsounds that help you relax. Check (\uf0fc) the ones you\u2019re willing to do, and then add any activities\nthat you can think of:\nListen to soothing music. This can be classical, opera, oldies, new age, Motown, jazz,\nCeltic, African, or anything else that works for you. It might be music with singing or\nwithout. Go to a music store that lets you listen to music before you buy it, and listen\nto a wide variety of genres to determine what helps you relax. If you have a portable\nradio or an MP3 player, carry it with you to listen to music when you\u2019re away from\nhome.\nListen to books on tape or compact discs. Many public libraries will let you borrow\nbooks on tape. Take some out to see if it helps you relax. You don\u2019t even have to pay\nattention to the story line. Sometimes just listening to the sound of someone talking\ncan be very relaxing. Again, keep some of these recordings with you in your car or\nloaded in your portable stereo.\nTurn on the television and just listen. Find a show that\u2019s boring or sedate, not something like Jerry Springer that\u2019s just going to get you angry. Sit in a comfortable chair\nor lie down, and then close your eyes and just listen. Make sure you turn the volume\ndown to a level that\u2019s not too loud. Years ago there was a show on public television\nfeaturing a painter named Bob Ross. His voice was so soothing and relaxing that\nmany people reported falling asleep while watching him. Find a show like this that\nwill help you relax.\nListen to a gentle talk show on the radio. Remember\u2014a gentle talk show, not something that\u2019s going to make you upset or angry. Stay away from political talk shows\nBasic Distress Tolerance Skills 25\n[Page 35]\nand the news. Find something neutral in discussion, like Car Talk on National Public\nRadio or a gardening show. Again, sometimes just listening to someone else talk can\nbe relaxing. Carry a portable radio with you to listen to when you\u2019re feeling upset or\nangry.\nOpen your window and listen to the peaceful sounds outside. Or, if you live in a\nplace without relaxing sounds outside, go visit a place with relaxing sounds, such as\na park.\nListen to a recording of nature sounds, such as birds and other wildlife. You can often\nbuy these in a music store and then take them with you to listen to on your portable\ncompact disc player, cassette player, or MP3 device.\nListen to a white-noise machine. White noise is a sound that blocks out other distracting sounds. You can buy a machine that makes white noise with circulating air, or\nyou can turn on a fan to block out distracting sounds. Other white-noise machines\nhave recorded sounds on them, such as the sounds of birds, waterfalls, and rain forests.\nMany people find these machines very relaxing.\nListen to the sound of a personal water fountain. These small electronic fountains can\nbe bought in most department stores, and many people find the sound of the trickling\nwater in their homes to be very soothing.\nListen to a recording of a relaxation exercise. Exercises such as these will help you\nimagine yourself relaxing in many different ways. Other recorded exercises can even\nteach you self-hypnosis techniques to help you relax. Recordings like these can be\nbought at some bookstores and online at self-help publishers, such as New Harbinger\nPublications. Go to www.newharbinger.com and look under \u201cAudio Programs.\u201d Then\nyou can take the programs with you to listen to when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\nListen to the sound of rushing or trickling water. Maybe your local park has a waterfall, or the nearby mall has a fountain. Or maybe just sit in your bathroom with the\nwater running.\nOther ideas:\nSelf-Soothing Using Your Sense of Taste\nTaste is also a very powerful sense. Our tongue has distinct regions of taste buds on it to\ndifferentiate flavors and tastes of food. These sensations can also trigger memories and feelings,\nso again, it\u2019s important that you find the tastes that are pleasing to you. However, if eating is a\n26 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 36]\nproblem for you, such as eating too much, bingeing, purging, or restricting what you eat, talk to a\nprofessional counselor about getting help for yourself. If the process of eating can make you upset\nor nervous, use your other senses to calm yourself. But if food soothes you, use some of these suggestions. Check (\uf0fc) the ones you\u2019re willing to do, and then add any activities you can think of:\nEnjoy your favorite meal, whatever it is. Eat it slowly so you can enjoy the way it\ntastes.\nCarry lollipops, gum, or other candy with you to eat when you\u2019re feeling upset.\nEat a soothing food, like ice cream, chocolate, pudding, or something else that makes\nyou feel good.\nDrink something soothing, such as tea, coffee, or hot chocolate. Practice drinking it\nslowly so you can enjoy the way it tastes.\nSuck on an ice cube or an ice pop, especially if you\u2019re feeling warm, and enjoy the\ntaste as it melts in your mouth.\nBuy a piece of ripe and juicy fresh fruit and then eat it slowly.\nOther ideas:\nSelf-Soothing Using Your Sense of Touch\nWe often forget about our sense of touch, and yet we\u2019re always touching something, such\nas the clothes we\u2019re wearing or the chair we\u2019re sitting in. Our skin is our largest organ, and it\u2019s\ncompletely covered with nerves that carry feelings to our brain. Certain tactile sensations can be\npleasing, like petting a soft dog, while other sensations are shocking or painful in order to communicate danger, like touching a hot stove. Again, each of us prefers different sensations. You have\nto find the ones that are most pleasing for you. Here are some suggestions. Check (\uf0fc) the ones\nyou\u2019re willing to do, and then add any activities that you can think of:\nCarry something soft or velvety in your pocket to touch when you need to, like a\npiece of cloth.\nTake a hot or cold shower and enjoy the feelings of the water falling on your skin.\nTake a warm bubble bath or a bath with scented oils and enjoy the soothing s ensations\non your skin.\nBasic Distress Tolerance Skills 27\n[Page 37]\nGet a massage. Many people who have survived physical and sexual abuse do not\nwant to be touched by anyone. This is understandable. But not all types of massage\nrequire you to take off your clothes. Some techniques, such as traditional Japanese\nshiatsu massage, simply require you to wear loose-fitting clothes. A shoulder and neck\nmassage, received while seated in a massage chair, can also be done without removing\nany clothes. If this is a concern for you, just ask the massage therapist what kind of\nmassage would be best to have while wearing your clothes.\nMassage yourself. Sometimes just rubbing your own sore muscles is very pleasing.\nPlay with your pet. Owning a pet can have many health benefits. Pet owners often\nhave lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol levels, and reduced risk for heart disease\n(Anderson, Reid, & Jennings, 1992), and they experience other general health improvements (Serpell, 1991). In addition, playing with your pet and stroking the animal\u2019s\nfur or skin can provide you with a soothing tactile experience. If you don\u2019t have a\npet, consider getting one. Or if you can\u2019t afford one, visit a friend who has a pet or\nvolunteer at your local animal shelter where you can play with the rescued animals.\nWear your most comfortable clothes, like your favorite worn-in T-shirt, baggy sweat\nsuit, or old jeans.\nOther ideas:\nCREATE A RELAxATION PLAN\nNow that you\u2019ve read the suggestions to help you relax and soothe yourself using your five senses,\nconstruct a list of techniques you\u2019re willing to use. For ideas, review the activities that you checked.\nBe specific about what you\u2019re going to do. Make a list of ideas to try at home and a list of ideas\nyou can take with you when you\u2019re away from home.\nrelaxatIon and soothIng skIlls to use at hoMe\n1 .\n2 .\n3 .\n4 .\n28 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 38]\n5 .\n6 .\n7 .\n8 .\n9 .\n10 .\nKeep this list in a convenient place that\u2019s easy to remember. You might even want to copy this\nlist and put it in places where you see it all the time, such as on your refrigerator, above your desk,\non the mirror in your bathroom, or next to your bed. This way you\u2019ll remind yourself to relax and\nsoothe yourself as often as possible. It will also make it easier to soothe yourself when your painful\nemotions overwhelm you and prevent you from thinking clearly.\nNow create a similar list to use when you\u2019re away from home. Again, review the soothing\nskills you checked in the last few pages to give you ideas. But make sure that it\u2019s possible to use\nthese skills when you\u2019re away from home. For example, don\u2019t list \u201ctake a hot bath\u201d because, most\nlikely, there won\u2019t be a hot bath available to you when you\u2019re not at home.\nrelaxatIon and soothIng skIlls to use away froM hoMe\n1 .\n2 .\n3 .\n4 .\n5 .\n6 .\n7 .\n8 .\n9 .\n10 .\nNow copy these last ten ideas on an index card to remind you what to do when you\u2019re away\nfrom home. Keep this list with you, in your car, in your wallet, or in your handbag. Then make\nBasic Distress Tolerance Skills 29\n[Page 39]\nsure you have whatever\u2019s needed with you, such as candy, a portable radio, pictures, and so forth.\nThis way you can practice relaxing when you\u2019re not at home, especially when your painful emotions\noverwhelm you and prevent you from thinking clearly.\nCONCLuSION\nYou\u2019ve now learned some basic distraction and relaxation skills. You should begin using these skills\nimmediately when you become overwhelmed with painful emotions. The next chapter will build\non these skills and teach you more advanced distraction and relaxation skills.\n30 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 40]\nchapter 2\nAdvanced Distress Tolerance Skills:\nImprove the Moment\nIn the last chapter, you learned many important skills that you can use in a crisis. These skills\nwill distract you from painful situations and then help you soothe yourself and relax so that you\ncan deal with the situation in a more effective way. Remember, your plan for handling a crisis is\nto distract, relax, and cope.\nNow that you\u2019ve been practicing the distress tolerance skills from the last chapter, you\u2019ll be\nready for the advanced distress tolerance skills found in this chapter. These techniques will help\nyou feel more empowered when you encounter painful situations in the future, and they\u2019ll help you\nbuild a more relaxing and fulfilling life for yourself.\nAfter trying each technique, mark the ones that are helpful so you can identify them later.\nSAFE-PLACE vISuALIzATION\nSafe-place visualization is a powerful stress-reduction technique. Using it, you can soothe yourself\nby imagining a peaceful, safe place where you can relax. The truth is, your brain and body often\ncan\u2019t tell the difference between what\u2019s really happening to you and what you\u2019re just imagining.\nSo if you can successfully create a peaceful, relaxing scene in your thoughts, your body will often\nrespond to those soothing ideas.\nMake sure you conduct this exercise in a quiet room where you\u2019ll be free from distractions.\nTurn off your phone, television, and radio. Tell the people in your home, if there are any, that\nyou can\u2019t be disturbed for the next twenty minutes. Allow yourself the time and the freedom\nto relax. You deserve it. Read the following directions before you begin. If you feel comfortable\nremembering them, close your eyes and begin the visualization exercise. Or, if you would prefer,\n[Page 41]\nuse an audio- recording device to record the directions for yourself. Read them aloud using a slow,\nsoothing voice. Then close your eyes and listen to the guided visualization you created.\nBefore you begin the exercise, think of a real or imaginary place that makes you feel safe\nand relaxed. It can be a real place that you\u2019ve visited in the past, such as the beach, a park, a\nfield, a church/temple, your room, and so on. Or it can be a place that you\u2019ve completely made\nup, such as a white cloud floating in the sky, a medieval castle, or the surface of the moon. It can\nbe anywhere. If you have trouble thinking of a place, think of a color that makes you feel relaxed,\nsuch as pink or baby blue. Just do your best. In the exercise, you\u2019ll be guided through exploring\nthis place in more detail. But before you begin, make sure you already have a place in mind, and\nremember\u2014thinking of it should make you feel safe and relaxed.\nComplete the following sentences about your safe place before beginning the visualization:\n\u000e My safe place is\n\u000e My safe place makes me feel\nInstructions\nTo begin, sit in a comfortable chair with your feet flat on the floor and your hands resting comfortably, either on the arms of the chair or in your lap. Close your eyes. Take a slow, long breath in\nthrough your nose. Feel your belly expand like a balloon as you breathe in. Hold it for five seconds: 1,\n2, 3, 4, 5. Then release it slowly through your mouth. Feel your belly collapse like a balloon losing its\nair. Again, take a slow, long breath in through your nose and feel your stomach expand. Hold it for five\nseconds: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then exhale slowly through your mouth. One more time: take a slow, long breath\nin through your nose and feel your stomach expand. Hold it for five seconds: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then exhale\nslowly through your mouth. Now begin to take slow, long breaths without holding them, and continue to\nbreathe smoothly for the rest of this exercise.\nNow, with your eyes closed, imagine that you enter your safe place using all of your senses to ground\nyourself in the scene.\nFirst, look around using your imaginary sense of sight. What does this place look like? Is it daytime\nor nighttime? Is it sunny or cloudy? Notice the details. Are you alone or are there other people or animals?\nWhat are they doing? If you\u2019re outside, look up and notice the sky. Look out at the horizon. If you\u2019re\ninside, notice what the walls and the furniture look like. Is the room light or dark? Choose something\nsoothing to look at. Then continue looking for a few seconds using your imaginary sense of sight.\nNext, use your imaginary sense of hearing. What do you hear? Do you hear other people or animals?\nDo you hear music? Do you hear the wind or the ocean? Choose something soothing to hear. Then listen\nfor a few seconds using your imaginary sense of hearing.\nThen use your imaginary sense of smell. If you\u2019re inside, what does it smell like? Does it smell fresh?\nDo you have a fire burning that you can smell? Or, if you\u2019re outside, can you smell the air, the grass,\nthe ocean, or the flowers? Choose to smell something soothing in your scene. Then take a few seconds to\nuse your imaginary sense of smell.\n32 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 42]\nNext, notice if you can feel anything with your imaginary sense of touch. What are you sitting or\nstanding on in your scene? Can you feel the wind? Can you feel something you\u2019re touching in the scene?\nChoose to touch something soothing in your scene. Then take a few seconds to use your imaginary sense\nof touch.\nLast, use your imaginary sense of taste. Are you eating or drinking anything in this scene? Choose\nsomething soothing to taste. Then take a few seconds to use your imaginary sense of taste.\nNow take a few more seconds to explore your safe place using all of your imaginary senses. Recognize\nhow safe and relaxed you feel here. Remember that you can come back to this place in your imagination\nwhenever you need to feel safe and relaxed. You can also come back whenever you\u2019re feeling sad, angry,\nrestless, or in pain. Look around one last time to remember what it looks like.\nNow keep your eyes closed and return your focus to your breathing. Again, take some slow, long\nbreaths in through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Then, when you feel ready, open your eyes\nand return your focus to the room.\nCuE-CONTROLLED RELAxATION\nCue-controlled relaxation is a quick and easy technique that will help you reduce your stress level\nand muscle tension. A cue is a trigger or command that helps you relax. In this case, your cue\nwill be a word, like \u201crelax\u201d or \u201cpeace.\u201d The goal of this technique is to train your body to release\nmuscle tension when you think about your cue word. Initially, you\u2019ll need the help of the guided\ninstructions to help you release muscle tension in different sections of your body. But after you\u2019ve\nbeen practicing this technique for a few weeks, you\u2019ll be able to relax your whole body at one time\nsimply by taking a few slow breaths and thinking about your cue word. With practice, this can\nbecome a very quick and easy technique to help you relax. Before you begin, choose a cue word\nthat will help you relax.\n\u000e My cue word is\nTo begin this exercise, you\u2019ll need to find a comfortable chair to sit in. Later, after you\u2019ve\npracticed this exercise for a few weeks, you\u2019ll be able to do it wherever you are, even if you\u2019re standing. You\u2019ll also be able to do it more quickly. But to begin, choose a comfortable place to sit in a\nroom where you won\u2019t be disturbed. Make sure you\u2019ll be free from distractions. Turn off your phone,\ntelevision, and radio. Tell the people in your home, if there are any, that you can\u2019t be disturbed\nfor the next twenty minutes. Allow yourself the time and the freedom to relax. You deserve it.\nRead the following directions before you begin. If you feel comfortable remembering them, close\nyour eyes and begin the relaxation exercise. Or, if you would prefer, use an audio-recording device\nto record the directions for yourself. Then close your eyes and listen to the guided relaxation\ntechnique that you created.\nAdvanced Distress Tolerance Skills: Improve the Moment 33\n[Page 43]\nInstructions\nTo begin, sit in a comfortable chair with your feet flat on the floor and your hands resting comfortably, either on the arms of the chair or in your lap. Close your eyes. Take a slow, long breath in\nthrough your nose. Feel your belly expand like a balloon as you breathe in. Hold it for five seconds: 1,\n2, 3, 4, 5. Then release it slowly through your mouth. Feel your belly collapse like a balloon losing its\nair. Again, take a slow, long breath in through your nose and feel your stomach expand. Hold it for five\nseconds: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then exhale slowly through your mouth. One more time: take a slow, long breath\nin through your nose and feel your stomach expand. Hold it for five seconds: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then exhale\nslowly through your mouth. Now begin to take slow, long breaths without holding them, and continue to\nbreathe smoothly for the rest of this exercise.\nNow, with your eyes still closed, imagine that a white beam of light shines down from the sky like\na bright laser and lands on the very top of your head. Notice how warm and soothing the light makes\nyou feel. This could be a light from God, the universe, or whatever power makes you feel comfortable.\nAs you continue to breathe smoothly, taking slow, long breaths, notice how the light makes you feel more\nand more relaxed as it continues to shine on the top of your head. Now, slowly, the warm, white light\nbegins to spread over the top of your head like soothing water. And as it does, the light begins to loosen\nany muscle tension that you\u2019re feeling on the top of your head. Slowly the light begins to slide down your\nbody, and as it moves across your forehead, all the muscle tension there is released. Then the white light\ncontinues down past your ears, the back of your head, your eyes, nose, mouth, and chin, and it continues\nto release any tension you\u2019re holding there. Notice how pleasantly warm your forehead feels. Now, slowly,\nimagine that the light begins to move down your neck and over your shoulders, releasing any muscle\ntension. Then the light slowly proceeds down both of your arms and the front and back of your torso.\nFeel the muscles in your upper and lower back release. Notice the soothing sensation of the white light as\nit moves across your chest and stomach. Feel the muscles in your arms release as the light moves down\nto your forearm and then across both sides of your hands to your fingertips. Now notice the light moving\ndown through your pelvis and buttocks and feel the tension being released. Again, feel the light move like\nsoothing water across your upper and lower legs until it spreads across both the upper and lower surfaces\nof your feet. Feel all of the tension leaving the muscles of your body as the white light makes your body\nfeel warm and relaxed.\nContinue to notice how peaceful and calm you feel as you continue to take slow, long, smooth\nbreaths. Observe how your stomach continues to expand as you inhale, and feel it deflate as you exhale.\nNow, as you continue breathing, silently think to yourself \u201cbreathe in\u201d as you inhale, and then silently\nthink your cue word as you exhale. (If your cue word is something other than \u201crelax,\u201d use that word in\nthe following instructions.) Slowly inhale and think: \u201cbreathe in.\u201d Slowly exhale and think: \u201crelax.\u201d As\nyou do, notice your entire body feeling relaxed at the same time. Feel all the muscle tension in your body\nbeing released as you focus on your cue word. Again, inhale and think: \u201cbreathe in.\u201d Exhale and think:\n\u201crelax.\u201d Notice your entire body releasing any muscle tension. Again, inhale \u2026 \u201cbreathe in.\u201d Exhale \u2026\n\u201crelax.\u201d Feel all the tension in your body releasing.\nContinue breathing and thinking these words at your own pace for several minutes. With each\nbreath, notice how relaxed your entire body feels. When your mind begins to wander, return your focus\nto the words \u201cbreathe in\u201d and \u201crelax.\u201d\n34 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 44]\nPractice the cue-controlled relaxation technique twice a day, and record how long it takes\nyou to feel relaxed. With daily practice, this technique should help you relax more quickly each\ntime. Again, remember that the ultimate goal of this technique is to train your entire body to relax\nsimply when you think of your cue word, such as \u201crelax.\u201d This will only come with regular practice.\nInitially, you might also have to think of the white-light imagery and engage in slow, deep breathing to help yourself relax. But with practice this technique can help you relax in many distressing\nsituations. You can also combine this exercise with the previous safe-place visualization. Engaging\nin cue-controlled relaxation first will help you feel even more safe and calm in that visualization\nprocess.\nREDISCOvER YOuR vALuES\nThe word \u201cvalues\u201d can be defined as your ethics, principles, ideals, standards, or morals. These are\nliterally the ideas, concepts, and actions that fill your life with worth and importance. Remembering\nwhat you value in life can be a very powerful way to help you tolerate a stressful situation. It can\nalso be particularly helpful when you find yourself upset over and over again in the same situation\nor with the same person. Sometimes we forget why we\u2019re doing something that\u2019s hard, and this\nmakes it difficult for us to continue. Maybe you have a job that you don\u2019t like and you wonder\nwhy you keep going to work. Perhaps you\u2019re going to school, and you don\u2019t remember what your\ngoals are. Or maybe you\u2019re in a relationship that isn\u2019t fulfilling, and you wonder why you keep\nmaintaining that relationship. In cases like these, remembering what you value can help you tolerate stressful situations and also help you create a more fulfilling life for yourself. Use the following\nexercises to explore what you value in life.\nExercise: valued Living Questionnaire\nThis first exercise will ask you to identify how you value ten different components of your life\nusing the Valued Living Questionnaire (Wilson, 2002; Wilson & Murrell, 2004). As you read\neach component, ask yourself how important each of these areas is to your life\u2014regardless of how\nmuch time or effort you now put into fulfilling the needs of that area. For example, maybe you\nhighly value \u201cself-care\u201d regardless of the fact that you devote little time to it. Rate the importance\nof each component on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being not important at all and 10 being extremely\nimportant. Do your best to rate them honestly, according to your own true feelings, not to what\nyou think you should rate them. You\u2019ll then use your responses to the Valued Living Questionnaire\nin the following exercise, which will help you move toward engaging in what you value.\nAdvanced Distress Tolerance Skills: Improve the Moment 35\n[Page 45]\n36 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\nERIANNOITSEuQ\nGNIvIL\nDEuLAv\n)2002\n,nosliW(\nylemertxE\nyletaredoM\ntnatropmI\ntoN\ntnenopmoC\nefiL\ntropmI\ntnatropmI\nllA\nta\ntna ro\nspihsnoitaler\ncitnamor\nnaht\nrehto(\nylimaF\n)gnitnerap ,srentrap\nefil\n,egairram(\nspihsnoitaler\ncitnamoR\n)no\nos\ndna\n,gnitad gnitneraP efil\nlaicos\ndna\nsdneirF kroW gniniart\ndna\nnoitacudE nuf\ndna\nnoitaerceR noigiler\ndna\nytilautiripS efil\nytinummoc\ndna\npihsnezitiC )no\nos\ndna\n,noitaxaler\n,teid\n,esicrexe(\nerac-fleS\n[Page 46]\nExercise: Committed Action\nThis next exercise will help you create a more fulfilling life for yourself by formulating intentions\nand committed actions based on your values (Olerud & Wilson, 2002). Maybe you already dedicate\na lot of time to the components of your life that you value, or maybe you don\u2019t. Either way, this\nexercise will help you think about ways to make your life feel more fulfilling based on what you\nthink is important.\nFirst, using the Valued Living Questionnaire, identify the components of your life that you\nrated between 5 and 10, from moderately important to extremely important. Then fill in the names\nof those areas on the Committed Action Worksheet that follows the questionnaire. (Make additional photo copies of this worksheet if you need more space.)\nNext, identify one intention for each of those valued components, which will help make your\nlife feel more fulfilling. For example, if you rated education highly, maybe your intention would be\n\u201cto go back to school.\u201d Or if you rated romantic relationships highly, maybe your intention would\nbe \u201cto spend more time with my spouse or partner.\u201d\nThen, finally, identify several actions you are willing to commit to doing that will move you\ntoward your intention. Also, note when you\u2019re willing to begin that commitment. For example, if\nyour intention is to go back to school, the actions you list might include \u201cgetting a catalog of classes\nnext week\u201d and \u201csigning up for a class within the next three weeks.\u201d If your intention is to spend\nmore time with your spouse, your committed actions might include \u201cnot working overtime for the\nnext month\u201d and \u201cspending less time with friends for the next two weeks.\u201d\nAgain, the purpose of these exercises is to fill your life with activities that are important to\nyou. Creating a life that you value can often help you deal with other situations that are distressing\nand less desirable. Having a fulfilling life can give you something to look forward to when you\u2019re\ndoing something you don\u2019t like, and it can make you feel stronger during times of distress.\nAdvanced Distress Tolerance Skills: Improve the Moment 37\n[Page 47]\nCOMMITTED ACTION WORKSHEET\n(Adapted from Olerud & Wilson, 2002)\n1 .

This is what people mean when they talk about believing in a \u201chigher power\u201d or seeing \u201cthe big picture\u201d in life. Believing in something divine, holy, or\nspecial can help you endure stressful situations as well as help you soothe yourself.\nAt some point in life, we all feel hopeless or powerless. We\u2019ve all experienced unfortunate\nsituations during which we felt alone and needed strength. Sometimes unexpected circumstances\nhurt us or the people we care about. These situations often include being the victim of a crime,\ngetting into an accident, having someone close to us die, or being diagnosed with a serious illness.\nHaving faith in something special during times like these can often help you feel connected to a\nbigger purpose in life. And remember, your faith doesn\u2019t have to involve God if that\u2019s not what\nyou believe in. Some people only put their faith in the goodness of the people they love. Yet basic\nbeliefs like these are often powerful enough to help people find the strength and comfort to lead\nhappy, healthy lives.\nWhile you\u2019re exploring your spirituality, remember that your spiritual beliefs can change over\ntime. Sometimes a person is raised in a spiritual tradition that no longer makes sense or feels\nhelpful. Yet, despite these feelings, a person will sometimes continue to attend the services of that\ntradition because he or she thinks \u201cit\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d The truth is, if your spiritual tradition is no longer giving you peace and strength, it\u2019s okay to reexamine that faith and to change\ntraditions if necessary.\nConnect to Your Higher Power\nUse the following questions to help you identify your beliefs and to identify some ways in\nwhich you can strengthen and use your beliefs on a regular basis:\n\u000e What are some of your beliefs about a higher power or a big picture that give you\nstrength and comfort?\n\u000e Why are these beliefs important to you?\nAdvanced Distress Tolerance Skills: Improve the Moment 39\n[Page 49]\n\u000e How do these beliefs make you feel?\n\u000e How do these beliefs make you think about others?\n\u000e How do these beliefs make you think about life in general?\n\u000e How do you acknowledge your beliefs throughout your daily life? For example, do you\ngo to church, synagogue, or temple? Do you pray? Do you talk to other people about\nyour beliefs? Do you read books about your beliefs? Do you help other people?\n\u000e What else would you be willing to do in order to strengthen your beliefs?\n\u000e What can you do to remind yourself of your beliefs on a regular basis?\n\u000e What can you say or do to remind yourself of your beliefs the next time you\u2019re\nfeeling distressed?\n40 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 50]\nExercise: Higher-Power Activities\nHere are some additional activities to help you feel more connected to your higher power, the\nuniverse, and the big picture. Check (\uf0fc) the ones that you\u2019re willing to do:\nIf you do believe in the teachings of a particular religion or faith, find related activities that make\nyou feel more empowered and calm. Go to your church, synagogue, or temple for services.\nTalk to the man or woman who runs your services. Talk to other members of your faith\nabout how they\u2019ve handled difficult experiences. Join discussion groups formed at your place\nof worship. Read the books that are important to your faith. Find passages that give you\nstrength, and mark them or copy them to keep with you in your wallet or purse so you can\nread them no matter where you are.\nRemember that your higher power can also be something other than God. Your higher power\ncan be a person who makes you feel stronger and more confident to deal with the challenges that you face. Think of someone you admire who can be your higher power. Describe\nthat person. What makes that person special? Then, the next time you\u2019re in a difficult or\ndistressing situation, act as if you are that person, and notice how you handle the situation\ndifferently.\nLook up at the stars. The light you\u2019re seeing is millions of years old, and it has traveled\nfrom stars that are billions of miles away. In fact, each time you look up at the stars, you\u2019re\nlooking through a time machine and seeing the universe as it looked billions of years ago.\nStrangely, many of the stars you\u2019re looking at have already died, but their light is just reaching your eyes on the Earth. Look up at the stars and recognize that whatever created them\nalso created you, whether it was God or a cosmic accident. You are connected to the stars.\nImagine yourself connecting with the universe. Sit in a comfortable chair, close your eyes,\nand imagine a white beam of light shining down from the universe. Like a laser beam,\nthe white light shines on the top of your head and fills you with a feeling of peace. Now\nimagine the white light spreading all over your body, relaxing every muscle. Now imagine\nyour legs stretching down through the floor like giant tree trunks, going all the way down\ninto the center of the Earth. Imagine these roots tapping into the energy that drives the\nplanet. Feel your body fill with confidence as your legs absorb the golden energy flowing\nup from the Earth.\nAdvanced Distress Tolerance Skills: Improve the Moment 41\n[Page 51]\nThink about our planet Earth. Water is the most important substance for sustaining life on\nour planet. Yet if we were much closer to the sun, all the water on our planet would evaporate because the temperature would be too hot, and if we were much farther away, all the\nwater would freeze because the temperature would be too cold. Somehow, we\u2019ve been lucky\nenough to be in just the right place for life to form. Even if you don\u2019t believe in a religious\npurpose, ask yourself what it means that you live on a planet with just the right climate and\nelements for life to exist. How did this happen, and what does it mean about your life?\nGo to the beach. Try to count the grains in a handful of sand. Now try to imagine how\nmany handfuls of sand there are in the world, on all the beaches and in all the deserts. Try\nto imagine how many billions of years must have passed to create so many grains of sand.\nAnd again, recognize that the chemical elements that make up the sand also exist in you.\nStand with your feet in the sand and imagine feeling connected to the planet.\nGo to a park or to a field and observe the trees, the grass, and the animals. Again, recognize\nthat whatever created all of that also created you. Remember that all living things are made\nof the same chemical elements. On a subatomic scale, there isn\u2019t much difference between\nyou and many other life forms. Yet you are still different and special. What is it that makes\nyou unique from other life?\nThink about the human body, especially your own. Each human being is more wonderful than\na piece of artwork and more complex than any computer ever invented. Everything about\nyou is largely determined by your DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the instructions that are\nfound in every cell of your body. Yet amazingly, each set of instructions that creates every\npart of your body is composed of just four chemical elements that are repeated in different\ncombinations. These different combinations are called genes, and these are the instructions\nyou inherit from your parents that determine everything from your eye color to the structure of your heart. Incredibly, it only takes an estimated thirty to forty thousand genes to\ndesign a human being. Imagine trying to write so few instructions in order to create a body\nthat thinks, breathes, eats, moves, and does everything else you do. Plus, remember that\nthis same number of instructions is also responsible for creating approximately 100 billion\nneurons in your brain, 60,000 miles (!) of blood vessels throughout your body, 600 skeletal\nmuscles, 206 bones, 32 teeth, and 11 pints of blood.\nTAKE A TIME-OuT\nTime-outs aren\u2019t just for kids. We all need to relax in order to refresh our bodies, minds, and spirits.\nYet many people don\u2019t take time out for themselves because they feel like they\u2019d be disappointing\nsomeone else, like their boss, spouse, family, or friends. Many people struggle with the constant\nneed to please others, and as a result, they neglect to take care of themselves. But people who don\u2019t\ntake care of themselves lead very unbalanced lives. Many people ignore their own needs because\n42 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 52]\nthey feel guilty or selfish about doing anything for themselves. But how long can you continue to\ntake care of someone else without taking care of yourself? Imagine a woman who stands on a street\ncorner on a hot, summer day holding a jug of cold water. She pours drinks for every pedestrian\nwho walks by and, of course, everyone is grateful. But what happens when she\u2019s thirsty and goes to\nget a drink? After a long day of helping everyone else and neglecting herself, the jug is now empty.\nHow often do you feel like this woman? How often do you run out of time for yourself because\nyou\u2019ve spent all of it taking care of other people? Helping others is a good thing to do as long as\nit doesn\u2019t come at the expense of sacrificing your own health. You need to take care of yourself,\nand that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re selfish.\nExercise: Time-Out\nHere are some simple ideas you can use to take time out for yourself. Check (\uf0fc) the ones you\u2019re\nwilling to do.\nTreat yourself as kindly as you treat other people. Do one nice thing for yourself that you\u2019ve\nbeen putting off.\nTake time to devote to yourself, even if it\u2019s just a few hours during the week, by doing things\nlike taking a walk or preparing your favorite meal.\nOr if you\u2019re feeling really brave, take a half day off from work. Go someplace beautiful, like\na park, the ocean, a lake, the mountains, a museum, or even someplace like a shopping\ncenter.\nTake time to do things for your own life, like shopping, errands, doctor\u2019s appointments,\nand so on.\nOther ideas:\nLIvE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT\nTime travel is possible. We all do it occasionally, but some people do it more often than others.\nPeople who time travel spend a large portion of each day thinking about all the things they\nshould\u2019ve done yesterday, all the things that went wrong in the past, and all the things they\u2019re supposed to do tomorrow. As a result, that\u2019s where they live, in the past or in the future. They rarely\npay attention to what\u2019s happening to them right now, so they miss living in the present moment\u2014\nthe only true moment in which anyone can really live. For example, notice what\u2019s happening to\nAdvanced Distress Tolerance Skills: Improve the Moment 43\n[Page 53]\nyou right now as you read this. Are you thinking of something else? Are you thinking of something\nthat happened in the past or something that\u2019s coming up in the future? What does your body feel\nlike right now? Pay attention to it. Do you notice any spots of tension or physical pain? How are\nyou breathing? Are you taking full, deep breaths, or are you breathing very shallowly?\nOften, we don\u2019t pay attention to what\u2019s happening to us. We don\u2019t pay attention to what\npeople are saying to us or to the things that we read. We don\u2019t even pay attention to who\u2019s around\nus while we\u2019re walking. And to make it even more problematic, we often try to do more than one\nthing at the same time, like driving, eating, and talking on the phone simultaneously. As a result,\nwe miss a lot of what life has to offer and we often make easy situations more difficult.\nBut even worse, not living in the present moment can also make life more painful. For\nexample, maybe you anticipate that the person with whom you\u2019re talking is going to say something\ninsulting, which makes you feel angry\u2014even though the person hasn\u2019t even said anything yet! Or\nmaybe just thinking about past events makes you feel physically or emotionally upset, which then\ninterferes with whatever you\u2019re trying to do at the moment. Obviously, both types of time traveling\ncan make any event unnecessarily painful.\nIn chapters 3 through 5 on mindfulness skills, you\u2019ll learn advanced skills to help you stay in\nthe moment. But for now, try the following exercises to help you live in the moment and tolerate\ndistressing events more skillfully.\nExercise: \u201cWhere Are You Now?\u201d\nThe next time you\u2019re in a distressing situation, ask yourself the following questions:\n\u000e Where am I right now?\n\u000e Am I time traveling in the future, worrying about something that might happen,\nor planning something that might happen?\n\u000e Am I time traveling in the past, reviewing mistakes, reliving bad experiences, or\nthinking about how my life could have been under different circumstances?\n\u000e Or am I in the present, really paying attention to what I\u2019m doing, thinking, and\nfeeling?\nIf you\u2019re not in the present moment, refocus your attention on what\u2019s happening to you now\nby using the following steps:\n\u000e Notice what you\u2019re thinking about and recognize if you\u2019re time traveling. Bring\nyour focus back to the present moment.\n\u000e Notice how you\u2019re breathing. Take slow, long breaths to help you refocus on the\npresent.\n44 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 54]\n\u000e Notice how your body feels and observe any tension or pain you might be feeling.\nRecognize how your thoughts might be contributing to how you\u2019re feeling. Use\ncue-controlled relaxation to release any tension.\n\u000e Notice any painful emotions you might be feeling as a result of time traveling, and\nuse one of the distress tolerance skills to help you relieve any immediate pain.\nExercise: Listening to Now\nAnother exercise to help you refocus on the present moment is the Listening to Now exercise.\nDedicate at least five minutes to help yourself refocus.\nInstructions\nSit in a comfortable chair. Turn off any distractions, like your phone, radio, and television. Take\nslow, long breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Feel your stomach expand like\na balloon each time you breathe in and feel it deflate each time you exhale. Now, as you continue to\nbreathe, simply listen. Listen to any sounds you hear outside your home, inside your home, and inside\nyour own body. Count each sound that you hear. When you get distracted, return your focus to listening.\nMaybe you hear cars, people, or airplanes outside. Perhaps you hear a clock ticking or a fan blowing\ninside. Or maybe you hear the sound of your own heart beating inside your body. Actively and carefully\nlisten to your environment and count as many sounds as you can. Try this exercise for five minutes and\nnotice how you feel afterwards.\nA variation of this listening exercise will help you stay focused on the present moment while\nyou\u2019re in a conversation with another person. If you notice that your attention is beginning to\nwander and you start thinking about your past or future, focus your attention on something that\nthe person is wearing, like a button on their shirt, a hat they\u2019re wearing, or their collar. Note to\nyourself what color the item is and what it looks like. Sometimes this can snap you out of your\ntime traveling. Now continue to listen, and if your mind begins to wander again, do the same\nthing and try to keep listening.\nExercise: Mindful Breathing\nAnother exercise that will help you stay focused in the present moment is breathing. It sounds\nsimple, but we often don\u2019t breathe as well as we should. Think about it: who ever taught you how\nto breathe? If you\u2019re like the rest of us, probably no one. And yet, you do it about fifteen times\na minute or almost 22,000 times a day! Everyone knows that we breathe air to take in oxygen.\nBut how much of the air you breathe is actually oxygen\u2014100 percent, 75 percent? The correct\nanswer is that the air you breathe is only about 21 percent oxygen, and when your body doesn\u2019t\nAdvanced Distress Tolerance Skills: Improve the Moment 45\n[Page 55]\nget enough oxygen it can knock your biological system off balance. For this reason alone, taking\nfull, slow breaths is important. But another benefit of breathing fully is that this simple technique\ncan help you relax and focus. Many spiritual traditions combine slow breathing techniques with\nguided meditations to help people focus and relax.\nHere\u2019s a breathing exercise that many people find helpful. This type of breathing is also called\ndiaphragmatic breathing because it activates the diaphragm muscle at the bottom of your lung cavity.\nEngaging the diaphragm helps you take fuller, deeper breaths, which also helps you relax.\nRead the instructions before beginning the exercise to familiarize yourself with the experience. If you feel more comfortable listening to the instructions, use an audio-recording device to\nrecord the directions in a slow, even voice so that you can listen to them while practicing this\ntechnique. Set a kitchen timer or an alarm clock for five minutes and practice breathing until the\nalarm goes off. Then as you get more accustomed to using this technique to help you relax, you\ncan set the alarm for longer periods of time, like ten or fifteen minutes. But don\u2019t expect to be\nable to sit still that long when you first start. In the beginning, five minutes is a long time to sit\nstill and breathe.\nWhen using this new form of breathing, many people often feel as if they become \u201cone\u201d with\ntheir breathing, meaning that they feel a deep connection to the experience. If that happens for\nyou, great. If not, that\u2019s okay, too. Just keep practicing. Also, some people feel light-headed when\nthey first begin practicing this technique. This may be caused by breathing too fast, too deeply, or\ntoo slowly. Don\u2019t be alarmed. If you begin to feel light-headed, stop if you need to, or return your\nbreathing to a normal rate and begin counting your breaths.\nInstructions\nTo begin, find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won\u2019t be disturbed for as long as\nyou\u2019ve set your timer. Turn off any distracting sounds. Take a few slow, long breaths and relax. Place\none hand on your stomach. Now slowly breathe in through your nose and then slowly exhale through\nyour mouth. Feel your stomach rise and fall as you breathe. Imagine your belly filling up with air like a\nballoon as you breathe in, and then feel it deflate as you breathe out. Feel the breath moving in across\nyour nostrils, and then feel your breath blowing out across your lips. As you breathe, notice the sensations\nin your body. Feel your lungs fill up with air. Notice the weight of your body resting on whatever you\u2019re\nsitting on. With each breath, notice how your body feels more and more relaxed.\nNow, as you continue to breathe, begin counting your breaths each time you exhale. You can count\neither silently to yourself or aloud. Count each exhalation until you reach \u201c4\u201d and then begin counting\nat \u201c1\u201d again. To begin, breathe in slowly through your nose and then exhale slowly through your mouth.\nCount \u201c1.\u201d Again, breathe in slowly through your nose and slowly out through your mouth. Count \u201c2.\u201d\nRepeat, breathing in slowly through your nose, and then slowly exhale. Count \u201c3.\u201d Last time\u2014breathe in\nthrough your nose and out through your mouth. Count \u201c4.\u201d Now begin counting at \u201c1\u201d again.\nWhen your mind begins to wander and you catch yourself thinking of something else, return your\nfocus to counting your breaths. Try not to criticize yourself for getting distracted. Just keep taking slow\nbreaths into your belly, in and out. Imagine filling up your belly with air like a balloon. Feel it rising with\n46 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 56]\neach inhalation and falling with each exhalation. Keep counting each breath, and with each exhale, feel\nyour body relaxing, deeper and deeper.\nKeep breathing until your alarm goes off, and then slowly return your focus to the room you\u2019re in.\nuSE SELF-ENCOuRAGING COPING THOuGHTS\nThere are many distressing times in life when we all need to hear some encouraging words to keep\nus motivated or to help us endure the pain that we\u2019re experiencing. But there are many distressing\ntimes like these when you are also alone, and you need to encourage yourself to stay strong. Often,\nthis can be done with self-encouraging coping thoughts. Coping thoughts are reminders of how\nstrong you\u2019ve been in the past when you survived distressing situations, and they\u2019re also reminders\nof encouraging words that have given you strength. Coping thoughts are especially helpful when\nyou first notice that you\u2019re feeling agitated, nervous, angry, or upset. If you can recognize your distress early on, you\u2019ll have a better chance of using one of these thoughts to help soothe yourself.\nMaybe there are even situations in your life that occur on a regular basis, when you can predict\nthat one of these coping thoughts might be useful.\nlist of Coping Thoughts\nHere is a list of some coping thoughts that many people have found to be helpful (McKay,\nDavis, & Fanning, 1997). Check (\uf0fc) the ones that are helpful to you and create your own.\n\u201cThis situation won\u2019t last forever.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve already been through many other painful experiences, and I\u2019ve survived.\u201d\n\u201cThis too shall pass.\u201d\n\u201cMy feelings make me uncomfortable right now, but I can accept them.\u201d\n\u201cI can be anxious and still deal with the situation.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m strong enough to handle what\u2019s happening to me right now.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for me to learn how to cope with my fears.\u201d\n\u201cI can ride this out and not let it get to me.\u201d\n\u201cI can take all the time I need right now to let go and relax.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve survived other situations like this before, and I\u2019ll survive this one too.\u201d\n\u201cMy anxiety/fear/sadness won\u2019t kill me; it just doesn\u2019t feel good right now.\u201d\n\u201cThese are just my feelings, and eventually they\u2019ll go away.\u201d\nAdvanced Distress Tolerance Skills: Improve the Moment 47\n[Page 57]\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay to feel sad/anxious/afraid sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cMy thoughts don\u2019t control my life, I do.\u201d\n\u201cI can think different thoughts if I want to.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not in danger right now.\u201d\n\u201cSo what?\u201d\n\u201cThis situation sucks, but it\u2019s only temporary.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m strong and I can deal with this.\u201d\nOther ideas:\nCoping thoughts can help you tolerate distressing situations by giving you strength and motivation to endure those experiences. Now that you know about coping thoughts, you can begin\nusing them immediately. Write your five favorite coping thoughts on an index card or a sticky note\nand keep it with you in your wallet or purse. Or put your coping thoughts in conspicuous places\nwhere you can see them every day, like on your refrigerator or mirror. The more you see your\ncoping thoughts, the more quickly they will become part of your automatic thought process.\nUse the following worksheet to record stressful situations in which you use your coping\nthoughts to give you strength. Make copies of the worksheet, and keep one with you so that\nyou can record the experience as soon as it happens. Recording the experience quickly might be\nawkward or inconvenient for you, but doing it this way will help you remember to use your selfencouraging coping thoughts more often. Read the example worksheet for ideas about when coping\nthoughts might be helpful to you.\n48 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 58]\nExAMPLE: uSING COPING THOuGHTS\nDistressing Situation New Coping Thought\n1 .

In dialectical behavior therapy, the balance is between\nchange and acceptance (Linehan, 1993a). You need to change the behaviors in your life that are\ncreating more suffering for yourself and others while simultaneously also accepting yourself the way\nyou are. This might sound contradictory, but it\u2019s a key part of this treatment. Dialectical behavior\ntherapy depends on acceptance and change, not acceptance or change. Most of this book will focus\non skills you can develop to change your life. But this section will focus on how to accept your life.\nIn fact, it will teach you how to radically accept your life.\nRadical acceptance is one of the hardest skills in this chapter to master because it will\nrequire you to look at yourself and the world in a different way. However, it\u2019s also one of the most\nimportant skills in dialectical behavior therapy (Linehan, 1993a). (You\u2019ll be exploring it further in\nchapters 3 through 5 on mindfulness skills.) Radical acceptance means that you accept something\ncompletely, without judging it. For example, radically accepting the present moment means that\nyou don\u2019t fight it, get angry at it, or try to change it into something that it\u2019s not. To radically\naccept the present moment means that you must acknowledge that the present moment is what\nit is due to a long chain of events and decisions made by you and other people in the past. The\npresent moment never spontaneously leaps into existence without being caused by events that have\nalready taken place. Imagine that each moment of your life is connected like a line of dominoes\nthat knock each other down.\nBut remember, radically accepting something doesn\u2019t mean that you give up and simply accept\nevery bad situation that happens to you. Some situations in life are unjust, such as when someone\nabuses or assaults you. But for other situations in life, you share at least some responsibility. There\u2019s\na balance between what you created and what others have created. However, many people struggling with overwhelming emotions often feel like life just \u201chappens\u201d to them, not recognizing their\nown role in creating a situation. As a result, their first reaction is to get angry. In fact, one woman\nsaid that anger was her \u201cdefault emotion,\u201d meaning that when she was just being herself, she was\nangry. Her excessive hostility caused her to hurt herself\u2014by drinking heavily, cutting herself, and\nconstantly berating herself\u2014and it also led to her hurting the people she cared about by constantly\nfighting with them.\nIn contrast, radically accepting the present moment opens up the opportunity for you to\nrecognize the role that you have played in creating your current situation. And as a result, it also\ncreates an opportunity to respond to that situation in a new way that\u2019s less painful for yourself and\nothers. In many ways, radical acceptance is like the Serenity Prayer, which says: \u201cGrant me the\nserenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom\nto know the difference.\u201d In the exercise below, you will find some questions to ask yourself when\nyou want to use radical acceptance. But first, let\u2019s look at an example of how radical acceptance\ncan help a person in a distressing situation.\nAdvanced Distress Tolerance Skills: Improve the Moment 51\n[Page 61]\nexample: Using Radical Acceptance\nChristine and her boyfriend John had a difficult relationship. John spent a lot of his free time\nat the bar drinking with his friends, and in response, Christine would get mad, threaten to leave\nhim, and then do something destructive to \u201cpiss him off.\u201d This occurred regularly for five years.\nThen one night Christine came home from work angry, and when John wasn\u2019t around to talk to,\nshe suddenly felt hopeless about their relationship. So she called John at the bar to tell him that\nshe was going to kill herself because she couldn\u2019t put up with his behavior any longer. John raced\nhome to find Christine swallowing a handful of pills, and he made her spit them out. Then he\nmade her promise that she wouldn\u2019t do it again. She promised, and then John left, taking the keys\nto Christine\u2019s car so that she couldn\u2019t go anywhere. Now Christine got even angrier and called the\npolice to report that her keys had been stolen. Then she walked up to the bar, found John\u2019s car, and\nsmashed his windshield with a brick. She would have broken the other windows too, but the police\nstopped her and arrested her. Needless to say, neither Christine nor John gave any consideration to\nusing radical acceptance in this situation. Both of them were angry at each other, and by acting\non their anger, they both ended up hurting themselves and the other person.\nSo how could this situation have occurred differently if radical acceptance had been used?\nLet\u2019s consider the situation from Christine\u2019s point of view. Instead of threatening to kill herself,\nmaybe she could have used one of the distress tolerance skills you learned in the last chapter.\nRemember your strategy for dealing with distressing situations is to distract, relax, and cope. Maybe\nChristine could have screamed into a pillow and then gone outside for a long walk. Or maybe\nshe could have called one of her friends to talk for a little while. Then after she\u2019d cooled off a\nbit, maybe she could have asked herself the following questions and used radical acceptance to\nreexamine her situation.\n\u000e What events led up to Christine\u2019s situation? She and John had been behaving and\nfighting like this for years. This night was nothing new. But she had come home\nangry about work, and she became even angrier with John because he wasn\u2019t\naround.\n\u000e What role did Christine play in creating this situation? Instead of trying to cope with\nher anger and frustration in a healthy way, she took her emotions out on herself\nand John. Also, Christine had had many reasons and opportunities in the past to\nend this relationship if she wanted to, but she had chosen to stay in this destructive\nrelationship.\n\u000e What role did John play in creating this situation? John had an alcohol addiction that\nhad been interfering with their relationship for five years. This night, he also didn\u2019t\ntake the time to discuss Christine\u2019s suicidal behaviors with her. Instead, he chose\nto return to the bar, which made her even angrier.\n\u000e What does Christine have control of in this situation? She can end the relationship\nif she wants to, or she can choose a different way to cope with this distressing\nsituation.\n52 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 62]\n\u000e What doesn\u2019t Christine have control of in this situation? Ultimately, it is John who has\nto seek help to stop his alcohol addiction. Christine can\u2019t make him stop drinking.\nShe also doesn\u2019t have control of how John chooses to behave toward her in this\nsituation.\n\u000e What was Christine\u2019s response to this situation? She tried to kill herself, and then she\nsmashed John\u2019s windshield.\n\u000e How did her response affect her own thoughts and feelings? Her actions made her feel\nworse about herself and her relationship, and she kept thinking about why she was\nstill in this destructive relationship.\n\u000e How did her response affect the thoughts and feelings of other people? Christine and\nJohn were arrested, which made both of them feel worse than they already did\nabout themselves and their relationship.\n\u000e How could Christine have changed her response to this situation so that it led to less\nsuffering for herself and John? She could have used other distress tolerance skills\nto cope with her pain and anger. She could also have used radical acceptance to\nreevaluate the situation so that she could choose to react in a different way. And\nperhaps she could even have chosen to leave John that evening, even temporarily,\nwhich might have been less painful for the both of them.\n\u000e How could the situation have occurred differently if Christine had decided to radically accept the situation? If she had used some type of distress tolerance skills that\nevening, maybe she could have waited until the next morning to talk to John\nabout how angry she felt at work and how upset his drinking made her feel. Or\nmaybe if she had ended the relationship, she could have made space in her life for a\nhealthier relationship or simply spared herself the reoccurring pain of a destructive\nrelationship.\nExercise: Radical Acceptance\nNow answer the same questions for yourself. Think of a distressing situation that you experienced\nrecently. Then answer these questions that will help you radically accept the situation in a new\nway:\n\u000e What happened in this distressing situation?\nAdvanced Distress Tolerance Skills: Improve the Moment 53\n[Page 63]\n\u000e What past events happened that led up to this situation?\n\u000e What role did you play in creating this situation?\n\u000e What roles did other people play in creating this situation?\n\u000e What do you have control of in this situation?\n\u000e What don\u2019t you have control of in this situation?\n\u000e What was your response to this situation?\n\u000e How did your response affect your own thoughts and feelings?\n\u000e How did your response affect the thoughts and feelings of other people?\n54 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 64]\n\u000e How could you have changed your response to this situation so that it led to less\nsuffering for yourself and others?\n\u000e How could the situation have occurred differently if you had decided to radically\naccept the situation?\nIt\u2019s very important to remember that radical acceptance also applies to accepting yourself. In\nthis case, radical acceptance means embracing who you are without judging or criticizing yourself.\nOr, to put it another way, radically accepting yourself means loving yourself just the way you are,\nwith all of your goodness and all of your faults. Finding the goodness inside of yourself might be a\ndifficult challenge, especially if you\u2019re struggling with overwhelming emotions. Many people with\nthis problem often think of themselves as being defective, bad, or unlovable. As a result, they overlook their good qualities and add more pain to their lives. This is why radically accepting yourself\nis so extremely important.\nSELF-AFFIRMING STATEMENTS\nTo begin building a healthier self-image, many people find it helpful to use self-affirming statements. The purpose of these statements is to remind yourself of the good qualities you possess in\norder to give you strength and resilience when confronted with distressing situations. This type\nof statement will remind you that hidden underneath your sometimes overwhelming emotions is a\ncaring, loving person who is capable of handling a distressing situation in a healthier way.\nexample: Self-Affirming Statements\nHere are some examples of self-affirming statements. Check (\uf0fc) the ones you\u2019re willing to\nuse, and then create your own:\n\u201cI might have some faults, but I\u2019m still a good person.\u201d\n\u201cI care about myself and other people.\u201d\n\u201cI accept who I am.\u201d\n\u201cI love myself.\u201d\nAdvanced Distress Tolerance Skills: Improve the Moment 55\n[Page 65]\n\u201cI\u2019m a good person, not a mistake.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m good and nobody\u2019s perfect.\u201d\n\u201cI embrace both my good and bad qualities.\u201d\n\u201cToday I take responsibility for everything I do and say.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m becoming a better person every day.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a sensitive person who experiences the world differently.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a sensitive person with rich emotional experiences.\u201d\n\u201cEach day I do the best I can.\u201d\n\u201cEven though I forget sometimes, I\u2019m still a good person.\u201d\n\u201cEven though bad things happened to me in the past, I\u2019m still a good person.\u201d\n\u201cEven though I\u2019ve made mistakes in the past, I\u2019m still a good person.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here for a reason.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a purpose to my life, even though I might not always see it.\u201d\n\u201cI radically accept myself.\u201d\nOther ideas:\nSome people find it helpful to write their self-affirming statements on index cards and then\npost them throughout their homes. One woman wrote her statement on her bathroom mirror with\nan erasable marker so it was the first thing she saw in the morning. One man wrote his on a sticky\nnote and kept it posted on his computer as he worked. You can choose to remind yourself of your\nself-affirming statement in any way that works. But choose a technique that will remind you many\ntimes throughout the day. The more often you can see the statement, the more it will help change\nthe way you think about yourself.\nCREATE NEW COPING STRATEGIES\nNow that you\u2019re familiar with all the distress tolerance skills, you can create new coping strategies\nfor your future. The easiest way to do this is to examine some of the distressing situations you\u2019ve\nexperienced in the past and to identify how you\u2019ve coped with them. Often, people with overwhelming emotions go through similar distressing situations over and over again. So in some ways\nthese situations are predictable. In this exercise, you\u2019ll identify what those past situations were,\nhow you coped with them, and what the unhealthy consequences were. Then you\u2019ll identify what\n56 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 66]\nnew coping strategies you can use in the future if you experience similar situations and what the\nhealthier consequences might be as a result of using those new strategies.\nBut as you\u2019ll notice, you\u2019ve been given two different New Coping Strategies worksheets. This\nis because you\u2019ll need different coping strategies to use in situations when you\u2019re alone or when\nyou\u2019re with someone else. For example, when you\u2019re alone and feel overwhelmed, it might be most\neffective to use cue-controlled relaxation or mindful breathing techniques to soothe yourself. But\nthese techniques might be awkward or impossible to use when you\u2019re with someone else. So you\u2019ll\nneed to be prepared with other skills for those situations.\nHere\u2019s an example of preparing for both kinds of situations. Carl identified a distressing situation that occurred when he was with someone else. He wrote: \u201cWhen I\u2019m with my brother, he\nalways corrects everything I do.\u201d This is a good situation for Carl to examine because it\u2019s predictable that the next time he\u2019s with his brother, Carl will experience a similar distressing situation.\nNext, Carl identified how he usually coped with that situation with his brother, using his old\ncoping strategies. He wrote: \u201cWe fight. I eat too much. I scratch myself. I think about all the times\nhe\u2019s insulted me in the past.\u201d Then Carl recorded the unhealthy consequences of his actions: \u201cWe\nboth get angry. I gain weight. I get cuts all over my face and arms. I feel horrible for days thinking\nabout the past.\u201d Obviously, none of Carl\u2019s strategies has had any long-term benefits. Next, Carl\nidentified new distress tolerance skills he could use the next time this situation arose with his\nbrother. Under \u201cNew Coping Strategies,\u201d Carl wrote the most appropriate distress tolerance skills\nfor this type of situation. He chose them from the skills he found helpful in the last two chapters.\nHe wrote: \u201cTake a time-out. Use my new coping thought: \u2018I\u2019m strong and I can deal with him.\u2019\nRadically accept myself and the situation in a new way.\u201d Then he predicted what the healthier\npossible consequences of these new strategies would be: \u201cWe won\u2019t fight as much. I won\u2019t eat as\nmuch. I\u2019ll feel stronger. Maybe I can deal with the situation better in the future.\u201d Obviously, the\nconsequences of using his new distress tolerance skills would have been much healthier for Carl.\nBut these coping strategies are probably different from the strategies he might choose when\nhe\u2019s in a distressing situation by himself. So Carl also filled out the worksheet for coping with distressing situations when he\u2019s alone. The situation he selected was: \u201cSometimes I feel scared when\nI\u2019m alone.\u201d Again, this is a good situation for Carl to examine because it\u2019s predictable that he will\nexperience this same overwhelming feeling the next time he\u2019s alone. The old coping strategies that\nCarl used to deal with this situation were: \u201cI smoke pot. I go to the bar and drink. I cut myself. I\nspend money on my credit card.\u201d And the unhealthy consequences of these actions were: \u201cI feel\nsick after smoking or drinking too much. I get into fights at the bar. I bleed. I spend too much\nmoney for things I don\u2019t need.\u201d Next, in order to prepare for the future, Carl chose new coping\nstrategies to deal with this situation: \u201cUse mindful breathing. Remember my connection to the\nuniverse. Use safe-place visualization. Remember what I value.\u201d And finally, the healthier possible\nconsequences that he predicted were: \u201cI won\u2019t feel as anxious. I won\u2019t hurt myself. I\u2019ll have more\nmoney. I\u2019ll feel more relaxed.\u201d Again, it\u2019s easy to see that Carl\u2019s new distress tolerance skills are\nmuch healthier for him than his old coping strategies. The same results can also benefit you if you\ntake the time to prepare for predictable situations in your own future.\nAdvanced Distress Tolerance Skills: Improve the Moment 57\n[Page 67]\n58 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\nGNISSERTSID\nROF\nSEIGETARTS\nGNIPOC\nWEN\nETAERC\neSle\nenoemoS\nHTIw\nER\u2019uOY\nNEHW\nSNOITAuTIS\nelbissoP\nreihtlaeH\ngnipoC\nweN\nyhtlaehnU\nseigetartS\ngnipoC\ndlO\nnoitautiS\ngnissertsiD\nsecneuqesnoC\nseigetartS\nsecneuqesnoC\n.hcum\nsa\nthgif\nt\u2019now\neW\n.tuo-emit\na\nekaT\nI\n.yrgna\nteg\nhtob\neW\noot\ntae\nI .thgif\neW\nm\u2019I\nnehW\n:elpmaxE\nll\u2019I\n.hcum\nsa\ntae\nt\u2019now\nI\ngnipoc\nwen\nym\nesU\nstuc\nteg\nI\n.thgiew\nniag\n.flesym\nhctarcs\nI\n.hcum\neh\n,rehtorb\nym\nhtiw\nI\nebyaM\n.regnorts\nleef\ngnorts\nm\u2019I\u201c\n:thguoht\ndna\necaf\nym\nrevo\nlla\neht\nlla\ntuoba\nkniht\nI\n-yreve\nstcerroc\nsyawla\n-autis\neht\nhtiw\nlaed\nnac\nhtiw\nlaed\nnac\nI\ndna\nelbirroh\nleef\nI\n.smra\nem\ndetlusni\ns\u2019eh\nsemit\n.od\nI\ngniht\n.erutuf\neht\nni\nretteb\nnoit\ntpecca\nyllacidaR\n\u201d.mih\ntuoba\ngnikniht\nsyad\nrof\n.tsap\neht\nni\nni\nnoitautis\ndna\nflesym\n.tsap\neht\n.yaw\nwen\na .1 .2 .3 .4\n[Page 68]\nAdvanced Distress Tolerance Skills: Improve the Moment 59\n[Page 69]\nCREATE NEW COPING STRATEGIES FOR\nDISTRESSING SITuATIONS WHEN YOu\u2019RE ALONE\nDistressing Situation Old Coping Strategies Unhealthy New Coping Healthier Possible\nConsequences Strategies Consequences\nExample: Sometimes I smoke pot.

Good luck.\n[Page 72]\nchapter 3\nBasic Mindfulness Skills\nAn operational working definition of mindfulness is: the awareness that emerges through\npaying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally to the unfolding\nof experience moment by moment.\n\u2014Jon Kabat-Zinn (2003)\nMINDFuLNESS SKILLS: WHAT ARE THEY?\nMindfulness, also known as meditation, is a valuable skill that has been taught for thousands of\nyears in many of the world\u2019s religions, including Christianity (Merton, 1960), Judaism (Pinson,\n2004), Buddhism (Rahula, 1974), and Islam (Inayat Khan, 2000). Beginning in the 1980s, Jon\nKabat-Zinn began using nonreligious mindfulness skills to help hospital patients cope with chronic\npain problems (Kabat-Zinn, 1982; Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth, & Burney, 1985; Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth,\nBurney, & Sellers, 1987). More recently, similar mindfulness techniques were also integrated into\nother forms of psychotherapy (Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2002), including dialectical behavior\ntherapy (Linehan, 1993a). Studies have shown mindfulness skills to be effective at reducing the\nodds of having another major depressive episode (Teasdale et al., 2000); reducing symptoms of\nanxiety (Kabat-Zinn et al., 1992); reducing chronic pain (Kabat-Zinn et al., 1985; Kabat-Zinn et\nal., 1987); decreasing binge eating (Kristeller & Hallett, 1999); increasing tolerance of distressing\n[Page 73]\nsituations; increasing relaxation; and increasing skills to cope with difficult situations (Baer, 2003).\nAs a result of findings like these, mindfulness is considered one of the most important core skills\nin dialectical behavior therapy (Linehan, 1993a).\nSo what exactly is mindfulness? One definition is offered above by mindfulness researcher Jon\nKabat-Zinn. But for the purposes of this book, mindfulness is the ability to be aware of your thoughts,\nemotions, physical sensations, and actions\u2014in the present moment\u2014without judging or criticizing yourself\nor your experience.\nHave you ever heard the expressions \u201cbe in the moment\u201d or \u201cbe here now\u201d? These are both\ndifferent ways of saying: \u201cbe mindful of what\u2019s happening to you.\u201d But this isn\u2019t always an easy\ntask. At any moment in time, you might be thinking, feeling, sensing, and doing many different\nthings. For example, consider what\u2019s happening to you right now. You\u2019re probably sitting somewhere,\nreading these words. But at the same time, you\u2019re also breathing, listening to the sounds around\nyou, noticing what the book feels like, noticing the weight of your body resting in the chair, and\nmaybe you\u2019re even thinking about something else. It\u2019s also possible that you\u2019re aware of your emotional and physical states of being happy, sad, tired, or excited. Maybe you\u2019re even aware of bodily\nsensations, such as your heart beating or the rising and falling of your chest as you breathe. You\nmight even be doing something that you\u2019re completely unaware of, like shaking your leg, humming,\nor resting your head in your hand. That\u2019s a lot to be aware of, and right now, you\u2019re just reading\na book. Imagine what\u2019s happening to you when you\u2019re doing other things in your life, like talking\nwith someone or dealing with people at work. The truth is, no one is 100 percent mindful all the\ntime. But the more mindful you learn to be, the more control you will gain over your life.\nBut remember, time never stands still and each second of your life is different. Because of\nthis, it\u2019s important that you learn to be aware \u201cin each present moment.\u201d For example, by the time\nyou finish reading this sentence, the moment that you started reading it is gone and your present\nmoment is now different. In fact, you are now different. The cells in your body are constantly\ndying and being replaced, so physically you\u2019re different. Equally important, your thoughts, feelings,\nsensations, and actions are never exactly the same in every situation, so they\u2019re different too. For\nthese reasons, it\u2019s important that you learn to be mindful of how your experience changes in each\nindividual moment of your life.\nAnd lastly, in order to be fully aware of your experiences in the present moment, it\u2019s necessary\nthat you do so without criticizing yourself, your situation, or other people. In dialectical behavior\ntherapy this is called radical acceptance (Linehan, 1993a). As described in chapter 2, radical\nacceptance means tolerating something without judging it or trying to change it. This is important\nbecause if you\u2019re judging yourself, your experience, or someone else in the present moment, then\nyou\u2019re not really paying attention to what\u2019s happening in that moment. For example, many people\nspend a lot of time worrying about mistakes they\u2019ve made in the past or worrying about mistakes\nthat they might make in the future. But while they\u2019re doing this, their focus is no longer on what\u2019s\nhappening to them now; their thoughts are somewhere else. As a result, they live in a painful past\nor future, and life feels very difficult.\nSo to review, mindfulness is the ability to be aware of your thoughts, emotions, physical\nsensations, and actions\u2014in the present moment\u2014without judging or criticizing yourself or your\nexperience.\n64 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 74]\nA \u201cMINDLESS\u201d ExERCISE\nObviously, mindfulness is a skill that requires practice. Most people get distracted, \u201czone out,\u201d or\nspend most of their daily lives being unmindful or running on autopilot. As a result, they then\nget lost, anxious, and frustrated when a situation doesn\u2019t happen as they expect it to. Here are\nsome common ways in which all of us have experienced being unmindful. Check (\uf0fc) the ones\nthat you\u2019ve done:\nWhile driving or traveling, you don\u2019t remember the experience or which roads you\ntook.\nWhile having a conversation, you suddenly realize that you don\u2019t know what the other\nperson is talking about.\nWhile having a conversation, you\u2019re already thinking about what you\u2019re going to say\nnext before the other person has even stopped speaking.\nWhile reading, you suddenly realize that you\u2019ve been thinking about something else\nand have no idea what you just read.\nWhile walking into a room, you suddenly forget what you came to get.\nAfter putting something down, you can\u2019t remember where you just put it.\nWhile taking a shower, you\u2019re already planning what you have to do later and then\nyou forget if you\u2019ve already washed your hair or some other body part.\nWhile having sex, you\u2019re thinking about other things or other people.\nAll of these examples are fairly harmless. But for people with overwhelming emotions, being\nunmindful can often have a devastating effect on their lives. Consider the example of Lee. Lee\nthought that everyone at work hated him. One day, a new employee whom Lee found attractive\napproached him in the cafeteria and asked to sit down. The woman tried to be friendly and make\nconversation, but Lee was more engaged in the conversation in his own head than he was in the\none with the woman.\n\u201cShe\u2019s probably just stuck up like the rest of them,\u201d he thought. \u201cWhy would someone like her\nbe interested in me anyway? Why would she want to sit with me? It\u2019s probably just a joke someone\nelse put her up to.\u201d From the moment the woman sat down and tried to talk with him, Lee just\nbecame angrier and more suspicious.\nThe woman did her best to make small talk. She asked Lee how he liked working at the\ncompany, how long he\u2019d been there, and she even asked him about the weather, but Lee never\nnoticed. He was so wrapped up in his own conversation, and in paying attention to his own selfcritical thoughts, that he never even recognized that the woman was trying to be friendly.\nAfter five minutes of unsuccessfully trying, the woman finally stopped talking to Lee. Then a\nfew minutes later, she moved to a different table, and when she did, Lee congratulated himself. \u201cI\nBasic Mindfulness Skills 65\n[Page 75]\nknew it,\u201d he thought, \u201cI knew she wasn\u2019t really interested in me.\u201d But at the expense of being right,\nLee\u2019s unmindfulness and self-criticism had cost him another opportunity to meet a potential friend.\nWHY ARE MINDFuLNESS SKILLS IMPORTANT?\nNow that you have a better idea of what mindfulness is\u2014and isn\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s probably easy to see why\nthis skill is so important. But for the purposes of this workbook, let\u2019s be very clear about why you\nneed to learn mindfulness skills. There are three reasons:\n1 . Mindfulness skills will help you focus on one thing at a time in the present moment, and\nby doing this you can better control and soothe your overwhelming emotions.\n2 . Mindfulness will help you learn to identify and separate judgmental thoughts from your\nexperiences. These judgmental thoughts often fuel your overwhelming emotions.\n3 . Mindfulness will help you develop a skill that\u2019s very important in dialectical behavior\ntherapy called wise mind (Linehan, 1993a).\nWise mind is the ability to make healthy decisions about your life based on both your rational thoughts and your emotions. For example, you\u2019ve probably noticed that it\u2019s often difficult\u2014or\nimpossible\u2014to make good decisions when your emotions are intense, out of control, or contradict\nwhat\u2019s rational. Similarly, it\u2019s often difficult to make informed decisions when your thoughts are\nintense, irrational, or contradict how you feel. Wise mind is a decision-making process that balances the reasoning of your thoughts with the needs of your emotions, and it is a skill that will\nbe discussed further in chapter 4.\nABOuT THIS CHAPTER\nThroughout this chapter and the next, you\u2019ll be presented with exercises to help you become more\nmindful of your moment-to-moment experiences. This chapter will introduce you to beginning\nmindfulness exercises to help you observe and describe your thoughts and emotions more carefully.\nIn dialectical behavior therapy, these are called \u201cwhat\u201d skills (Linehan, 1993b), meaning they\u2019ll\nhelp you become mindful of what you\u2019re focusing on. Then in the next chapter, you\u2019ll be taught\nmore advanced mindfulness skills. In dialectical behavior therapy, these are called \u201chow\u201d skills\n(Linehan, 1993b), meaning they\u2019ll help you learn how to be both mindful and nonjudgmental in\nyour daily experiences.\nThe exercises in this chapter will teach you four \u201cwhat\u201d skills:\n1 . To focus more fully on the present moment\n2 . To recognize and focus on your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations\n66 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 76]\n3 . To focus on your moment-to-moment stream of awareness\n4 . To separate your thoughts from your emotions and physical sensations\nAs you read the following exercises, it\u2019s important that you practice them in the order in\nwhich they\u2019re presented. The exercises in this chapter are grouped according to the four \u201cwhat\u201d\nskills, and each exercise builds on the previous exercise.\nExercise: Focus on a Single Minute\nThis is the first exercise that will help you focus more fully on the present moment. It\u2019s simple to\ndo, but it often has an amazing effect. Its purpose is to help you become more mindful of your\nown sense of time. For this exercise, you\u2019ll need a watch with a second hand or, preferably, a\nstopwatch.\nMany people feel that time goes by very quickly. As a result, they\u2019re always in a rush to do\nthings and they\u2019re always thinking about the next thing they have to do or the next thing that could\ngo wrong. Unfortunately, this just makes them more unmindful of what they\u2019re doing in the present\nmoment. Other people feel that time goes by very slowly. As a result, they feel like they have more\ntime than they actually do and they frequently find themselves running late. This simple exercise\nwill help you become more mindful of how quickly or slowly time actually does go by.\nInstructions\nTo begin this exercise, find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won\u2019t be disturbed for\na few minutes and turn off any distracting sounds. Begin timing yourself with your watch or stopwatch.\nThen, without counting the seconds or looking at the watch, simply sit wherever you are. When you\nthink that one minute has passed, check the watch again, or stop the timer. Note how much time really\nhas passed.\nDid you allow less than a full minute to pass? If so, how long was it\u2014a few seconds, twenty\nseconds, forty seconds? If it wasn\u2019t a full minute, consider how this affects you. Are you always in\na rush to do things because you don\u2019t think you have enough time? If so, what does the result of\nthis exercise mean for you?\nOr did you allow more than a minute to pass? If so, how long was it\u2014one-and-a-half minutes,\ntwo minutes? If so, consider how this affects you. Are you frequently late for appointments because\nyou think that you have more time than you really do? If so, what does the result of this exercise\nmean for you?\nWhatever your results were, one of the purposes of learning mindfulness skills is to help you\ndevelop a more accurate awareness of all your moment-to-moment experiences, including your\nperception of time. If you\u2019d like, return to this exercise in a few weeks after you\u2019ve been practicing\nyour mindfulness skills and see if your perception of time has changed.\nBasic Mindfulness Skills 67\n[Page 77]\nExercise: Focus on a Single Object\nFocusing on a single object is the second mindfulness skill that will help you concentrate more\nfully on the present moment. Remember, one of the biggest traps of being unmindful is that your\nattention wanders from one thing to the next or from one thought to the next. And as a result,\nyou often get lost, distracted, and frustrated. This exercise will help you focus your attention on a\nsingle object. The purpose of this exercise is to help you train your \u201cmental muscle.\u201d This means\nyou will learn to maintain your focus on whatever it is you\u2019re observing. And with practice, you\u2019ll\nget better at focusing your attention, just like an athlete who exercises certain muscles to become\nstronger.\nDuring this exercise, you will eventually become distracted by your thoughts, memories, or\nother sensations. That\u2019s okay; this happens to everyone who does this exercise. Do your best not\nto criticize yourself or stop the exercise. Just notice when your mind wanders and return your focus\nto whatever object you\u2019re observing.\nPick a small object to focus on. Choose something that can rest on a table, is safe to touch,\nand is emotionally neutral. It can be anything, such as a pen, a flower, a watch, a ring, a cup,\nor something similar. Don\u2019t choose to focus on something that could hurt you or on a picture of\nsomeone you don\u2019t like. These will stir up too many emotions for you right now.\nFind a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won\u2019t be disturbed for a few minutes, and\nput the object on a table in front of you. Turn off any distracting sounds. If you have a stopwatch\nor an alarm clock, set the timer for five minutes. Do this exercise once or twice a day for two\nweeks, choosing a different object to focus on each time.\nYou can photocopy the instructions if you want extra copies to refer to, or you can record\nthe instructions in a slow, even voice on an audio-recording device and play them while you\u2019re\nexploring the object.\nInstructions\nTo begin, sit comfortably and take a few slow, deep breaths. Then, without touching the object,\nbegin looking at it and exploring its different surfaces with your eyes. Take your time exploring what it\nlooks like. Then try to imagine the different qualities that the object possesses.\n\u000e What does the surface of the object look like?\n\u000e Is it shiny or dull?\n\u000e Does it look smooth or rough?\n\u000e Does it look soft or hard?\n\u000e Does it have multiple colors or just one color?\n\u000e What else is unique about the way the object looks?\n68 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 78]\nTake your time observing the object. Now hold the object in your hand or reach out and touch the\nobject. Begin noticing the different ways it feels.\n\u000e Is it smooth or is it rough?\n\u000e Does it have ridges or is it flat?\n\u000e Is it soft or is it hard?\n\u000e Is it bendable or is it rigid?\n\u000e Does the object have areas that feel different from each other?\n\u000e What does the temperature of the object feel like?\n\u000e If you can hold it in your hand, notice how much it weighs.\n\u000e What else do you notice about the way it feels?\nContinue exploring the object with both your sight and your sense of touch. Continue to breathe\ncomfortably. When your attention begins to wander, return your focus to the object. Keep on exploring\nthe object until your alarm goes off or until you have fully explored all the qualities of the object.\nExercise: Band of Light\nThis is the third exercise that will help you focus more fully on the present moment. It will help\nyou become more mindful of the physical sensations in your body. Read the instructions before\nbeginning the exercise to familiarize yourself with the process. Then you can either keep these\ninstructions near you if you need to refer to them while you\u2019re doing the exercise, or you can record\nthem in a slow, even voice on an audio-recording device and play them while you\u2019re observing the\nsensations in your body.\nAs with the other exercises in this chapter, most likely your focus will begin to wander while\nyou\u2019re doing this exercise. That\u2019s okay. When you recognize that your focus is drifting, gently return\nyour attention to the exercise and do your best not to criticize or judge yourself.\nInstructions\nTo begin, find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won\u2019t be disturbed for ten minutes.\nTurn off any distracting sounds. Take a few slow, long breaths and then close your eyes. Using your\nimagination, envision a narrow band of white light circling the top of your head like a halo. As this\nexercise progresses, the band of light will slowly move down your body, and as it does, you will become\naware of the different physical sensations you\u2019re feeling beneath the band of light.\nBasic Mindfulness Skills 69\n[Page 79]\nAs you continue to breathe with your eyes closed, continue to see the band of white light encircling\nthe top of your head and notice any physical sensations you feel on that part of your body. Perhaps you\nwill notice your scalp tingling or itching. Whatever sensations you notice are okay.\n\u000e Slowly the band of light begins to descend around your head, passing over the tops of\nyour ears, your eyes, and the top of your nose. As it does, become aware of any sensations you feel there, even small sensations.\n\u000e Notice any muscle tension you may be feeling on the top of your head.\n\u000e As the band of light slowly descends over your nose, mouth, and chin, continue to focus\non any physical sensations you might be feeling there.\n\u000e Pay attention to the back of your head where you may be having sensations.\n\u000e Notice any sensations you may be feeling in your mouth, on your tongue, or on your\nteeth.\n\u000e Continue to watch the band of light in your imagination descend around your neck, and\nnotice any feelings in your throat or any muscle tension on the back of your neck.\n\u000e Now the band widens and begins to move down your torso, across the width of your\nshoulders.\n\u000e Notice any sensations, muscle tension, or tingling you might be feeling in your shoulders,\nupper back, upper arms, and upper chest area.\n\u000e As the band of light continues to descend down around your arms, notice any feelings\nyou\u2019re aware of in your upper arms, elbows, forearms, wrists, hands, and fingers. Become\naware of any tingling, itching, or tension you might be holding in those places.\n\u000e Now become aware of your chest, the middle of your back, the side of your torso, your\nlower back, and stomach. Again, notice any tension or sensations, no matter how small\nthey might be.\n\u000e As the band continues to move down your lower body, become aware of any sensations\nin your pelvic region, buttocks, and upper legs.\n\u000e Be sure to pay attention to the backs of your legs and notice any feelings there.\n\u000e Continue to watch the band of light descend around your lower legs, around your calves,\nshins, feet, and toes. Notice any feelings or tension you\u2019re experiencing.\nThen as the band of light disappears after completing its descent, take a few more slow, long\nbreaths, and when you feel comfortable, slowly open your eyes and return your focus to the room.\n70 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 80]\nExercise: Inner-Outer Experience\nNow that you\u2019ve practiced being mindful of both an object outside of yourself and your internal\nphysical sensations, the next step is to combine the two experiences. This is the first exercise that\nwill teach you how to recognize and focus on your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations.\nThis will be done by teaching you to shift your attention back and forth in a mindful, focused\nway between what you are experiencing internally, such as your physical sensations and thoughts,\nand what you are experiencing externally, such as what you notice using your eyes, ears, nose, and\nsense of touch.\nRead the instructions before beginning the exercise to familiarize yourself with the experience. Then you can either keep these instructions near you if you need to refer to them while\nyou\u2019re doing the exercise, or you can record them in a slow, even voice on an audio-recording\ndevice so that you can listen to them while you practice shifting your focus between your internal\nand external awareness.\nInstructions\nTo begin, find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won\u2019t be disturbed for ten minutes.\nTurn off any distracting sounds. Take a few slow, long breaths and relax.\nNow, keeping your eyes open, focus your attention on an object in the room. Notice what the object\nlooks like. Notice its shape and color. Imagine what that object would feel like if you could hold it. Imagine\nwhat the object must weigh. Describe the object silently to yourself, being as descriptive as possible. Take a\nminute to do this. Keep breathing. If your focus begins to drift, simply return your attention to the exercise\nwithout criticizing yourself. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions.]\nWhen you have finished describing the object, return your focus to your body. Notice any physical sensations that you might be experiencing. Scan your body from your head to your feet. Notice any\nmuscle tension you might be holding, any tingling you might be experiencing, or any other sensations of\nwhich you are aware. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing slow, deep breaths. [Pause here for\none minute if you are recording the instructions.]\nNow redirect your attention to your sense of hearing. Notice any sounds that you can hear. Notice\nsounds you hear coming from outside your room and note to yourself what they are. Now become aware\nof any sounds you hear coming from inside the room and note to yourself what they are. Try to notice\neven small sounds, such as the ticking of a clock, the sound of the wind, or the beating of your heart. If\nyou become distracted by any thoughts, return your focus to your sense of hearing. Take a minute to do\nthis, and keep breathing. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions.]\nWhen you have finished listening to the sounds that you can notice, return your focus to your\nbody. Again, notice any physical sensations. Become aware of the weight of your body resting in the\nchair. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor. Notice the weight of your head resting on top of\nyour neck. Notice in general how your body feels. If you become distracted by your thoughts, just notice\nwhat they are and refocus your attention as best you can on your physical sensations. Take a minute to\nBasic Mindfulness Skills 71\n[Page 81]\ndo this, and keep breathing slow, deep breaths. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording the\ninstructions.]\nOnce again, redirect your attention. This time, put your focus on your sense of smell. Notice any\nsmells that are in the room, pleasant or otherwise. If you don\u2019t notice any smells, just become aware of\nthe flow of air moving into your nostrils as you breathe in through your nose. Try your best to maintain\nyour focus on your sense of smell. If you become distracted by any thoughts, return your focus to your\nnose. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording\nthe instructions.]\nWhen you have finished using your sense of smell, once again return your focus to your physical sensations. Notice any sensations that you might be feeling. Once again, scan your body from your\nhead to your feet and become aware of any muscle tension, tingling, or other physical feelings. If your\nthoughts distract you, do your best to return your focus to your physical sensations. Take a minute to\ndo this, and keep breathing slow, deep breaths. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording the\ninstructions.]\nNow, finally, redirect your attention to your sense of touch. Reach out with one of your hands to\ntouch an object that is within reach. Or, if there is no object within reach, touch the chair you\u2019re sitting on\nor touch your leg. Notice what the object feels like. Notice if it\u2019s smooth or rough. Notice if it\u2019s pliable or\nrigid. Notice if it\u2019s soft or solid. Notice what the sensations feel like on the skin of your fingertips. If your\nthoughts begin to distract you, simply return your focus to the object that you\u2019re touching. Take a minute\nto do this, and keep breathing slow, deep breaths. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording the\ninstructions.]\nWhen you\u2019ve finished, take three to five slow, long breaths and return your focus to the room.\nExercise: Record Three Minutes of Thoughts\nThis is the second exercise that will help you recognize and focus on your thoughts, emotions, and\nphysical sensations. In this exercise, you will identify the number of thoughts you have in a threeminute period. This will allow you to become more mindful of just how quickly your mind really\nworks. This exercise will also help you prepare for the next exercise, Thought Defusion.\nThe instructions for this exercise are simple: set a timer for three minutes and begin writing\ndown every thought you have on a piece of paper. But don\u2019t try to record the thought word for\nword. Just write down a word or two that represents the thought. For example, if you were thinking about a project you have to complete at work by next week, simply write \u201cproject\u201d or \u201cwork\nproject.\u201d Then record your next thought.\nSee how many of your thoughts you can catch in three minutes, no matter how small the\nthoughts are. Even if you start thinking about this exercise, write \u201cexercise.\u201d Or if you start thinking about the paper you\u2019re writing on, write \u201cpaper.\u201d No one else ever has to see this record, so be\nhonest with yourself.\nWhen you\u2019ve finished, count the number of thoughts you had in three minutes and multiply\nthat number by twenty to get an idea of how many thoughts you might have in an hour.\n72 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 82]\nExercise: Thought Defusion\nThis is the third exercise that will help you recognize and focus on your thoughts, emotions, and\nphysical sensations. Thought defusion is a technique borrowed from acceptance and commitment\ntherapy (Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 1999), which has proven to be a very successful treatment for\nemotional distress.\nWhen distressing thoughts keep repeating, it\u2019s often easy to get \u201chooked\u201d on them, like a\nfish biting on a bait hook (Chodron, 2003). In contrast, thought defusion will help you mindfully\nobserve your thoughts without getting stuck on them. With practice, this skill will give you more\nfreedom to choose which thoughts you want to focus on and which thoughts you want to let go\nof instead of getting stuck on all of them.\nThought defusion requires the use of your imagination. The object of this skill is to visualize your thoughts, either as pictures or words, harmlessly floating away from you without obsessing about them or analyzing them. Whichever way you choose to do this is okay. Here are some\nsuggestions that other people have found helpful:\n\u000e Imagine sitting in a field watching your thoughts float away on clouds.\n\u000e Picture yourself sitting near a stream watching your thoughts float past on leaves.\n\u000e See your thoughts written in the sand and then watch the waves wash them\naway.\n\u000e Envision yourself driving a car and see your thoughts pass by on billboards.\n\u000e See your thoughts leave your head and watch them sizzle in the flame of a\ncandle.\n\u000e Imagine sitting beside a tree and watch your thoughts float down on leaves.\n\u000e Picture yourself standing in a room with two doors; then watch your thoughts enter\nthrough one door and leave through the other.\nIf one of these ideas works for you, that\u2019s great. If not, feel free to create your own. Just be\nsure that your idea captures the purpose of this exercise, which is to visually watch your thoughts\ncome and go without holding on to them and without analyzing them. Remember to use the\nconcept of radical acceptance while doing this exercise. Let your thoughts be whatever they are\nand don\u2019t get distracted fighting them or criticizing yourself for having them. Just let the thoughts\ncome and go.\nRead the instructions before beginning the exercise to familiarize yourself with the experience. If you feel more comfortable listening to the instructions, use an audio-recording device to\nrecord the instructions in a slow, even voice so you can listen to them while practicing this technique. When you are first using thought defusion, set a kitchen timer or an alarm clock for three\nto five minutes and practice letting go of your thoughts until the alarm goes off. Then as you get\nmore accustomed to using this technique, you can set the alarm for longer periods of time, like\nBasic Mindfulness Skills 73\n[Page 83]\neight or ten minutes. But don\u2019t expect to be able to sit still that long when you first start. In the\nbeginning, three to five minutes is a long time to use thought defusion.\nInstructions\nTo begin, find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won\u2019t be disturbed for as long as\nyou\u2019ve set your timer. Turn off any distracting sounds. Take a few slow, long breaths, relax, and close\nyour eyes.\nNow, in your imagination, picture yourself in the scenario that you chose, watching your thoughts\ncome and go, whether it\u2019s by the beach, near a stream, in a field, in a room, or wherever. Do your best\nto imagine yourself in that scene. After you do, start to become aware of the thoughts that you\u2019re having.\nStart to observe the thoughts that are coming up, whatever they are. Don\u2019t try to stop your thoughts, and\ndo your best not to criticize yourself for any of the thoughts. Just watch the thoughts arise, and then, using\nwhatever technique you\u2019ve chosen, watch the thoughts disappear. Whatever the thought is, big or small,\nimportant or unimportant, watch the thought arise in your mind and then let it float away or disappear\nby whichever means you\u2019ve chosen.\nJust continue to watch the thoughts arise and disappear. Use pictures to represent the thoughts or\nwords, whatever works best for you. Do your best to watch the thoughts arise and disappear without\ngetting hooked into them and without criticizing yourself.\nIf more than one thought comes up at the same time, see them both arise and disappear. If the\nthoughts come very quickly, do your best to watch them all disappear without getting hooked on any of\nthem. Continue to breathe and watch the thoughts come and go until your timer goes off.\nWhen you\u2019ve finished, take a few more slow, long breaths and then slowly open your eyes and\nreturn your focus to the room.\nExercise: Describe Your Emotion\nThis is the fourth exercise that will help you recognize and focus on your thoughts, emotions, and\nphysical sensations. So far, the exercises in this chapter have helped you learn to be more mindful\nof your physical sensations and thoughts. This next exercise will help you become more mindful of\nyour emotions. As with some of the other exercises, the instructions for this exercise might sound\nsimple, but the results can be powerful. This exercise will ask you to choose an emotion and then\nto describe that emotion by drawing it and exploring it.\nSo, to begin, pick an emotion. It can be either a pleasant or an unpleasant emotion. Ideally,\nyou should choose an emotion that you\u2019re feeling right now, unless that emotion is overwhelmingly\nsad or self-destructive. If it is, you should wait until you feel more in control of your emotions before\nbeginning this exercise. On the other hand, if you can\u2019t identify what you\u2019re feeling now, choose\nan emotion that you were feeling recently, something that you can easily remember. But, whichever\nyou choose, try to be specific about what the emotion is. For example, if you got into a fight with\nyour spouse or partner recently because he or she did something to you, that\u2019s the situation, not the\n74 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 84]\nemotion. Maybe this situation made you feel angry, hurt, sad, stupid, or something else. Be specific\nabout how you feel. Here\u2019s another example. Maybe someone recently gave you a gift. That\u2019s the\nsituation. Your emotion would depend on how you felt about the gift. If it was something you\u2019ve\nalways wanted, you might feel elated. If the gift came from someone you don\u2019t know very well, you\nmight feel anxious about its purpose. Be specific about how you feel.\nTo help you choose an emotion, use this list of some commonly felt emotions.\nlIst of coMMonly felt eMotIons\nAdored Empty Irritated\nAfraid Energetic Jealous\nAngry Enlightened Joyful\nAnnoyed Enlivened Lively\nAnxious Enraged Lonely\nApologetic Enthusiastic Loved\nAshamed Envious Loving\nBlessed Excited Mad\nBlissful Exhausted Nervous\nBored Flirtatious Obsessed\nBothered Foolish Pleased\nBroken Fragile Proud\nBubbly Frightened Regretful\nCautious Frustrated Relieved\nCheerful Glad Respected\nConfident Guilty Restless\nContent Happy Sad\nCurious Hopeful Satisfied\nDelighted Hopeless Scared\nDepressed Horrified Scattered\nDetermined Hurt Secure\nDisappointed Hysterical Shy\nDisgusted Indifferent Smart\nDisturbed Infatuated Sorry\nEmbarrassed Interested Strong\nBasic Mindfulness Skills 75\n[Page 85]\nSurprised Tired Vulnerable\nSuspicious Unsure Worried\nTerrified Upset Worthless\nThrilled Vivacious Worthy\nWhen you finish identifying the emotion you want to explore, write it down at the top of the\nDescribe Your Emotion form (on the next page) or use a blank piece of paper.\nThen, using your imagination, draw a picture of what your emotion might look like. This\nmight sound hard to do, but just do the best you can. For example, if you are feeling happy, maybe\na picture of the sun expresses how you feel or maybe a picture of an ice-cream cone would do\nbetter. The picture doesn\u2019t have to make sense to anyone else but you. Just give it a try.\nNext, try to think of a sound that would further describe the emotion. For example, if you\nare feeling sad, maybe the sound of a groan would describe how you feel, such as \u201cugh.\u201d Or maybe\na certain song expresses your emotion better. Describe the sound as best you can, and write it\nnear your drawing.\nThen describe an action that \u201cfits\u201d your emotion. For example, if you are feeling bored, maybe\nthe action would be to take a nap. Or if you are feeling shy, maybe the action would be to run\naway and hide. Do your best to describe the action, and write it near your drawing.\nThe next step of this exercise is to describe the intensity of the emotion on which you\u2019re\nfocusing. This will require some thought. Do your best to describe the strength of this emotion.\nFeel free to be creative and use metaphors if you need to. For example, if you are feeling very\nnervous, you might write that the feeling is so strong that your \u201cheart feels like a drum at a rock\nconcert.\u201d Or if you are only feeling a little angry, you might write that the intensity is like a \u201cmosquito bite.\u201d\nAfter describing the intensity of the emotion, briefly describe the overall quality of what the\nemotion feels like. Again, feel free to be as creative as you need to be in your description. If you are\nnervous, maybe it makes you feel like your \u201cknees are made of jelly.\u201d Or if you are getting angry, it\nmight make you feel like \u201cwater that\u2019s about to boil.\u201d Be as accurate as you can in your description\nand be as creative as you need to be in order to convey your feelings.\nFinally, add any thoughts that arise due to your emotion. But be clear that what you describe\nis a thought and not another emotion. For example, don\u2019t choose any of the words in the list above\nto describe your thoughts. Those are emotions, not thoughts. Your thoughts should be able to finish\nthe following sentences: \u201cMy emotion makes me think that\u2026\u201d or \u201cMy emotion makes me think\nabout\u2026\u201d It\u2019s important that you begin separating your thoughts and your emotions because this\nwill give you better control over both of them in the future. Here are some examples of thoughts\nthat can arise from emotions. If you are feeling confident, a related thought might be that you\nthink you can ask your boss for a raise, or it makes you remember other times in your life when\nyou felt confident and were successful. Or if you are feeling fragile, a related thought could be that\nyou think you can\u2019t handle any more stress in your life, or it makes you think about how you\u2019re\ngoing to struggle with future problems if you don\u2019t get stronger.\n76 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 86]\nDESCRIBE YOuR EMOTION\nName the emotion:\nDraw a picture of your emotion\nDescribe a related action:\nDescribe a related sound:\nDescribe the intensity of the emotion:\nDescribe the quality of the emotion:\nDescribe thoughts related to the emotion:\nBasic Mindfulness Skills 77\n[Page 87]\nExercise: Focus Shifting\nThis next exercise will teach you the third \u201cwhat\u201d skill, which is learning to identify what you\nare focusing on in your moment-to-moment stream of awareness. Now that you\u2019ve practiced being\nmindful of both your emotions and your sense experiences (seeing, hearing, touching), it\u2019s time\nto put the two experiences together. This exercise is similar to the Inner-Outer Experience exercise because it will also help you shift your attention back and forth in a mindful, focused way.\nHowever, this Focus Shifting exercise will address the shift between your emotions and your senses\nand help you differentiate between the two.\nAt some point in our lives, we all get caught in our emotions. For example, when someone\nsays something insulting to you, maybe you feel upset all day, think poorly of yourself, get angry\nat someone else, or look at the world in a much gloomier way. This \u201cemotional trap\u201d is a common\nexperience for everyone. But for someone struggling with overwhelming emotions, these experiences happen more frequently and intensely. Mindfulness skills will help you separate your presentmoment experience from what\u2019s happening inside you emotionally, thereby giving you a choice as\nto which one you\u2019ll focus on.\nBefore starting this exercise, you\u2019ll also need to identify how you are currently feeling. If you\nneed to refer to the list of emotions in the previous exercise, go ahead. Do your best to be as accurate as possible about how you feel. Even if you think that you\u2019re not feeling anything, you probably\nare. A person is never completely without emotion. Maybe you\u2019re just feeling bored or content. Do\nyour best to identify what it is.\nRead the instructions before beginning this exercise to familiarize yourself with the experience. Then you can either keep these instructions near you if you need to refer to them while\nyou\u2019re doing the exercise, or you can record them in a slow, even voice on an audio-recording\ndevice so that you can listen to them while you practice shifting your focus between your emotions\nand your senses.\nIf you need to, set a timer for five to ten minutes for this exercise.\nInstructions\nTo begin, find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won\u2019t be disturbed for ten minutes.\nTurn off any distracting sounds. Take a few slow, long breaths, and relax.\nNow close your eyes and focus your attention on how you are feeling. Name the emotion silently\nto yourself. Use your imagination to envision what your emotion might look like if it had a shape. The\nimage doesn\u2019t have to make sense to anyone but you. Just allow your imagination to give your emotion a\nform or shape. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing slow breaths. [Pause here for one minute\nif you are recording the instructions.]\nNow open your eyes and put your focus on an object in the room where you\u2019re sitting. Notice what\nthe object looks like. Notice its shape and color. Imagine what that object might feel like if you could\n78 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 88]\nhold it. Imagine what the object must weigh. Describe the object silently to yourself, being as descriptive\nas possible. Take a minute to do this. Keep breathing. If your focus begins to drift, simply return your\nattention to the exercise without criticizing yourself. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording\nthe instructions.]\nWhen you\u2019ve finished describing the object, close your eyes and return your focus to your emotion.\nThink of a sound that might be related to your emotion. The sound can be anything that you think\ndescribes your emotion. It can be a noise, a song, or whatever. When you\u2019re done describing the sound\nto yourself, think of an action related to your emotion. Again, it can be anything that further enhances\nyour understanding of your emotion. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing slow, deep breaths.\n[Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions.]\nNow, keeping your eyes closed, redirect your attention to your sense of hearing. Notice any sounds\nthat you can hear. Notice sounds you hear coming from outside your room and note to yourself what\nthey are. Now become aware of any sounds you hear coming from inside the room and note to yourself\nwhat they are. Try to notice even small sounds, such as the ticking of a clock, the sound of the wind, or\nthe beating of your heart. If you become distracted by any thoughts, return your focus to your sense of\nhearing. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording\nthe instructions.]\nWhen you have finished listening to the sounds that you can notice, return your focus to your\nemotion. Keeping your eyes closed, silently describe the intensity and quality of your emotion to yourself.\nAgain, feel free to be creative and use comparisons if you need to. Take a minute to do this, and keep\nbreathing slow, deep breaths. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions.]\nOnce again, redirect your attention. This time, put your focus on your sense of smell. Notice any\nsmells that are in the room, pleasant or otherwise. If you don\u2019t notice any smells, just become aware of\nthe flow of air moving into your nostrils as you breathe in through your nose. Try your best to maintain\nyour focus on your sense of smell. If you become distracted by any thoughts, return your focus to your\nnose. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording\nthe instructions.]\nWhen you have finished using your sense of smell, once again return your focus to your emotions.\nNotice any thoughts you might be having that are related to your emotion. Be as specific about the thought\nas you can, and make sure your thought isn\u2019t really another emotion. Take a minute to do this, and keep\nbreathing slow, deep breaths. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions.]\nNow, finally, redirect your attention to your sense of touch. Reach out with one of your hands to\ntouch an object that is within reach. Or if there is no object within reach, touch the chair you\u2019re sitting in\nor touch your leg. Notice what the object feels like. Notice if it\u2019s smooth or rough. Notice if it\u2019s pliable or\nrigid. Notice if it\u2019s soft or solid. Notice what the sensations feel like on the skin of your fingertips. If your\nthoughts begin to distract you, simply return your focus to the object that you\u2019re touching. Take a minute\nto do this, and keep breathing slow, deep breaths. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording the\ninstructions.]\nWhen you\u2019ve finished, take three to five slow, long breaths and return your focus to the room.\nBasic Mindfulness Skills 79\n[Page 89]\nExercise: Mindful Breathing\nThis Mindful Breathing exercise will help you learn the fourth \u201cwhat\u201d skill, which is learning to\nseparate your thoughts from your emotions and physical sensations. (You already learned the basics\nof mindful breathing in chapter 2, Advanced Distress Tolerance Skills, but this exercise will give\nyou an additional understanding of the skill.) Very often, when you\u2019re distracted by your thoughts\nand other stimuli, one of the easiest and most effective things you can do is to focus your attention on the rising and falling of your breath. This type of breathing also causes you to take fuller,\ndeeper breaths, which can help you relax.\nIn order to breathe mindfully, you need to focus on three parts of the experience. First, you\nmust count your breaths. This will help you focus your attention, and it will also help you calm your\nmind when you\u2019re distracted by thoughts. Second, you need to focus on the physical experience\nof breathing. This is accomplished by observing the rising and falling of your chest and stomach\nas you inhale and exhale. And third, you need to be aware of any distracting thoughts that arise\nwhile you\u2019re breathing. Then you need to let the thoughts go without getting stuck on them, as in\nthe previous Thought Defusion exercise. Letting go of the distracting thoughts will allow you to\nrefocus your attention on your breathing and help you further calm yourself.\nRead the instructions before beginning the exercise to familiarize yourself with the experience. If you feel more comfortable listening to the instructions, use an audio-recording device to\nrecord the directions in a slow, even voice so that you can listen to them while practicing this technique. When you first start this technique, set a timer or an alarm clock for three to five minutes,\nand practice breathing until the alarm goes off. Then as you get more accustomed to using this\ntechnique to help you relax, you can set the alarm for longer periods of time, like ten or fifteen\nminutes. But don\u2019t expect to be able to sit still that long when you first start. In the beginning,\nthree to five minutes is a long time to focus and breathe. Later, when you become more accustomed\nto using this style of breathing, you can also begin using it while you\u2019re doing other daily activities,\nlike walking, doing the dishes, watching television, or having a conversation.\nWhen using mindful breathing, many people feel as if they become \u201cone\u201d with their breathing, meaning that they feel a deep connection to the experience. If that happens for you, that\u2019s\ngreat. If not, that\u2019s okay, too. Just keep practicing. Also, some people feel light-headed when they\nfirst begin practicing this technique. This may be caused by breathing too fast, too deeply, or\ntoo slowly. Don\u2019t be alarmed. If you begin to feel light-headed, stop if you need to, or return your\nbreathing to a normal rate and begin counting your breaths.\nThis is such a simple and powerful skill that, ideally, you should practice it every day.\nInstructions\nTo begin, find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won\u2019t be disturbed for as long as\nyou\u2019ve set your timer. Turn off any distracting sounds. If you feel comfortable closing your eyes, do so to\nhelp you relax.\n80 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 90]\nTo begin, take a few slow, long breaths, and relax. Place one hand on your stomach. Now slowly\nbreathe in through your nose and then slowly exhale through your mouth. Feel your stomach rise and\nfall as you breathe. Imagine your belly filling up with air like a balloon as you breathe in, and then feel\nit deflate as you breathe out. Feel the breath moving in across your nostrils, and then feel your breath\nblowing out across your lips. As you breathe, notice the sensations in your body. Feel your lungs fill up\nwith air. Notice the weight of your body resting on whatever you\u2019re sitting on. With each breath, notice\nhow your body feels more and more relaxed.\nNow, as you continue to breathe, begin counting your breaths each time you exhale. You can count\neither silently to yourself or aloud. Count each exhalation until you reach \u201c4\u201d and then begin counting\nat \u201c1\u201d again. To begin, breathe in slowly through your nose, and then exhale slowly through your mouth.\nCount \u201c1.\u201d Again, breathe in slowly through your nose and slowly out through your mouth. Count \u201c2.\u201d\nRepeat, breathing in slowly through your nose, and then slowly exhale. Count \u201c3.\u201d Last time\u2014breathe in\nthrough your nose and out through your mouth. Count \u201c4.\u201d Now begin counting at \u201c1\u201d again.\nThis time, though, as you continue to count, occasionally shift your focus to how you\u2019re breathing.\nNotice the rising and falling of your chest and stomach as you inhale and exhale. Again, feel the breath\nmoving in through your nose and slowly out through your mouth. If you want to, place one hand on your\nstomach and feel your breath rise and fall. Continue counting as you take slow, long breaths. Feel your\nstomach expand like a balloon as you breathe in, and then feel it deflate as you breathe out. Continue\nto shift your focus back and forth between counting and the physical experience of breathing.\nNow, lastly, begin to notice any thoughts or other distractions that remove your focus from your\nbreathing. These distractions might be memories, sounds, physical sensations, or emotions. When your\nmind begins to wander and you catch yourself thinking of something else, return your focus to counting\nyour breath. Or return your focus to the physical sensation of breathing. Try not to criticize yourself for\ngetting distracted. Just keep taking slow, long breaths into your belly, in and out. Imagine filling up your\nbelly with air like a balloon. Feel it rising with each inhalation and falling with each exhalation. Keep\ncounting each breath, and with each exhalation, feel your body relaxing, more and more deeply.\nKeep breathing until your alarm goes off. Continue counting your breaths, noticing the physical\nsensation of your breathing and letting go of any distracting thoughts or other stimuli. Then, when your\nalarm goes off, slowly open your eyes and return your focus to the room.\nExercise: Mindful Awareness of Emotions\nThis is the second exercise that will help you learn to separate your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations. Mindful awareness of your emotions starts with focusing on your breathing\u2014just\nnoticing the air moving in through your nose and out through your mouth, filling and emptying\nyour lungs. Then, after four or five slow, long breaths, shift your attention to how you feel emotionally in the present moment. Start by simply noticing if you feel good or bad. Is your basic internal\nsense that you are happy or not happy?\nThen see if you can observe your emotion more closely. What word best describes the feeling?\nConsult the list of emotions from the Describe Your Emotion exercise if you\u2019re having trouble\nfinding the most accurate description. Keep watching the feeling, and while you do, continue\nBasic Mindfulness Skills 81\n[Page 91]\ndescribing to yourself what you observe. Notice the nuances of the feeling or perhaps the threads of\nother emotions woven into it. For example, sometimes sadness has veins of anxiety or even anger.\nSometimes shame is intertwined with loss or resentment. Also notice the strength of your emotion\nand check to see how it changes while you watch it.\nEmotions invariably come as a wave. They escalate, then they reach a crest, and finally they\ndiminish. You can observe this, describing to yourself each point in the wave as the feeling grows\nand passes.\nIf you have difficulty finding an emotion that you\u2019re feeling in the present moment, you can\nstill do this exercise by locating a feeling that you had in the recent past. Think back to a situation during the last several weeks when you had a strong emotion. Visualize the event\u2014where you\nwere, what was happening, what you said, how you felt. Keep recalling details of the scene until\nthe emotion you had then is being felt again by you right now.\nHowever you choose to observe an emotion, once the emotion is clearly recognized, stay\nwith it. Keep describing to yourself the changes in quality, intensity, or type of emotion you are\nfeeling.\nIdeally, you should observe the feeling until it has significantly changed\u2014in quality or\nstrength\u2014and you have some sense of the wave effect of your emotion. While watching your\nfeeling, you\u2019ll also notice thoughts, sensations, and other distractions that try to pull your attention away. This is normal. Just do your best to bring your focus back to your emotion whenever\nyour attention wanders. Just stay with it until you\u2019ve watched long enough to observe your emotion\ngrow, change, and diminish.\nAs you learn to mindfully observe a feeling, two important realizations can emerge. One is\nthe awareness that all feelings have a natural life span. If you keep watching your emotions, they\nwill peak and gradually subside. The second awareness is that the mere act of describing your feelings can give you a degree of control over them. Describing your emotions often has the effect of\nbuilding a container around them, which keeps them from overwhelming you.\nRead the instructions before beginning the exercise to familiarize yourself with the experience. If you feel more comfortable listening to the instructions, use an audio-recording device to\nrecord the directions in a slow, even voice so that you can listen to them while practicing this\ntechnique. If you record the directions, pause between each paragraph so you can leave time to\nfully experience the process.\nInstructions\nTake a long, slow breath and notice the feeling of the air moving in through your nose, going down\nthe back of your throat, and into your lungs. Take another breath and watch what happens in your body\nas you inhale and let go. Keep breathing and watching. Keep noticing the sensations in your body as you\nbreathe. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions.]\nNow turn your attention to what you feel emotionally. Look inside and find the emotion you are\nexperiencing right now. Or find an emotion that you felt recently. Notice whether the emotion is a good\n82 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 92]\nor a bad feeling. Notice whether it is pleasant or unpleasant. Just keep your attention on the feeling until\nyou have a sense of it. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions.]\nNow look for words to describe the emotion. For example, is it elation, contentment, or excitement?\nOr is it sadness, anxiety, shame, or loss? Whatever it is, keep watching and describing the emotion in\nyour mind. Notice any change in the feeling and describe what\u2019s different. If any distractions or thoughts\ncome to mind, do your best to let them go without getting stuck on them. Notice if your feeling is intensifying or diminishing, and describe what that\u2019s like. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording\nthe instructions.]\nKeep observing your emotion and letting go of distractions. Keep looking for words to describe the\nslightest change in the quality or intensity of your feeling. If other emotions begin to weave in, continue to\ndescribe them. If your emotion changes into an altogether new emotion, just keep observing it and finding\nthe words to describe it. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions.]\nThoughts, physical sensations, and other distractions will try to grab your attention. Notice them,\nlet them go, and return your focus to your emotion. Stay with it. Continue observing it. Keep going until\nyou\u2019ve observed your emotion change or diminish.\nCONCLuSION\nYou\u2019ve now learned some basic mindfulness skills. Hopefully, you have a better understanding\nof how your mind works and why these skills are important to learn. You should continue using\nthem on a daily basis. In the next chapter, you will build on these skills and learn more advanced\nmindfulness skills.\nBasic Mindfulness Skills 83\n[Page 93] [Page 94]\nchapter 4\nAdvanced Mindfulness Skills\nIn the previous chapter, you learned what mindfulness is and you also learned the basic \u201cwhat\u201d\nskills of dialectical behavior therapy. This means that you learned to become more mindful of what\nyou are focusing on by using these methods:\n\u000e Focusing more fully on the present moment\n\u000e Recognizing and focusing on your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations\n\u000e Focusing on your moment-to-moment stream of awareness\n\u000e Separating your thoughts from your emotions and physical sensations\nWHAT YOu\u2019LL LEARN IN THIS CHAPTER\nNow, in this chapter, you\u2019ll be introduced to the more advanced \u201chow\u201d skills of mindfulness\n(Linehan, 1993a). These skills will help you learn how to be both mindful and nonjudgmental in\nyour daily experiences. In this chapter, you will learn five \u201chow\u201d skills:\n1 . How to use wise mind\n2 . How to use radical acceptance to acknowledge your daily experiences without judging\nthem\n3 . How to do what\u2019s effective\n4 . How to create a mindfulness regimen for yourself in order to live your life in a more\naware, focused way\n5 . How to overcome the hindrances of your mindfulness practice\n[Page 95]\nAs in the last chapter, it is important that you do the exercises in this chapter in the order\nthat they\u2019re presented. Each of these exercises builds on the one before it.\nWISE MIND\nAs stated in the last chapter, wise mind is the ability to make healthy decisions about your life\nbased on both your rational thoughts and your emotions. This sounds easy to do, but let\u2019s consider\nthe traps that many people often fall into.\nFor example, Leo was a successful salesman with a new company. He had a happy family\nand a fairly good future ahead of himself. However, Leo frequently became upset when he couldn\u2019t\nclose a deal, and so he often felt depressed and thought of himself as a person who would never\nbe able to fully succeed in his life. Despite the positive feedback he received from his supervisors,\nLeo couldn\u2019t shake the feelings of failure that came from deals he couldn\u2019t close. As a result, a few\nmonths after starting his job, Leo quit, just like he had quit similar jobs in the past. He went on\nto take a new job, but similar feelings of failure followed him wherever he went, and he never felt\nfully satisfied with himself.\nSimilarly, Takeesha was a popular college professor who always received high ratings from her\nstudents and other faculty members. But after a few unsuccessful personal relationships, Takeesha\nfelt very lonely. She eventually stopped trying to meet new people because she anticipated that\nthose relationships would just end in failure too. As a result, she felt unworthy of anyone\u2019s love and\nresigned herself to spend the rest of her life living alone.\nUnfortunately, both Leo and Takeesha were overcome by what dialectical behavior therapy\ncalls emotion mind (Linehan, 1993a). Emotion mind occurs when you make judgments or decisions\nbased solely on how you feel. But keep in mind that emotions themselves are not bad or problematic. We all need emotions to live healthy lives. (You\u2019ll learn more about the role of emotions in\nchapters 6 and 7.) The problems associated with emotion mind develop when your emotions control\nyour life. This trap is especially dangerous for people with overwhelming emotions because emotion\nmind distorts your thoughts and judgments and then these distortions make it hard to formulate\nhealthy decisions about your life. Consider what happened to Leo and Takeesha: despite their\nsuccesses, their emotions overwhelmed their lives and led them to make unhealthy decisions.\nThe balancing counterpart to emotion mind is reasonable mind (Linehan, 1993a). Reasonable\nmind is the part of your decision-making process that analyses the facts of a situation, thinks clearly\nabout what is happening, considers the details, and then makes rational decisions. Obviously, rational thinking helps us solve problems and make decisions every day. But again, as with emotions,\ntoo much rational thinking can also be a problem. We all know the story of the very intelligent\nperson who didn\u2019t know how to express his or her emotions and, as a result, lived a very lonely\nlife. So here too a balance is needed in order to live a fulfilling, healthy life. But for people with\noverwhelming emotions, balancing feelings and rational thought is often hard to do.\n86 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 96]\nThe solution is to use wise mind to make healthy decisions about your life. Wise mind results\nfrom using both emotion mind and reasonable mind together (Linehan, 1993a). Wise mind is a\nbalance between feelings and rational thoughts. Again, let\u2019s consider the examples of Leo and\nTakeesha. Both of them were being controlled by their emotion minds. If Leo had been making\ndecisions with wise mind, before quitting his job he would have balanced his decision with reasonable mind. He should have reminded himself of the facts of the situation: he was already a successful salesman, and he only became upset when he couldn\u2019t close a deal. Therefore, was it reasonable\nthat he should quit? Definitely not. What about Takeesha? She received great feedback from both\nher students and fellow faculty members. So was it reasonable to stop meeting new people after a\nfew failed relationships? Definitely not. This is why using wise mind is so important.\nYou can develop wise mind by using the mindfulness skills you have already been practicing in chapter 3. Remember that part of what these exercises did was to help you recognize and\nseparate your thoughts from your emotions. So you\u2019ve already been using both your emotion mind\nand reasonable mind. And by practicing those mindfulness skills even more, it will become easier\nto make healthy decisions based on a balance of what your emotions and your rational thoughts\ntell you.\nWISE MIND AND INTuITION\nAccording to dialectical behavior therapy, wise mind is similar to intuition (Linehan, 1993b).\nOften, both intuition and wise mind are described as \u201cfeelings\u201d that come from \u201cthe gut\u201d or the\nstomach area. The exercise that follows will help you get more in touch with your gut feelings,\nboth physically and mentally. This exercise will help you locate the center of wise mind in your\nbody. This is the spot from which many people report making sensible, wise-mind decisions about\ntheir lives.\nInterestingly, this phenomenon of gut feelings might be supported by scientific evidence.\nResearchers have discovered that a vast web of nerves covers the area of the stomach. This web of\nnerves is second in complexity only to the human brain, so some researchers have referred to this\narea as the enteric brain, meaning the brain in the stomach.\nExercise: Wise-Mind Meditation\nWhen you begin using this technique, set a kitchen timer or an alarm clock for three to five\nminutes and practice this exercise until the alarm goes off. Then, as you get more accustomed to\nusing this technique, you can set the alarm for longer periods of time, like ten or fifteen minutes. If\nyou feel more comfortable listening to the instructions, use an audio-recording device to record the\ndirections in a slow, even voice so that you can listen to them while practicing this technique.\nAdvanced Mindfulness Skills 87\n[Page 97]\nInstructions\nTo begin, find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won\u2019t be disturbed for as long as\nyou\u2019ve set your timer. Turn off any distracting sounds. If you feel comfortable closing your eyes, do so to\nhelp you relax.\nNow locate the bottom of your sternum on your rib cage. You can do this by touching the bone\nat the center of your chest and then following it down toward your abdomen until the bone ends. Now\nplace one hand on your abdomen between the bottom of your sternum and your belly button. This is\nthe center of wise mind.\nTake a few slow, long breaths and relax. Now slowly breathe in through your nose and then slowly\nexhale through your mouth. Feel your abdomen rise and fall as you breathe. Imagine your belly filling\nup with air like a balloon as you breathe in, and then feel it deflate as you breathe out. Feel the breath\nmoving in across your nostrils and then feel your breath blowing out across your lips. As you breathe,\nnotice any sensations in your body. Feel your lungs fill up with air. Notice the weight of your body as it\nrests on the seat in which you\u2019re sitting. With each breath, notice how your body feels, and allow your\nbody to become more and more relaxed.\nNow, as you continue to breathe, let your attention focus on the spot underneath your hand. Let\nyour attention focus on the center of wise mind. Continue to take slow, long breaths. If you have any\ndistracting thoughts, just allow those thoughts to leave you without fighting them and without getting\nstuck on them. Continue to breathe and focus on the center of wise mind. Feel your hand resting on\nyour stomach.\nAs you focus your attention on your center of wise mind, notice what appears. If you\u2019ve had any\ntroubling thoughts, problems, or decisions that you have to make in your life, think about them for a few\nseconds. Then ask your center of wise mind what you should do about these problems or decisions. Ask\nyour inner intuitive self for guidance, and then notice what thoughts or solutions arise out of your center\nof wise mind. Don\u2019t judge whatever answers you receive. Just note them to yourself and keep breathing.\nContinue to focus your attention on your center of wise mind. If no thoughts or answers come to your\nquestions, just continue breathing.\nNow continue to notice your breath rising and falling. Keep breathing and returning your focus to\nthe center of wise mind until the timer goes off. Then when you\u2019ve finished, slowly open your eyes and\nreturn your focus to the room.\nHOW TO MAKE WISE-MIND DECISIONS\nNow that you\u2019ve had practice locating your wise-mind center, you can \u201ccheck in\u201d with that area\nof your body before you make decisions. This can help you determine if a decision is a good one.\nTo do this, simply think about the action you are about to take and focus your attention on your\ncenter of wise mind. Then consider what your wise mind tells you. Does your decision feel like a\ngood one? If so, then maybe you should do it. If it doesn\u2019t feel like a good decision, then maybe\nyou should consider some other options.\n88 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 98]\nLearning to make reliably good decisions about your life is a process that evolves as long as\nyou are alive, and there is no single way to do this. Checking in with your center of wise mind is\nsimply one way that often works for some people. However, some words of caution are needed here.\nWhen you first use wise mind to make decisions about your life, it will probably be difficult to\ntell the difference between an intuitive gut feeling and a decision made the old way with emotion\nmind. The difference can be determined in three ways:\n1 . When you made your decision were you being mindful of both your emotions and the facts\nof the situation? In other words, did you make the decision based on both emotion mind\nand reasonable mind? If you haven\u2019t considered the facts of the situation and are being\ncontrolled by your emotions, you\u2019re not using wise mind. Sometimes we need to let our\nemotions settle and \u201ccool off\u201d before we can make a good decision. If you\u2019ve recently\nbeen involved in a very emotional situation, either good or bad, give yourself enough\ntime for your hot emotions to cool down so that you can use reasonable mind.\n2 . Did the decision \u201cfeel\u201d right to you? Before you make a decision, check in with your center\nof wise mind and notice how it feels. If you check in with your center of wise mind and\nyou feel nervous, maybe the decision you\u2019re about to make isn\u2019t a good one or a safe\none. However, maybe you feel nervous because you\u2019re excited about doing something\nnew, which can be a good thing. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell the difference, and that\u2019s\nwhy using reasonable mind to make your decision is also important. Later, when you\nhave more experience making healthy decisions for your life, it will be easier to tell the\ndifference between a good nervous feeling and a bad nervous feeling.\n3 . You can sometimes tell if you\u2019ve used wise mind by examining the results of your decision. If\nyour decision leads to beneficial results for your life, chances are you used wise mind to\nmake that decision. When you start using wise mind, keep track of your decisions and\nthe results in order to determine if you\u2019re really using wise mind. Remember, wise mind\nshould help you make healthy decisions about your life.\nRADICAL ACCEPTANCE\nAnother very important part of wise mind, and mindfulness in general, is a skill called radical\nacceptance (Linehan, 1993a). (You already explored radical acceptance in chapter 2, Advanced\nDistress Tolerance Skills, but the following description will help you understand how it relates to\nmindfulness skills.) Radical acceptance means tolerating something without judging it or trying to\nchange it. Remember the definition of mindfulness that we gave you in the last chapter? Mindfulness\nis the ability to be aware of your thoughts, emotions, physical sensations, and actions\u2014in the\npresent moment\u2014without judging or criticizing yourself or your experience. Radical acceptance is\na very important piece of being mindful because if you\u2019re judging yourself, your experience, or\nsomeone else in the present moment, then you\u2019re not really paying attention to what\u2019s happening\nAdvanced Mindfulness Skills 89\n[Page 99]\nin that moment. In many ways, judgment is the royal road to suffering, because when you judge\nothers you get angry and when you judge yourself you get depressed. So in order to be truly mindful\nin the present moment, and in order to be fully centered in wise mind, you must practice being\nnonjudgmental.\nRadical acceptance might sound like a difficult skill to master, but it\u2019s definitely worth the\neffort. Consider this example. Thomas struggled with a problem that\u2019s very common for people\nwith overwhelming emotions. He divided everyone and everything into two categories: they were\neither all good or all bad. There was no in-between for him. When people treated him nicely,\nthey were good, but when someone disagreed with him, he considered them to be bad, even if the\nperson had just been on his good side a few minutes before. This quick fluctuation between good\nand bad led Thomas to make a lot of judgments and critical remarks about himself and others.\nOver the years, the accumulation of fluctuations and judgments made Thomas very sensitive to\nsituations that could go wrong. He always expected that other people would make mistakes, insult\nhim, or betray him in some way. One time his sister said that she couldn\u2019t help him take his car\nto the repair shop, and Thomas blew up at her. He criticized her for being ungrateful and selfish.\nHowever, the truth was that she had to take her own daughter to the doctor, but Thomas never\nheard her reasoning. He was too wrapped up in his own judgmental thinking to really listen to\nanyone else. In truth, Thomas had created a pattern in his life where all of his judgments and\ncritical thinking became realities, and this led to a very lonely and distressing life.\nWhen Thomas was finally introduced to the skill of radical acceptance, he was critical of it\ntoo. \u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d he thought, \u201cThis stupid idea isn\u2019t going to help me. I don\u2019t need this. How\ncan anyone not be critical?\u201d But with the urging of his family, Thomas decided to try using radical\nacceptance. At first, it was very difficult for him to not make judgments about himself and other\npeople, but he continued using the exercises in this workbook, and, with practice, radical acceptance became easier. Slowly his thinking began to change. Thomas spent less time obsessing over\njudgmental thoughts and critical remarks, and he spent less time anticipating that other people\nwould insult or betray him. He also no longer thought of people as either just good or bad. He\nbegan to recognize that everyone makes mistakes, and that\u2019s okay. He also became more mindful\nof his thoughts, feelings, sensations, and actions in the present moment, which helped him focus\nbetter on his daily experiences and make healthier choices for his life.\nAs you can see from this example, one of the hardest parts of using radical acceptance is\nrecognizing when you\u2019re being judgmental of yourself or others. This takes practice, and the skills\nin the workbook will help. But recognizing when you\u2019re being judgmental also takes time. You\u2019re\ngoing to make mistakes. When you\u2019re first learning to be nonjudgmental, there will be times when\nyou will be judgmental. Then you\u2019ll recognize what you\u2019re doing, and you\u2019ll be further critical of\nyourself for being judgmental. But that\u2019s okay too. That\u2019s part of the learning process. Learning\nhow to use radical acceptance is a lot like the story of a man who\u2019s walking down a city street and\nfalls through an open manhole to the sewer. He climbs out, looks in the hole, and says, \u201cI better\nnot do that again.\u201d But the next day, walking down the same street, he steps into the same open\nmanhole, climbs out, and says, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I did it again.\u201d Then on the third day, he\u2019s about\nto step into the same open manhole when he suddenly remembers what happened on the two\nprevious days, so he avoids the fall. On the fourth day, the man remembers to walk around the\n90 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 100]\nopen manhole as soon as he starts walking down that street. And on the fifth day, he chooses to\nwalk down a different street in order to avoid the problem completely. Obviously, learning how to\nuse radical acceptance will take you longer than five days, but the process of falling into the same\njudgmental traps will happen in a very similar way.\nBelow are several exercises to help you develop a nonjudgmental attitude and to use the skill\nof radical acceptance. But before you start, let\u2019s clarify radical acceptance a little more, because it\ncan often be a confusing concept for many people. To use radical acceptance does not mean that\nyou silently put up with potentially harmful or dangerous situations in your life. For example, if you\nare in a violent or abusive relationship and you need to get out, then get out. Don\u2019t put yourself\nin harm\u2019s way and simply tolerate whatever happens to you. Radical acceptance is a skill that is\nsupposed to help you live a healthier life; it is not a tool to fill your life with more suffering.\nHowever, there\u2019s no doubt that it will be tough to start using radical acceptance because it\nwill require you to think about yourself, your life, and other people in a new way. But once you start\nusing radical acceptance, you\u2019ll find that it actually gives you more freedom. You\u2019ll no longer spend\nas much time judging yourself and others, and so you\u2019ll be free to do many other things instead.\nRadical acceptance is one of the most important tools to learn in dialectical behavior therapy, and\nit\u2019s definitely worth the effort.\nExercise: Negative Judgments\nThe first step to changing a problem is to recognize when that problem occurs. So to begin changing your judgmental thinking, the first step is to recognize when you\u2019re being judgmental and critical. On page 87 is a Negative Judgments Record. For the next week, do your best to keep track\nof all the negative judgments and criticisms that you make. This includes those you make about\nthings you read in the newspaper or see on television, judgments you make about yourself and\nother people, and so on. Make photocopies of the Negative Judgments Record if you need to, and\nkeep one folded in your pocket so that you can record your judgments as soon as you recognize\nthat you\u2019re making them. If you decide that you\u2019re only going to write down your negative judgments once a day, such as before you go to sleep, the process of learning radical acceptance will\ntake longer. At the end of the day, you might forget many of the negative judgments that you\u2019ve\nmade.\nIn order to remind yourself to write down your negative judgments, it might help to give\nyourself visual reminders. Some people have found that wearing something special to remind them,\nlike a new ring or a bracelet, prods their memories to write down their judgments. Other people\nput up sticky notes around their home and office with the word \u201cjudgments\u201d written on them.\nUse whatever works best for you. Do this exercise for at least one week, or until you recognize\nthat you\u2019re starting to catch yourself in the moment when you\u2019re making negative judgments. Keep\ntrack of when you made the judgment, where you were, and what the negative judgment was. Use\nthe following example to help you.\n(NOTE: When you have completed a Negative Judgments Record, keep it to use in the Judgment\nDefusion exercise later in this chapter.)\nAdvanced Mindfulness Skills 91\n[Page 101]\nExAMPLE: NEGATIvE JuDGMENTS RECORD\nWhen?

Where? What?\nAdvanced Mindfulness Skills 93\n[Page 103]\nRADICAL ACCEPTANCE AND BEGINNER\u2019S MIND\nNow that you\u2019ve recognized many of your negative judgments, you\u2019re closer to using full radical\nacceptance. Remember, radical acceptance means that you observe situations in your life without\njudging or criticizing yourself or others. In the previous exercise, you focused on recognizing your\nnegative judgments because they are usually the easiest ones to spot. But positive judgments can\nalso be problematic.\nRemember the example of Thomas we recently gave you? He divided everyone into two\ncategories: either all good or all bad. He liked people when they were good, but when they did\nsomething to upset him, he got angry and labeled them \u201cbad.\u201d So do you see how making even\npositive judgments about people or things can be problematic? When you think of someone (or\nsomething) with a rigid and predetermined idea of how that person is going to treat you, then\nit\u2019s easy to become disappointed, because no one (and nothing) is perfect. Presidents sometimes\nlie, religious people sometimes gamble, things that we like sometimes break, and people we trust\nsometimes hurt us. As a result, when you put someone into a category of being 100 percent good,\ntrustworthy, saintly, wholesome, or honest, it\u2019s very easy to get disappointed.\nBut this doesn\u2019t mean that you should never trust anyone. What radical acceptance says is\nthat you should approach people and situations in your life without judging them to be good or\nbad, positive or negative. In some forms of meditation, this is called beginner\u2019s mind (Suzuki, 2001).\nThis means that you should enter every situation and every relationship as if you were seeing it\nfor the very first time. This reoccurring newness prevents you from bringing any old judgments\n(good or bad) into the present moment, which allows you to stay more mindful. Plus, by keeping\nthe situation fresh, it also helps you stay in better control of your emotions. As a result, it\u2019s easy to\nsee why one of the goals of dialectical behavior therapy is to help you stop making any judgments\nat all, either positive or negative (Linehan, 1993b).\nExercise: Beginner\u2019s Mind\nIn the following exercise, you\u2019ll practice using radical acceptance and beginner\u2019s mind. This exercise is similar to the last one, but now you will need to be aware of both the positive and negative\njudgments that you make. Again, if you need to use visual reminders to help you remember to\nwrite down your judgments, use whatever works for you: a bracelet, a ring, a sticky note with the\nword \u201cjudgment\u201d on it, and so on.\nDo this exercise for at least one week or until you recognize that you\u2019re starting to catch\nyourself in the moments when you\u2019re making both positive and negative judgments. Keep track of\nwhen you made the judgment, where you were, and what the positive or negative judgment was.\n94 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 104]\nAs with the last exercise, make photocopies of the Beginner\u2019s Mind Record if you need to, and\nkeep one folded in your pocket so that you can record your judgments as soon as you recognize\nthat you\u2019re making them. The more quickly you record them after they occur, the sooner radical\nacceptance will become a regular part of your life. Use the example of the Beginner\u2019s Mind Record\non the following page to help you. The blank Beginner\u2019s Mind Record for your use is on the page\nafter that.\n(NOTE: When you have completed a Beginner\u2019s Mind Record, keep it to use in the Judgment\nDefusion exercise later in this chapter.)\nJuDGMENTS AND LABELS\nHopefully, after the last exercise, it\u2019s easy to see how putting labels on people, thoughts, and\nobjects\u2014making them either good or bad\u2014can later lead to disappointment. In order to move\ncloser to using radical acceptance, the next exercise will continue to help you monitor the judgments that you make and then it will help you let go of those judgments.\nSo far in this chapter, you\u2019ve already recognized many of the problems associated with making\njudgments:\n\u000e Judgments can trigger overwhelming emotions.\n\u000e Judgments can often lead to disappointment and suffering.\n\u000e Judgments prevent you from being truly mindful in the present moment.\nObviously, one of the problems with judgments and criticisms is that they occupy your\nthoughts. In many cases, it can become very easy to start obsessing on a single judgment. Perhaps\nyou\u2019ve even had the experience of a single judgment occupying your thoughts all day. Maybe it was\nsomething bad about yourself or someone else. Or maybe it was something good about yourself or\nsomeone else. We\u2019ve all had this experience. So when your thoughts are occupied by something\nthat happened in the past or by something that might happen in the future, how mindful are you\nbeing about the present moment? Probably you\u2019re not being very mindful. And when those obsessive thoughts are judgments about yourself or someone else, how easy is it for your emotions to get\ntriggered? Probably it\u2019s very easy, especially if you struggle with overwhelming emotions.\nAdvanced Mindfulness Skills 95\n[Page 105]\nExAMPLE: BEGINNER\u2019S MIND RECORD\nWhen? Where?

Where? What?\nAdvanced Mindfulness Skills 97\n[Page 107]\nExercise: Judgment Defusion\nThe following Judgment Defusion exercise is designed to help you release or \u201clet go\u201d of your judgments and other obsessive thoughts. In the last chapter, you practiced using the thought defusion\ntechnique as a basic mindfulness exercise. This exercise is very similar. Again, the object is to\nwatch your judgments arise and then to let go of them without getting stuck on them.\nLike thought defusion, judgment defusion also requires the use of your imagination. The\nobject of this exercise is to visualize your judgments, either as pictures or words, harmlessly floating\naway from you without obsessing about them or analyzing them. Whichever way you choose to do\nthis is okay. If you used a technique in the last chapter that worked, use it again here. If you need a\nnew visualization technique, here are just a few suggestions that other people have found helpful:\n\u000e Imagine sitting in a field watching your judgments float away on clouds.\n\u000e Picture yourself sitting beside a stream watching your judgments float past on leaves.\n\u000e Picture yourself standing in a room with two doors; then watch your judgments\nenter through one door and leave through the other.\nIf one of these ideas works for you, that\u2019s great. If not, feel free to create your own. Just be\nsure that your idea captures the purpose of this exercise, which is to visually watch your judgments\ncome and go without holding on to them and without analyzing them.\nBefore you begin this exercise, review the records you filled out for the Negative Judgments\nexercise and the Beginner\u2019s Mind exercise, in order to refamiliarize yourself with some of the judgments you\u2019ve made over the last few weeks. You can even keep these records near you so you can\nrefer to them if you have trouble remembering any of your recent judgments. During the exercise,\nyou will close your eyes and imagine whichever visualization technique you\u2019ve chosen. Then you\u2019ll\nwatch your past judgments (and any new judgments) come into your thoughts and float away,\nwithout you getting stuck on them.\nRead the instructions before beginning the exercise to familiarize yourself with the experience. If you feel more comfortable listening to the instructions, use an audio-recording device\nto record the instructions in a slow, even voice so you can listen to them while practicing this\ntechnique. When you are first using judgment defusion, set a kitchen timer or an alarm clock for\nthree to five minutes and practice letting go of your thoughts until the alarm goes off. Then, as\nyou get more accustomed to using this technique, you can set the alarm for longer periods of time,\nlike eight to ten minutes.\nInstructions\nTo begin, find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won\u2019t be disturbed for as long as\nyou\u2019ve set your timer. Turn off any distracting sounds. Take a few slow, long breaths, relax, and close\nyour eyes.\n98 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 108]\nNow, in your imagination, picture yourself in the scenario that you chose in order to watch your\njudgments come and go, whether it\u2019s by a stream, in a field, in a room, or somewhere else. Do your best\nto imagine yourself in that scene. After you do, start to become aware of the judgments that you\u2019re having,\njust like in the last exercises in which you wrote down your judgments. Start to observe the judgments\nthat are coming up, whatever they are. Don\u2019t try to stop your thoughts, and do your best not to criticize\nyourself for any of the judgments. Just watch the judgments arise, and then, using whatever technique\nyou\u2019ve chosen, watch the judgments disappear. If you need to refer to any of the records from the past\nexercises to remind yourself of recent judgments, feel free to do that. But then close your eyes and watch\nthose judgments float away.\nWhatever the judgment is, big or small, important or unimportant, watch the judgment arise in your\nmind and then let it float away or disappear by whichever means you\u2019ve chosen. Just continue to watch\nthe judgments arise and disappear. Use pictures to represent the thoughts or words, whatever works best\nfor you. Do your best to watch the judgments arise and disappear without getting hooked into them and\nwithout criticizing yourself. If more than one judgment comes up at the same time, see them both arise\nand disappear. If the judgments come very quickly, do your best to watch them all disappear without\ngetting hooked on any of them. Continue to breathe and watch the judgments come and go until your\ntimer goes off.\nWhen you\u2019ve finished, take a few more slow, long breaths, and then slowly open your eyes and\nreturn your focus to the room.\nNONJuDGMENT AND YOuR DAILY ExPERIENCES\nThe purpose of the previous exercise is to help you let go of your judgments, and the more you\npractice it, the easier it will get. Then, after you\u2019ve been practicing it regularly for at least a few\nweeks, it will become easy for you to let go of your judgments in the present moment. Hopefully,\nthere will come a day, very soon, when a judgment will arise in your thoughts, either positive\nor negative, and you\u2019ll simply let it go. Maybe you\u2019ll need to close your eyes for a few seconds, if\nyou\u2019re in a place where that\u2019s safe, and visualize the thought floating away. Or maybe you\u2019ll be in\na conversation with someone when a judgment arises in your thoughts, and you\u2019ll simply be able\nto let it go. That is when you will truly be using radical acceptance.\nExercise: Judgments vs . the Present Moment\nNow that you\u2019ve practiced being mindful of your thoughts, feelings, and senses in the previous\nchapter, and you\u2019ve practiced being mindful of your judgments in this chapter, the next step is to\ncombine the two experiences. In this exercise you will learn to shift your attention back and forth\nin a mindful, focused way between your judgments and your physical sensations.\nWhen you spend a lot of time obsessing over your thoughts and judgments, it\u2019s easy to get\nlost in your own fantasies about how the world should be. But again, these fantasies often lead to\nAdvanced Mindfulness Skills 99\n[Page 109]\ndisappointment and suffering. As you continue to practice your mindfulness skills in your life, it\nwill continue to be important to recognize and separate your judgments and fantasies from what\u2019s\nreally happening in the moment. One of the easiest ways to do this is to become mindful of your\nphysical senses\u2014what you notice using your eyes, ears, nose, and senses of touch and taste. Often,\npeople refer to this as grounding themselves. Grounding yourself in your physical sensations can\nstop you from obsessing over your judgments, and by doing so it will also help you become more\nmindful of what\u2019s happening in the present moment.\nRead the following instructions before beginning the exercise to familiarize yourself with\nthe experience. Then you can either keep these instructions near you if you need to refer to\nthem while you\u2019re doing the exercise, or you can record them in a slow, even voice on an audiorecording device so that you can listen to them while you practice shifting your focus between your\njudgments and your present-moment awareness.\nInstructions\nTo begin, find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won\u2019t be disturbed for ten minutes.\nTurn off any distracting sounds. Take a few slow, long breaths, close your eyes, and relax.\nNow, keeping your eyes closed, focus your attention on the weight of your body as it rests on the seat\nin which you\u2019re sitting. Notice the weight of your feet and legs resting on the ground. Notice the weight\nof your hands and arms resting. Notice the weight of your head resting on top of your neck. Mentally\nscan your body from head to toe and notice any sensations that you feel. Take your time. [Pause here\nfor one minute if you are recording the instructions.]\nNow notice any tension you might be feeling anywhere in your body, and imagine the tension\nmelting away like wax in the hot sun. Again, take your time to scan your body for any tension, and keep\ntaking slow, deep breaths. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions.]\nWhen you are finished scanning your body, move your focus to your thoughts and judgments. Just\nnotice any thoughts or judgments that arise in your mind, and when they do, allow them to float away\nby whichever means you found successful in the last exercises. Allow the thoughts and judgments to\nleave you without getting stuck on them. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing slow, long breaths.\n[Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions.]\nNow redirect your attention to your sense of hearing. Notice any sounds that you can hear coming\nfrom outside your room, and note to yourself what they are. Now become aware of any sounds you hear\ncoming from inside the room, and note to yourself what they are. Try to notice even small sounds, such\nas the ticking of a clock, the sound of the wind, or the beating of your heart. If you become distracted by\nany thoughts, return your focus to your sense of hearing. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing.\n[Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions.]\nWhen you are finished noticing any sounds, once again redirect your focus to your thoughts and\njudgments. Notice any thoughts or judgments that arise in your mind, and when they do, allow them to\nfloat away by whichever means you found successful in the last exercises. Allow the thoughts and judgments to leave you without getting stuck on them. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing slow,\ndeep breaths. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions.]\n100 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 110]\nNow, once again, redirect your attention. This time, put your focus on your sense of smell. Notice\nany smells that are in the room, pleasant or otherwise. If you don\u2019t notice any smells, just become aware\nof the flow of air moving into your nostrils as you breathe in through your nose. Try your best to maintain\nyour focus on your sense of smell. If you become distracted by any thoughts, return your focus to your\nnose. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing slow, deep breaths. [Pause here for one minute if\nyou are recording the instructions.]\nWhen you are finished noticing any smells, once again redirect your focus to your thoughts and\njudgments. Notice any thoughts or judgments that arise in your mind, and when they do, allow them to\nfloat away by whichever means you found successful in the last exercises. Allow the thoughts and judgments to leave you without getting stuck on them. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing slow,\nlong breaths. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions.]\nNow redirect your attention to your sense of touch. Notice the sensation of whatever your hands\nare resting on. Or, keeping your eyes closed, reach out with one of your hands to touch an object that\nis within reach. Or, if there is no object within reach, touch the chair you\u2019re sitting in or touch your leg.\nNotice what the object feels like. Notice if it\u2019s smooth or rough. Notice if it\u2019s pliable or rigid. Notice if it\u2019s\nsoft or solid. Notice what the sensations feel like on the skin of your fingertips. If your thoughts begin to\ndistract you, simply return your focus to the object that you\u2019re touching. Take a minute to do this, and keep\nbreathing slow, long breaths. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions.]\nWhen you are finished noticing any touch sensations, once again redirect your focus to your thoughts\nand judgments. Notice any thoughts or judgments that arise in your mind, and when they do, allow them\nto float away by whichever means you found successful in the last exercises. Allow the thoughts and\njudgments to leave you without getting stuck on them. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing slow,\nlong breaths. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions.]\nNow, slowly, open your eyes. Keep breathing slow, deep breaths. Take a few minutes to focus your\nvisual attention on the room you\u2019re sitting in. Notice the objects that are in the room. Notice how light\nor dark the room is. Notice the different colors that are in the room. Notice where you are in the room.\nMove your head to look around. Take in all the visual information that you can. If your thoughts begin\nto distract you, simply return your focus to the room you\u2019re looking at. Take a minute to do this, and keep\nbreathing slow, long breaths. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions.]\nWhen you have finished noticing any visual sensations, once again redirect your focus to your\nthoughts and judgments. But this time, keep your eyes open. Pick a few objects in the room to focus on.\nBut in your mind, continue to notice any thoughts and judgments that arise, and when they do, allow\nthem to float away. Allow the thoughts and judgments to leave you without getting stuck on them. If\nyou need to close your eyes to do this, that\u2019s okay. But open your eyes once the thoughts have floated\naway, and return your focus to the room you\u2019re in. Continue to monitor your thoughts and judgments\nand continue to let them go without getting stuck on them. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing\nslow, long breaths. [Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions.]\nWhen you\u2019ve finished, if you still have time left, continue to switch your focus between your thoughts\nand judgments and what you notice visually. Then, when your timer goes off, take three to five slow, long\nbreaths and return your focus to the room.\nAdvanced Mindfulness Skills 101\n[Page 111]\nMINDFuL COMMuNICATION WITH OTHERS\nAs you continue to practice mindfulness skills by yourself, it\u2019s also very important that you begin\nto incorporate these skills into your interactions with others. Mindful communication is often the\nkey to a successful relationship. If you\u2019re constantly making judgmental statements to someone, the\nchances are good that you\u2019ll lose that relationship. In the chapters on interpersonal effectiveness\nskills, you will learn how to ask others for what you need in a healthy way. But for now, let\u2019s look\nat how to be more mindful of the messages you send to other people.\nConsider the following statements:\n\u000e \u201cYou make me mad.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cYou\u2019re such a jerk, I could scream.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cSometimes you make me so upset I just want to end it all.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cI know that you did that to me on purpose just to hurt me.\u201d\nWhat do all of these statements have in common? It\u2019s true that they all express some kind\nof emotion, such as anger, distress, and sadness. But more importantly, they\u2019re all judgments of the\nother person. Each of the statements blames the other person for the way the speaker feels. Now\nconsider how you would feel if someone said one of these statements to you. What would you do?\nMaybe you would say something just as angry back to the person, which would lead to a big fight.\nThe result would be that nothing gets resolved. Or maybe you would just shut down emotionally,\nstop listening, or walk away. Again, nothing would get resolved. Judgmental statements like these\nstop any form of effective communication. So what can you do instead?\nOne of the solutions is to turn \u201cyou\u201d statements into mindful \u201cI\u201d statements.\n\u000e Mindful \u201cI\u201d statements are based on your own mindful awareness of how you feel.\n\u000e Mindful \u201cI\u201d statements are a more accurate description of how you feel.\n\u000e Mindful \u201cI\u201d statements let a person know how you feel in a nonjudgmental way.\n\u000e Mindful \u201cI\u201d statements evoke greater empathy and understanding from the other\nperson, which allows the person to meet your needs.\nLet\u2019s look at the four previous examples and turn them from \u201cyou\u201d statements into mindful\n\u201cI\u201d statements.\nInstead of saying \u201cYou make me mad,\u201d say \u201cRight now, I feel very mad.\u201d Doesn\u2019t that sound\nless judgmental and blaming? If someone said the alternative statement to you (\u201cI feel very mad\u201d),\nwouldn\u2019t you be more willing to discuss the situation? Wouldn\u2019t you feel less angry?\nLook at the second sentence. Instead of saying \u201cYou\u2019re such a jerk, I could scream,\u201d say \u201cI\nfeel so angry right now I could scream.\u201d Do you hear the difference it makes to change a \u201cyou\u201d\nstatement into an \u201cI\u201d statement? The other person no longer feels blamed and will be more willing\nto listen.\n102 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 112]\nLet\u2019s look at the third sentence. Instead of saying \u201cSometimes you make me so upset I just\nwant to end it all,\u201d say \u201cI feel so upset and hopeless sometimes that I get very depressed.\u201d\nAnd finally, look at the last sentence. Instead of saying \u201cI know that you did that to me on\npurpose just to hurt me,\u201d say \u201cI felt very hurt when you did that.\u201d\nAgain, mindful \u201cI\u201d statements are more accurate about how you feel, they are less judgmental,\nthe other person will probably be more willing and able to listen to you if you use them, and most\nimportantly, you are more likely to get your needs met if you use them.\nExercise: Mindful \u201cI\u201d Statements\nNow let\u2019s look at some more judgmental \u201cyou\u201d statements and have you practice turning them into\nmindful \u201cI\u201d statements. Write your alternative mindful \u201cI\u201d statement in the space to the right of\nthe judgmental statement.\n1 . \u201cYou make me feel horrible.\u201d\n2 . \u201cI know you\u2019re doing this on purpose to make me go crazy.\u201d\n3 . \u201cWhy do you keep making me feel so angry?\u201d\n4 . \u201cYou\u2019re being insulting.\u201d\n5 . \u201cStop fooling around; you\u2019re getting on my nerves.\u201d\n6 . \u201cIf you don\u2019t listen to what I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m not going to talk to you anymore.\u201d\n7 . \u201cYou\u2019re being a jerk, stop it.\u201d\n8 . \u201cYou\u2019re such a @%&!*#!, I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n9 . \u201cWhy do you keep doing that to me?\u201d\n10 . \u201cSometimes I feel like you\u2019re being too inflexible.\u201d\nHow did you do? Did it get harder to think of mindful \u201cI\u201d statements as the exercise progressed? Some of the later sentences probably required extra thinking. Let\u2019s look at some possible\nanswers.\nThe first sentence was easy. The message is that the speaker feels horrible. So an alternative\nmindful \u201cI\u201d statement could be \u201cI feel horrible\u201d or \u201cI feel horrible sometimes, when you (say that,\ndo that, and so on).\u201d\nIn the second sentence, the speaker feels crazy, anxious, or upset. So an alternative mindful\n\u201cI\u201d statement could be \u201cI feel crazy/anxious/upset when you do that.\u201d\nIn the third sentence, the speaker feels angry. So an alternative mindful \u201cI\u201d statement could\nbe \u201cI feel angry right now.\u201d\nAdvanced Mindfulness Skills 103\n[Page 113]\nIn the fourth sentence, the speaker feels insulted or foolish. So an alternative mindful \u201cI\u201d\nstatement could be \u201cI feel like an idiot when you do that.\u201d\nIn the fifth sentence, the speaker feels anxious, tired, or angry. So an alternative mindful \u201cI\u201d\nstatement could be \u201cI feel anxious/tired/angry when you tease me like that.\u201d\nIn the sixth sentence, the speaker feels insulted, unheard, and ignored. But he or she also\nprobably feels upset about being ignored. So an alternative mindful \u201cI\u201d statement could be \u201cI feel\nupset when you ignore me.\u201d\nIn the seventh sentence, the speaker might feel many things. Usually, when you ask someone\nto stop doing something, it\u2019s because the action hurts. So maybe the speaker feels hurt, and an\nalternative mindful \u201cI\u201d statement could be \u201cI feel hurt when you do that.\u201d\nThe eighth sentence is trickier. The speaker calls the other person some insulting expletive.\nThis also usually indicates that the speaker\u2019s feelings have been hurt. So an alternative mindful \u201cI\u201d\nstatement could be similar to the last sentence: \u201cI feel very hurt when you do that.\u201d\nThe ninth sentence is phrased as a question, but it\u2019s really a statement about how the speaker\nfeels. Again, the implication is that the speaker feels hurt, insulted, belittled, or something similar.\nSo an alternative mindful \u201cI\u201d statement could be any version of these: \u201cI feel very hurt (or insulted,\nor whatever) when you do that to me.\u201d\nAnd lastly, the tenth sentence is the trickiest because the speaker uses the word \u201cfeel.\u201d Maybe\nyou were tricked into thinking that this sentence didn\u2019t need to be changed. But this sentence is\nreally a hidden judgment about the other person. What the speaker really means is \u201cI think you\u2019re\ntoo inflexible.\u201d But people often exchange the word \u201cthink\u201d for \u201cfeel\u201d in order to hide their criticism or make their judgment sound less harsh. However, now you know better, so don\u2019t fall into\nthe same trap. In this case, something about the other person\u2019s inflexible actions make the speaker\nfeel uncomfortable or trapped. Maybe the other person never considers other points of view before\nhe or she makes decisions. So an alternative mindful \u201cI\u201d statement could be \u201cI feel uncomfortable\nwhen you don\u2019t consider my point of view.\u201d\nMindful \u201cI\u201d statements are clearly a more effective way of communicating how you feel and\nwhat you need, but they depend on your mindful awareness of your own feelings. Hopefully, after\npracticing the exercises in the last two chapters, you\u2019ve become more skilled at recognizing your\nown emotions and you can start using mindful \u201cI\u201d statements to let others know how you feel.\nDOING WHAT\u2019S EFFECTIvE\nUsing successful communication skills, such as mindful \u201cI\u201d statements, is a part of what dialectical\nbehavior therapy calls \u201cdoing what\u2019s effective\u201d (Linehan, 1993b). This means that you do what\u2019s\nappropriate and necessary in the present moment\u2014to resolve a problem, cope with a situation,\nor reach your goal\u2014even if what you do feels unnatural, uncomfortable, or it goes against what\nyou are experiencing emotionally. For example, you\u2019re probably not comfortable making statements\nlike the ones you made in the last exercise, where you speak directly to the other person about\nhow you feel. But sometimes in order to get what you want, you have to modify what you feel like\n104 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 114]\ndoing, especially if you struggle with overwhelming emotions. Here are some other examples of\ndoing what\u2019s effective:\n\u000e You\u2019re in the grocery store shopping for your weekly supply of food, but unfortunately, so are many other people. After shopping for an hour and waiting in line\nfor fifteen minutes, you feel exhausted. You\u2019re so tired and annoyed that you think\nabout leaving your shopping cart and just walking out. But if you did walk out,\nthen you\u2019d be without groceries for a week or you\u2019d just have to start all over again\nat some other supermarket. So you stay in line and just get it over with.\n\u000e You\u2019re driving down the freeway and the car in front of you is driving below the\nspeed limit in the left-hand lane. You feel so angry that you think about smashing\ninto the car to push it out of the way. But if you did, you and the other driver\nwould be seriously injured, and chances are you\u2019d also get arrested. So you patiently\nwait for a chance to pass the driver, or you wait for your exit and then get off the\nfreeway.\n\u000e You and your romantic partner get into a big argument. Both of you are yelling.\nYou feel so hurt and upset that you think about walking out the door and ending\nthe relationship. But in the back of your mind, you also recognize that this is the\nbest relationship you\u2019ve had in a long time, and you wish that it would work out.\nSo, instead of leaving, you take a deep breath and use mindful \u201cI\u201d statements to\nlet your partner know how you\u2019re feeling.\n\u000e Your boss gives you a new task even though you\u2019re already burdened with more\nwork than you have time for. You feel insulted, angry, and taken advantage of.\nYou\u2019re so mad that you think about screaming at your boss, telling him off, quitting,\nand walking out the door. But if you did, then you\u2019d be without a paycheck for a\nlong time. So you decide to bite your tongue for now until you can speak to your\nboss more calmly at some point in the near future, and you do the best you can.\n\u000e You ask your friend to take you shopping because she has a car and you don\u2019t. But\nyour friend says she can\u2019t because she\u2019s busy doing something else. You feel annoyed\nand angry because you help her all the time when she asks you. You want to yell at\nher and tell her what a lousy friend she is. But if you did, you might lose her friendship completely. So instead of yelling, you call a different friend to ask for a ride.\nAs you can see, doing what\u2019s effective sometimes means not doing what you feel like doing\nor not doing what you\u2019ve been habitually doing for many years. This is why mindfulness is such\nan important part of doing what\u2019s effective. If you\u2019re going to change the way you behave in the\npresent moment, you have to be aware of what you\u2019re thinking, feeling, and doing in the present\nmoment so that you can choose to do what\u2019s effective.\nDoing what\u2019s effective also depends on not making judgments. You already know that making\nboth positive and negative judgments can lead to disappointment and suffering. But making judgments about situations and your actions can also prevent you from doing what\u2019s effective. Here\u2019s\nAdvanced Mindfulness Skills 105\n[Page 115]\nan example: Judith had a math teacher who assigned homework that Judith thought was too hard.\n\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d she thought to herself. \u201cHow unfair of him to give us these assignments. This\nis wrong; he shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do this. I\u2019m not going to do the homework.\u201d So she didn\u2019t. But\nas a result, she failed the class. Judith\u2019s judgments about what was \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d prevented\nher from doing what was effective. Clearly, it would have been more beneficial to her if she had\nremained mindful of her thoughts and feelings, avoided judging the assignments, and just done\nthe best that she could.\nDoing what\u2019s effective is doing what is necessary in a given situation in order to get a resolution to a problem. Doing what\u2019s effective isn\u2019t \u201cselling out,\u201d \u201cgiving up,\u201d or \u201ccaving in.\u201d\nDoing what\u2019s effective is a skill, just like acting. Sometimes in order to get what you want,\nyou have to behave in a certain way. Sometimes you have to act as if you are competent, skilled,\nor satisfied in order to reach your goal, even if you don\u2019t feel that way. And that\u2019s what effective\nactions are designed to do\u2014help you reach your goals. In the example above, Judith\u2019s goal was to\nget a satisfactory grade in her math class. But she allowed her judgments and feelings to prevent\nher from reaching that goal.\nRemember, in order to do what\u2019s effective, you have to do the following:\n\u000e Be mindful of your thoughts and feelings.\n\u000e Avoid judging the situation or your actions.\n\u000e Choose actions that are appropriate and necessary to reach your goal.\n\u000e Do the best you can.\nBEING MINDFuL IN YOuR DAILY LIFE\nNow that you\u2019ve almost completed these two chapters on mindfulness skills, you probably recognize\nthe benefits of being mindful in your daily life. But to be realistic, no one is mindful all the time.\nThere will certainly be moments in your life when you\u2019ll forget to be mindful. So what should you\ndo?\nIn his book Living the Mindful Life: A Handbook for Living in the Present Moment, psychologist\nCharles Tart (1994, p. 13) remarks: \u201cIt does not take a really strenuous effort to make yourself\nbecome mindful and more present. The effort is very small. The problem is remembering to do it!\nWe forget all the time. It is not hard, but we just do not remember to do it.\u201d So how should you\nremember to be mindful? Throughout his book, Dr. Tart uses a bell that rings at random times to\nremind the reader to be mindful of how he or she is thinking and feeling. But if you don\u2019t want to\nuse a random bell, there are other ways to remind yourself. In some of the exercises in this chapter,\nyou might have used a special ring or bracelet to remind yourself. Or maybe you used sticky notes.\nIf those tools helped you, continue to use them to remind yourself to stay mindful.\nHowever, the best way to continue to stay mindful in your daily life is to practice being\nmindful. The more you practice, the more you will remember to stay mindful. As part of the last\n106 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 116]\nexercise in this section, we have designed a simple daily mindfulness regimen to help you continue\npracticing your skills. It\u2019s very important that you continue to use these skills, and to practice other\nmindfulness exercises that you think are necessary, even as you move on to learning other dialectical behavior skills in this workbook. Mindfulness skills are so important to the overall effectiveness\nof dialectical behavior therapy that they have been labeled \u201ccore\u201d skills (Linehan, 1993a).\nDAILY MINDFuLNESS REGIMEN\nYour daily mindfulness regimen will consist of three skills that you\u2019ve already learned:\n1 . Mindful breathing\n2 . Wise-mind meditation\n3 . Doing tasks mindfully\nMindful breathing is a skill you learned in chapter 3, Basic Mindfulness Skills. Remember, to\nbreathe mindfully, you need to focus on three parts of the experience:\n1 . You must count your breaths. This will help you focus your attention, and it will also\nhelp you calm your mind when you\u2019re distracted by thoughts.\n2 . You need to focus on the physical experience of breathing. This is accomplished by\nobserving the rising and falling of your breath as you slowly inhale and exhale.\n3 . You need to be aware of any distracting thoughts that arise while you are breathing.\nThen you need to let the thoughts float past without getting stuck on them, as you did\nin the Thought Defusion exercise. Letting go of the distracting thoughts will allow you\nto refocus your attention on your breathing and help you further calm yourself.\nPractice breathing mindfully for three to five minutes a day at a minimum. But if you want\nto practice it longer, do it for as long as you can. Remember, the more frequently you practice\nmindfulness skills, the calmer you will feel and the more control you will have over your presentmoment experiences. Refer to the Mindful Breathing exercise in chapter 3 if you need to review\nthe instructions.\nThe wise-mind meditation is a skill you learned earlier in this chapter. It will help you focus\nyour attention on your center of wise mind, which is also sometimes called your center of intuition\nor \u201cgut feelings.\u201d Remember, wise mind is just one decision-making process that many people find\nhelpful. It incorporates using both your emotion mind and your reasonable mind, meaning that\nwise-mind decisions require you to reflect on how you feel as well as the facts of a situation. This\nskill also helps you make intuitive decisions that \u201cfeel\u201d right to you. Wise-mind meditation will help\nyou make decisions based on the way your body reacts to a decision and your own inner knowledge\n(what you know to be \u201ctrue\u201d for you). Again, practice the wise-mind meditation for at least three\nto five minutes a day, or longer if you want to.\nAdvanced Mindfulness Skills 107\n[Page 117]\nAnd finally, your daily mindfulness regimen will include doing tasks mindfully. This might\nsound like a new skill to you, but you\u2019ve already practiced doing all the steps that are necessary.\nDoing tasks mindfully means doing all the things you normally do in your life, like talking, walking,\neating, and washing, while also staying focused on your thoughts, emotions, physical sensations,\nand actions in the present moment, and without judging what is happening. In effect, this is the\nexercise where all the skills you\u2019ve learned in the last two chapters finally come together.\nTo do tasks mindfully, you need to do the following:\n\u000e Focus and shift your attention between your thoughts, feelings, physical sensations,\nand actions in order to be mindful of your present-moment experience.\n\u000e Let go of distracting thoughts and judgments by allowing them to float past without\ngetting stuck on them so that you don\u2019t get distracted from what\u2019s happening in\nthe present moment.\n\u000e Use radical acceptance to remain nonjudgmental.\n\u000e Use wise mind to make healthy decisions about your life.\n\u000e Do what\u2019s effective in order to accomplish your goals.\nSome people find it helpful to use the following memory device to remind themselves to do\ntasks mindfully:\n\u201cMindfulness is like a FLAME.\u201d\nFocus and shift your attention to be mindful of the present moment.\nLet go of distracting thoughts and judgments.\nUse radical Acceptance to remain nonjudgmental.\nUse wise Mind to make healthy decisions.\nDo what\u2019s Effective to accomplish your goals.\nLet\u2019s look at some examples of doing tasks mindfully, using all the skills you\u2019ve learned in\nchapters 3 and 4.\nAfter reading these two chapters, Loretta began approaching many of her tasks mindfully.\nAt night, she would even brush her teeth mindfully. First, she focused her attention on how the\ntoothbrush felt in her hand and how the tube felt as she squeezed out the paste. She was also\naware of how her body felt, standing in front of the bathroom mirror, and how the weight of her\nbody felt as she stood in front of the sink. Then, as she began to brush, she became aware of the\ntaste in her mouth, the feel of the bristles on her gums, and the movement of her arm as she\nbrushed. When distracting thoughts arose, such as things she did earlier in the day, she imagined\nthe thoughts floating down a river on a leaf. If judgments arose about people she knew, she did\nthe same thing and watched the judgments float away. Then she continued to shift her focus every\nfew moments to her breathing, feeling it rise and fall. Loretta did a good job being as aware as\npossible of simply brushing her teeth in that moment. At other times throughout the day, she had\n108 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 118]\nsimilar experiences with other activities. When she washed the dishes, she paid attention to how\nthe water felt and to the smell of the dish soap. While she was cooking, she was very aware of\nthe heat from the stove, the sensation of hunger in her stomach, the sound of the water boiling,\nand her distracting judgments, which usually concerned whether or not her husband would like\nthe meal. She did her best to let those judgments go and to be as fully present in the moment of\ncooking as she could be.\nSimilarly, Scott did his best to be mindful throughout the day. As he walked, he focused his\nattention on how his feet felt as they touched the pavement. Sometimes, he was even aware of how\nhis feet felt moving in his socks. Then he would shift his focus to what he was seeing. He visually\nscanned what was around him as he walked, and he made mental notes to himself: \u201cRight now, I\u2019m\nseeing a woman, a tree, a building,\u201d and so on. When distracting thoughts arose, he imagined the\nthoughts coming in one door and leaving through another. If he saw someone on the street whom\nhe didn\u2019t like and judgments arose, he would also let those judgments go. Similarly, if positive judgments arose about people or places he liked, he did his best to let those go too. For example, once\nhe caught himself thinking \u201cOh look, there\u2019s Mike. He\u2019s the guy that loaned me twenty dollars\nthat time. He\u2019s the greatest guy in the world. I wish I could be more like him.\u201d Scott knew that\nhe couldn\u2019t stop those judgments from arising, but instead of getting stuck on them, he would let\nthem go. And if the judgments came back, he would let them go again.\nBut clearly, the greatest challenge to using mindfulness skills is when you are interacting with\nsomeone else. Talking or arguing with someone and being mindful at the same time is often difficult. But it is also the most important time to be mindful, especially for someone struggling with\noverwhelming emotions. Here\u2019s an example.\nClaire had been practicing her mindfulness skills for a few weeks when she went shopping for\na new dress with her friend Laura. Sometimes, Claire worried that Laura really didn\u2019t like her. As\na result, when Laura made suggestions, Claire did whatever Laura wanted because she was afraid\nof losing Laura\u2019s friendship. However, Claire didn\u2019t like the fact that Laura pushed her into doing\nthings.\nOn the way to the store, Claire drove and she did her best to remain mindful of what she\nwas doing. She felt the steering wheel in her hands. She felt the weight of her body resting in the\nseat. She felt her breath rising and falling as she breathed. She was also very aware of what she was\nseeing, especially the other cars. But she was also very aware of Laura talking to her as she drove.\nNaturally, judgments about Laura came up while Claire was driving, and she did her best to just\nlet them go. However, some judgments were easier to let go of than others.\nWhen they got to the shopping mall, Claire also had opportunities to use radical acceptance.\nThere were certain stores she liked and certain stores she didn\u2019t like. At first, she was positive that\nshe would find the \u201cperfect\u201d dress in the store she really liked because they always had the \u201cbest\u201d\nclothes. But quickly, Claire recognized the positive judgments she was making, and she let them go.\nThat was lucky too, because none of the stores she liked had the dress she was looking for. In the\npast, she would have been crushed and gotten upset. But because of radical acceptance, her neutrality and her nonjudgmental attitude allowed her to cope with the situation in a healthier way.\nLater, the two women found themselves in a higher-end store looking at dresses that were\nmore expensive than what Claire could afford. However, both she and Laura found a dress that\nAdvanced Mindfulness Skills 109\n[Page 119]\nthey loved. Immediately, Laura began pressuring Claire to buy it. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about how much it\ncosts,\u201d Laura said. Claire looked at herself in the mirror and fell in love with the dress, regardless\nof the price tag. Claire was about to buy the dress when she remembered to use wise mind to help\nher make her decision. Her emotion mind loved the dress, but her reasonable mind reminded her\nthat she already had a hefty credit card bill and this dress was far too expensive. In the dressing\nroom, Claire took a few slow, deep breaths and put her hand on her center of wise mind. Her\nabdomen felt very nervous, not happy and excited. Instantly, she knew it was a very bad idea to\nbuy the expensive dress, so she gave it back to the salesclerk and left the store.\nClaire was proud of herself for making the right decision, but the drama didn\u2019t end there.\nLaura began making fun of Claire for being \u201ctoo cheap\u201d to buy the dress. Again, Claire\u2019s mind\nbegan to fill with judgments about Laura. She did her best to let them go, but as Laura continued\nto ridicule her, Claire\u2019s only goal became leaving the mall and dropping Laura at home. Internally,\nClaire wanted to scream at Laura, but she knew that would end up in a big fight. Claire thought\nabout doing what was effective in that moment. She knew that she just had to get home as quickly\nand safely as possible without getting into a fight that she might later regret.\nClaire drove home silently, listening to Laura\u2019s criticisms. She was relieved when she finally\nlet Laura off at her house. Later, when Claire was feeling less angry, she even found the courage\nto call Laura to discuss what happened. Claire did a great job using mindful \u201cI\u201d statements such\nas \u201cI felt hurt when you teased me.\u201d Laura understood and said she was sorry. Claire was proud of\nherself for handling the situation in a new, healthier way.\nBE MINDFuL OF YOuR MINDFuLNESS ACTIvITIES\nObviously, it will take lots of practice to become as mindful as Claire was in that situation. But\nhopefully, you see the benefits of using mindfulness in all of your daily tasks.\nIn the beginning of chapter 3, Basic Mindfulness Skills, you learned that there were three\nmain reasons why you should learn mindfulness skills:\n1 . They will help you focus on one thing at a time in the present moment, and by doing\nthis you can better control and soothe your overwhelming emotions.\n2 . They will help you learn to identify and separate judgmental thoughts from your\nexperiences.\n3 . They will help you develop wise mind.\nUnfortunately, there is no shortcut to becoming instantaneously and permanently mindful.\nBut as Dr. Charles Tart said, learning how to be mindful isn\u2019t a strenuous activity; you simply\nhave to remember to do it. So, however you need to remember to be mindful, we hope it works for\nyou. One way is to use the Weekly Mindfulness Activities Record on page 112. This will help you\nremember to follow your daily mindfulness regimen. Make photocopies of this page for each week\nto record how often you use mindful breathing, wise-mind meditation, and do tasks mindfully.\n110 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 120]\nUnder the headings of \u201cMindful Breathing\u201d and \u201cWise-Mind Meditation,\u201d record the length\nof time you spend doing each exercise. This will help you keep track of your improvement doing\nthese exercises. Under the headings of \u201cDoing Tasks Mindfully,\u201d record what it was that you did\nmindfully and where you were when you did it.\nThen, under the headings labeled \u201cOther Mindful Exercise,\u201d record any further mindfulness\nexercises that you do during the week.\nRemember, these mindfulness skills are \u201ccore\u201d skills in dialectical behavior therapy (Linehan,\n1993a). So continue to use them even as you move on to using the other skills in this workbook.\nRESISTANCES AND HINDRANCES TO\nMINDFuLNESS PRACTICE\nIt is common to encounter inner resistance and difficulties as you practice mindfulness and develop\nskills. What many people do not know is that there are some hindrances to mindfulness that are\nso common that they have been recognized by meditation teachers and practitioners for thousands\nof years!\nThis final section of the chapter will help you identify five common hindrances to mindfulness meditation and suggest ways you can work skillfully with each one.\nThe five Hindrances\nDesire, aversion, sleepiness, restlessness, and doubt are the five hindrances long recognized as\ncommon obstacles to meditation (and mindfulness) practice.\nThese energies appear as obstacles when they take you out of the present moment or cause\nyou to become lost in thoughts and feelings that interfere with your mindfulness practice of observing accurately and without judgment. However, they do not have to be obstacles. In truth, they can\nbecome your wisest teachers if you are willing to recognize, observe, and learn from them.\n\u000e Desire refers to the wish for things to be different\u2014right now! This can be a wish\nfor a different sense experience (to \u201cfeel better\u201d or \u201cfeel happy or peaceful,\u201d for\nexample) or to become someone or something different than what you experience\nyourself as now (become the \u201cperfect person\u201d or \u201cperfect meditator,\u201d for example).\n\u000e Aversion means having anger for or ill will toward what is here. Aversion includes\nother forms of resistance to present-moment experience, such as feeling bored or\nafraid. Often, the very activity of judgment or judgmental thinking is an expression\nof aversion.\nAdvanced Mindfulness Skills 111\n[Page 121]\n112 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\nDROCER\nSEITIvITCA\nSSENLuFDNIM\nYLKEEW\nfo\nkeew\neht\nroF\nlufdniM\nrehtO\nlufdniM\nrehtO\nsksaT\ngnioD\nsksaT\ngnioD\ndniM-esiW\nlufdniM\nyaD\nesicrexE\nesicrexE\nyllufdniM\nyllufdniM\nnoitatideM\ngnihtaerB\n:tahW\n:tahW\n:emiT\n:emiT\nyadnoM\n:erehW\n:erehW\n:tahW\n:tahW\n:emiT\n:emiT\nyadseuT\n:erehW\n:erehW\n:tahW\n:tahW\n:emiT\n:emiT\nyadsendeW\n:erehW\n:erehW\n:tahW\n:tahW\n:emiT\n:emiT\nyadsruhT\n:erehW\n:erehW\n:tahW\n:tahW\n:emiT\n:emiT\nyadirF\n:erehW\n:erehW\n:tahW\n:tahW\n:emiT\n:emiT\nyadrutaS\n:erehW\n:erehW\n:tahW\n:tahW\n:emiT\n:emiT\nyadnuS\n:erehW\n:erehW\n[Page 122]\n\u000e Sleepiness means just that\u2014feeling sleepy, heavy, and dull. It is important to note\nthat the causes of sleepiness can include physical fatigue, but, also, a second kind\nof sleepiness is actually a resistance to something happening in mind and body\nthat may be frightening or painful. Learning to distinguish between these two is\nvery helpful.\n\u000e Restlessness is the opposite of sleepy. It can be very uncomfortable. It is a \u201cstorm\u201d\nof thoughts, feelings, and sensations that demand movement and are quite\ndistracting.\n\u000e Doubt is that inner voice that says, \u201cI can\u2019t handle this. I don\u2019t know how to do it.\nWhat good is this? This definitely is not for me.\u201d Doubt is often expressed as words\nin your mind and feelings of fear and resistance to what is happening.\nworking wisely with the Hindrances\nThe first and most potent way to handle any of the hindrances is to make the experience of\nthe hindrance itself a focus for your mindfulness. Acknowledge what is happening without fighting\nit. Gently place attention on desire, aversion, sleepiness, restlessness, or doubt, and look deeply,\nallowing the energy to reveal itself in all of its forms. Patiently return your soft and curious attention time and again, as often as necessary, to the hindrance energy, naming it and learning what\nit has to teach you. The lessons can come in many ways, including thoughts, memories, feelings,\nand body sensations.\nIn addition, you may find benefits in the following specific suggestions for each hindrance:\n\u000e For desire, recall that no matter how many times you get what you desire, you always\nwant more. Let this wisdom empower you to resist the temptation of desire and\nlearn from it instead. Keep noticing and naming desire without acting on it.\n\u000e For aversion, recognize anger and ill will as some of your strongest teachers. Resolve\nto learn from them. At times, it also helps if you can work to balance them by\ndeveloping thoughts of compassion, kindness, and forgiveness.\n\u000e For sleepiness, know it as a powerful condition that demands your full attention. It can\nhelp to sit up straight, even stand. Splash water on your face. Take a break and do\nsomething active, walking mindfully, for example.\n\u000e For restlessness, besides making it the object of mindfulness, it can be very helpful to\nsharpen your concentration. Take a more narrow or smaller focus, for example,\nplacing attention at the tip of your nose for practicing mindful breathing, or relaxing and counting your breaths from one to ten and back to one until the restlessness subsides.\nAdvanced Mindfulness Skills 113\n[Page 123]\n\u000e For doubt, especially when your mind is racing everywhere, it can help to concentrate\nattention in the present moment with some resolve and steadiness. Other remedies for\ndoubt can be conversation with mindfulness teachers and others who follow this\npath, and inspirational readings related to how others handle doubt.\nFinally, remember to take a kind and interested nonjudging attitude toward the hindrances\nwhen they appear. When you can treat them as teachers, not obstacles, they will cease to be\nhindrances!\n114 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 124]\nchapter 5\nExploring Mindfulness Further\nMINDFuLNESS AND MEDITATION\nThe mindfulness skills that are at the core of the dialectical behavior therapy approach are actually\nlinked directly to a much larger and more ancient tradition of meditation. In that larger tradition\nis a significant body of experience and wisdom related to developing and practicing mindfulness.\nThis experience and wisdom has much to offer anyone interested in mindfulness, whether they\nseek improved psychological or physical health, personal enrichment, or even spiritual growth.\nThis chapter invites you to explore mindfulness further by trying some additional practices\nadapted from the ancient tradition of meditation and now appearing in many clinical settings that\nteach mindfulness-based approaches for a variety of health-related conditions.\nThe intention and hope is that you will develop an even deeper appreciation for the power\nof mindfulness to support you, promote your happiness, and lead you increasingly to rest in wise\nmind.\nMarsha Linehan, who developed dialectical behavior therapy, has noted this larger context\nfor mindfulness in commenting that the mindfulness skills central to dialectical behavior therapy\nare \u201cpsychological and behavioral versions of meditation practices from Eastern spiritual training.\u201d Linehan goes on to say that in developing dialectical behavior therapy, \u201cI have drawn most\nheavily from the practice of Zen, but the skills are compatible with most Western contemplative\nand Eastern meditation practices\u201d (Linehan, 1993b, p. 63).\nIn the past twenty-five years or so, many health care professionals have become interested\nin mindfulness and its applications in treating a wide variety of health-related conditions ranging\nfrom stress to chronic pain to anxiety and depression to cancer. In bringing mindfulness forward\nin Western health care settings, the ancient teachings and wisdom of various contemplative and\nmeditative traditions have provided much valuable insight.\n[Page 125]\nAlthough many (like Linehan) have drawn upon these older traditions for guidance, the\nactual practices used for purposes of health and healing do not require adherence to any specific\nfaith or religious beliefs, nor do they carry any specific cultural requirements. The practice of\nmindfulness is truly something for all human beings. The practices you will find in this chapter\nalso apply equally to any interested person.\nFirst, you will learn about the role of \u201cheartful\u201d qualities of kindness and compassion and\nhow they are actually embedded attitudes in any activity of mindfulness.\nNext, you will learn how mindfulness can deepen, breath by breath in the present moment,\nby attention to and the support of the dimensions of spaciousness and stillness.\nKindness, compassion, spaciousness, and stillness\u2014this chapter invites you to bring attention\nmore consciously to these qualities and discover their power to support and deepen your practice\nof mindfulness.\nENHANCING YOuR MINDFuLNESS SKILLS uSING\nKINDNESS AND COMPASSION\nIn dialectical behavior therapy, a core \u201chow\u201d skill is being nonjudgmental. In mindfulness-based\nstress reduction, a mindfulness approach to stress reduction developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn and\nothers, nonjudging is the first of seven attitudes considered to be the foundation of mindfulness\npractice. The others are patience, beginner\u2019s mind, trust, non-striving, acceptance, and letting go (KabatZinn, 1990, p. 33).\nYet you may have noticed that it is not always so easy to be nonjudging. In fact, the habits of\njudging and criticizing are deeply ingrained in nearly everyone, for a wide variety of reasons.\nBecause of this deep-habit energy of judging, meditation teachers have long taught the importance of building a foundation for mindfulness upon attitudes of kindness and compassion.\nFor example, the well-respected meditation teacher Christina Feldman has observed that\n\u201cattention, awareness, understanding, and compassion form the basic skeleton of all systems of\nmeditation.\u201d She goes on to say, \u201cCompassion is a fundamental principle of meditation. Meditation\nis not a narcissistic, self-interested path. It provides the foundation for love, integrity, compassion,\nrespect and sensitivity\u201d (Feldman, 1998, p. 2).\nIn recent years, health psychologists have begun to look more deeply at \u201cpositive\u201d emotions\nand attitudes and their role in promoting health. The rich tradition of positive mental health\ninquiry builds on the work of psychologists Gordon Allport and Abraham Maslow in the 1960s\nand continues strongly today. It is motivated in large part by an interest in developing an expanded\nvision of human capacity and potential. Of particular interest on this theme is that expanded\nhuman potential has been one of the primary goals of meditation training since ancient times.\nContemporary health psychologists and researchers Shauna L. Shapiro and Gary E. R.\nSchwartz have written about the positive aspects of meditation. They point out that mindfulness\nis about how one pays attention. In addition to the seven attitudinal qualities identified by KabatZinn, Shapiro and Schwartz suggest that an additional five qualities be incorporated to address the\n116 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 126]\naffective (or \u201cheart\u201d) dimension of mindfulness. The five \u201cheart\u201d qualities they name are: gratitude,\ngentleness, generosity, empathy, and lovingkindness (Shapiro & Schwartz, 2000, pp. 253\u2013273).\nLovingkindness deserves special mention. It has been popularized by the meditation teacher\nSharon Salzberg (1995; 1997; 2005). As health-care professionals learn more about lovingkindness,\nthis form of meditation is gaining popularity in a variety of health-care settings as a meditation\npractice that supports mindfulness and also carries healing potential of its own.\nLovingkindness is variously described as deep friendliness and welcoming or as a quality\nembodying compassion and cherishing, filled with forgiveness and unconditional love. It is a deep\nhuman capacity, always present, at least potentially. It can be seen when one observes a mother\ntenderly caring for her child.\nLovingkindness can be a powerful aid to your mindfulness practice. All you need to do is to\nadmit and allow feelings of kindness and compassion into your way of paying attention mindfully.\nResting in kindness this way, with compassion and affection embedded in your attention, can protect\nyou from the deep habits of judging and criticism and support you in the \u201chow\u201d dialectical behavior\ntherapy skill of being truly nonjudgmental.\nExercise: Meditation Practice for the Lovingkindness\nof Yourself and Others\nThe following is a brief meditation practice to cultivate lovingkindness for yourself and for others.\nPractice it whenever and for as long as you like. Try it as a \u201clead-in\u201d to any of your formal mindfulness practices.\nInstructions\nTake a comfortable position. Bring your focus mindfully to your breath or body for a few breaths.\nOpen and soften as much as feels safe to you as you allow yourself to connect with your natural inner\nfeelings of kindness and compassion for others.\nNow shift your attention to yourself. It could be a sense of your whole self or some part that needs\ncare and attention, such as a physical injury or the site of an illness or a feeling of emotional pain.\nImagine speaking gently and quietly to yourself, as a mother speaks to her frightened or injured child.\nUse a phrase like \u201cMay I be safe and protected\u201d or \u201cMay I be happy\u201d or \u201cMay I be healthy and well\u201d or\n\u201cMay I live with ease\u201d or make up one of your own. Let the phrase you pick be something anyone would\nwant (safety, ease, joy, and so on). Pick one that works for you. It can be a single phrase. Then put all\nyour heart into it each time you speak to yourself. Let kindness and compassion come through you.\nPractice by repeating your phrase to yourself silently as if singing a lullaby to a baby. Practice for\nas long as you like. It may help to practice for just a few minutes at a time at first and later build up to\na longer practice.\nExploring Mindfulness Further 117\n[Page 127]\nWhen you like, you can shift your attention and focus to a friend or someone you know who\nis troubled. You can also focus on groups of people, such as \u201call my friends\u201d or \u201call my brothers and\nsisters.\u201d\nWhen you wish, you can experiment with difficult people in your life. Try sending them\nkindness and your wish that they might be happy, and watch your inner response. In doing lovingkindness for a difficult person, you are not allowing them to abuse or hurt you but are making\nan attempt to see that they, too, are human beings who seek happiness. This can change your\nrelationship to the situation and release you from resentment you may be holding.\nPlease note that in doing lovingkindness meditation, you are likely to experience many\ndifferent feelings! Some may even be disturbing, such as sadness, grief, or anger. If this happens,\nyou have not made a mistake. It is common for deeply held feelings to be released as one practices\nlovingkindness. This release is actually a kind of healing in itself. Just pay attention to all of your\nfeelings, honoring each one, and continue your practice.\nATTENTION TO SPACIOuSNESS AND STILLNESS\nDEEPENS MINDFuLNESS\nThe core dialectical behavior therapy skill of mindfulness includes the \u201cwhat\u201d skill of observing\nand the \u201chow\u201d skill of nonjudging. But old habits of attention can often make it difficult to observe\nfully or to really be nonjudging. When it seems especially difficult to be mindful, observe closely, or\nbe nonjudging, you simply may not be relaxing enough or resting in your wholeness. Instead, you\nare very likely overly identified with some active and present smaller part or parts of yourself.\nMeditation teachers often use the metaphor of an ocean when illustrating your wholeness\ncompared to identification with a smaller part of yourself (your thoughts and judgments or your\nfeelings of anger or fear, for example). In this metaphor, it is noted that the waves and the ocean are\nnot separate. Although the waves are varied and can be intense and dramatic, they still are made\nof water and are part of the greater ocean, even down to the deepest depths. It is said that your\nwholeness (sometimes called big mind or some similar term) is like the ocean, while the parts (feelings, thoughts, stories in your mind) are like the waves\u2014constantly rising and falling, appearing\nand disappearing, while their essence, the ocean, is always present.\nThe tendency to identify with the wave and to lose your feeling of connection with the larger\nocean of who you are is very strong. Practicing mindfulness, learning to recognize the reasoning\nmind and the emotional mind when they arise, can offer freedom from rigid identification with\nyour smaller parts, as you have discovered.\nAnd by shifting your focus at times, on purpose, to experiences often not noticed or taken\nfor granted, you can become much more flexible in your attention, more mindful, and more able\nto break the habitual identification with old habits of thinking and feeling.\n118 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 128]\nChoosing space and stillness (or silence) as your objects of mindfulness can be a very potent\npractice for gaining this flexibility and freedom from the habits of identifying with the \u201cwaves\u201d of\nyour mind (thoughts or feelings that are deep and intense).\nExercise: Meditation Practice for Mindfulness of Space, Inside\nand Outside of You\nThe following two meditation practices offer you a means to cultivate awareness of space (inner\nand outer) and of stillness and silence.\nTry these practices with a sense of curiosity and playfulness. You don\u2019t have to make anything\nspecial happen or become anyone or anything other than who you already are!\nIn fact, it is helpful to consider the possibility that you actually already have vast spaciousness\nand stillness available to you (like the vast ocean depths) and all that is required is to allow space and\nstillness to reenter your awareness. Let the spaciousness and stillness within you \u201ccome back in,\u201d so\nto speak. There is no work you have to do\u2014none whatsoever! Just bring kind attention to what\nis already here.\nInstructions\nTake a comfortable position. Collect attention by focusing mindfully on your breath sensations for\na few breaths.\nWhen you feel steady and focused, widen the focus to include all sounds, letting them come to you\nwithout adding or subtracting anything. Focus on the direct experience of sound without being caught in\nthe name or story about any sound.\nPractice mindfulness of breath sensations and sounds for a few more breaths.\nNow bring your attention to the spaces between the breaths, there between in-breath and out-breath,\nand there, at the end of the out-breath before the next in-breath. Let your attention rest there, in the\nspaces between each breath. Come back to the space whenever your attention wanders.\nWhen you notice that sounds draw your attention, first notice the sound, then notice the spaces\nbetween the sounds. Notice how one sound is louder, another softer, one closer, one farther, and how all\nhave space between and around them. Notice how all the sounds exist within a larger container of space.\nLet your attention rest in the space that holds all the sounds, allowing them to come and go.\nWhen you wish, open your eyes. Look around at what is before you. What do you see? Objects,\nof course, but do you see the space between the objects? Look more closely. See the space and the shape\nof the space between objects near and far. Can you see the vast space that holds all the objects you are\nviewing? Relax and look deeply.\nWhenever you like, practice noticing space, either as a formal meditation practice (as suggested above with breath sensations, sounds, or viewed objects) or more informally, just paying\nattention in different situations as you go about your day.\nExploring Mindfulness Further 119\n[Page 129]\nYou may even want to experiment with noticing the space that contains your thoughts and\nfeelings. Can you relax, observe, and allow thoughts and feelings to arise, change, and leave the\nspace of the present moment?\nExercise: Meditation Practice to Turn Toward Stillness and Silence\nInstructions\nTake a comfortable position. Establish and steady your attention in the present moment by focusing\nmindfully on your breath sensations for a few breaths.\nWhen you notice that your attention moves to something else, thoughts or sounds for example,\nyou don\u2019t have to fight that and you don\u2019t have to follow it. Just let the breath sensations return to your\nawareness, with patience and kindness.\nAs you practice mindfulness of your breath, you may begin to notice that a sense of inner stillness\narises. It may appear only in brief flashes at first, but don\u2019t be discouraged. Just let it come. Continue\nnoticing any feelings of stillness you experience. Relax in them, and allow them to come to you. Initially,\nyou may notice the stillness in your body as a feeling of calm and ease. Then, it will become easier to\nexperience the stillness in your mind when your thoughts quiet down.\nSometimes the stillness appears more clearly as silence. When you notice any sense of silence,\nbetween sounds or between thoughts, for instance, let your attention rest there. Let it return there when\nit wanders.\nListen carefully to all sounds as they come and go. Don\u2019t focus on any one sound, but instead focus\non the silence and space between the sounds. As your attention steadies, notice how the sounds arise from\nsilence and return to silence. Let your attention rest in the silence as you listen for the next sound.\nCONCLuSION\nIn practicing mindfulness, you are joining a vast and ancient tradition, cultivated by countless\nhuman beings for thousands of years. Many teachers have pointed out that practicing mindfulness\nincludes the attitudes of kindness and compassion in the way you pay attention. As you become\nmore mindful, a growing sense of wholeness, including spaciousness and stillness, becomes brighter\nand can help transform your experience of living. This chapter invites you to draw upon some\nvaluable teachings from the tradition of mindfulness meditation\u2014by focusing on kindness and\ncompassion and spaciousness and stillness\u2014in order to discover more about your own amazing\nand powerful resources for healing and enriching your life.\n120 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 130]\nchapter 6\nBasic Emotion Regulation Skills\nYOuR EMOTIONS: WHAT ARE THEY?\nTo put it simply, emotions are signals within your body that tell you what\u2019s happening. When\nsomething pleasurable is happening to you, you feel good; when something distressing is happening\nto you, you feel bad. In many ways, your emotions are like an instant news service that gives you\nconstant updates about what you\u2019re doing and what you\u2019re experiencing.\nYour initial reactions to what is happening to you are called primary emotions. These are\nstrong feelings that come on quickly, that don\u2019t involve having to think about what\u2019s happening.\nFor example, if you won a contest, you might instantaneously feel surprised. When someone you\ncare about dies, you quickly feel sad. When someone does something that offends you, you might\nimmediately feel angry.\nBut in addition to experiencing primary emotions, it\u2019s also possible to experience secondary emotions. These are emotional reactions to your primary emotions. Or to put it another way,\nsecondary emotions are feelings about your feelings (Marra, 2005). Here\u2019s a simple example. Erik\nyelled at his sister because she did something that made him feel angry. His feeling of anger came\non very quickly. But a little later he felt guilty about getting so angry with her. Anger was his\nprimary emotion, and guilt was his secondary emotion.\nHowever, it\u2019s also possible that you can experience numerous secondary emotions in response\nto a single primary emotion. Here\u2019s a more complicated example. Shauna became anxious when\nshe was asked to make a future presentation at work. As the day drew closer, she became depressed\nas she thought about how anxious she was getting, and then she started to feel worthless that she\ncouldn\u2019t make a simple presentation. Then, the day after the presentation, she started to feel guilty\nthat she had made such a big deal about it in the first place. You can see how a person\u2019s emotions\ncan get very complicated very quickly. Anxiety was Shauna\u2019s primary emotion, and depression,\nworthlessness, and guilt were all her secondary emotions in response to her anxiety.\n[Page 131]\nIt\u2019s possible that your primary emotional reaction to a situation can set off a limitless chain\nreaction of distressing secondary emotions that cause you much more pain than your original\nemotion does. For this reason, it\u2019s important that you try to identify what your original primary\nemotion is in a distressing situation so that you can learn to cope with that feeling before the\navalanche of secondary emotions overwhelms you. This is where emotion regulation skills can be\nhelpful. Emotion regulation skills are an important part of dialectical behavior therapy because\nthey will help you cope with your distressing primary and secondary feelings in new and healthier\nways (Dodge, 1989; Linehan, 1993a).\nThese skills are especially useful, because without them, people often choose to deal with\ntheir primary and secondary emotions in ways that only cause them more suffering. In Shauna\u2019s\nexample, it\u2019s easy to imagine that she could have chosen to use alcohol or drugs to deal with her\nfeelings of anxiety, cutting or self-mutilation to deal with her feelings of depression, and binge\neating to deal with her feelings of guilt. These are all harmful coping strategies that are often used\nby people with overwhelming emotions. For this reason, it\u2019s extremely important that you learn the\nemotion regulation skills in this workbook so that you can cope with your primary and secondary\nemotions in healthier ways and avoid the prolonged suffering that often accompanies them.\nEmotion regulation skills are also important for dealing with another problem called ambivalence. Ambivalence occurs when you have more than one emotional reaction to the same event and\neach emotion pulls you in a different direction or makes you want to do something different. For\nexample, Tina had grown up without her father in her life. Then one day when she was twenty-five,\nher father contacted her and wanted to see her. Tina felt excited about the opportunity of forming\na new relationship with him, but she was equally angry with him for abandoning her family. Clearly\nTina\u2019s emotions were split, and they pulled her in two different directions about what to do.\nIf you\u2019ve been dealing with overwhelming emotions for a long time, it\u2019s easy to understand\nthat you might feel frustrated and hopeless about controlling your emotional reactions. But remember: although it might be difficult to control your primary emotional reaction, there\u2019s still hope\nthat you can learn to control your secondary emotional responses as well as how you choose to\ncope with your emotions. And it could be that later on, when you start using all the skills in this\nworkbook, especially the mindfulness skills, you might even gain some control over your primary\nemotional responses too.\nHOW DO EMOTIONS WORK?\nEmotions are electrical and chemical signals in your body that alert you to what is happening.\nThese signals often begin with your senses of sight, touch, hearing, smell, and taste. Then the\nsignals travel to your brain, where they are processed in an area called the limbic system, which\nspecializes in observing and processing emotions so that you can respond to emotional situations.\nThe limbic system is also connected to the rest of your brain and body so that it can tell your body\nwhat to do in response to an emotional situation.\nYour emotions are extremely important for many reasons, especially your survival. Here\u2019s an\nexample. Louise was walking down Main Street when suddenly a very large and angry dog began\n122 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 132]\nbarking viciously and running toward her. In that instant, an emotional signal was sent from\nher eyes and ears to her brain. Her limbic system then processed the information without Louise\nhaving to think about what to do. This type of response is called fight or flight, and it determined\nif Louise was going to stay to fight the dog or run away. Wisely, she chose to run away, and she\nescaped without being harmed. Her emotions helped her survive and avoid any pain.\nNow let\u2019s suppose that two weeks later she was once again walking through town when she\nstarted to turn down Main Street. Very quickly, she began to feel afraid. This is called a conditioned\nresponse. Louise\u2019s limbic system was trying to protect her by helping her remember the dangerous\ndog on Main Street. Sensibly, she chose to walk down a different street to avoid the dog. In this\nexample, Louise\u2019s emotions initially helped her escape danger and pain, and later, they also helped\nher avoid potential harm.\nHere\u2019s another example of how emotions work. Sheila was walking through town when she\nsuddenly saw Courtney, a good friend from many years before. Immediately, Sheila felt happy.\nWhen Courtney saw Sheila, she smiled right away. Sheila noticed her smile and thought, \u201cShe\nmust be happy to see me too.\u201d So Sheila smiled as well. The two women quickly reconnected and\nmade plans to do something together in the near future. The encounter made both women feel\nhappy that they\u2019d met accidentally after so many years.\nIn this example, the smile was an act of communication for both women. It helped each\nperson recognize how the other person was feeling. If Courtney had frowned and looked the other\nway when she saw Sheila, Sheila would have recognized the expression as one of disgust and would\nprobably have avoided contact with her. Every person, no matter what their culture, has the ability\nto express emotions in the same way and to recognize emotional expressions in other people. A\nsmile is a smile no matter where you were born.\nThese are just two very simple examples, but you can see that emotions serve many purposes.\nEmotions are signals that help you to do the following:\n\u000e Survive (\u201cfight or flight\u201d).\n\u000e Remember people and situations.\n\u000e Cope with situations in your daily life.\n\u000e Communicate with others.\n\u000e Avoid pain.\n\u000e Seek pleasure.\nWHAT ARE EMOTION REGuLATION SKILLS?\nAs you\u2019ve already learned, emotion regulation skills will help you cope with your reactions to your\nprimary and secondary emotions in new and more effective ways. (Remember, you can\u2019t always\ncontrol what you feel, but you can control how you react to those feelings.) These are some of the\nBasic Emotion Regulation Skills 123\n[Page 133]\nmost important techniques to learn in dialectical behavior therapy, so you might not be surprised\nthat you\u2019ve already been practicing some of them in the chapters on distress tolerance and mindfulness skills. The four skill groups in dialectical behavior therapy (distress tolerance, mindfulness,\nemotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness) overlap and reinforce each other because this\nhelps you learn the skills more easily and to remember them more quickly.\nIn dialectical behavior therapy, there are nine emotion regulation skills that will help you\ngain control of your emotions and the behaviors associated with them (Linehan, 1993b). These\nskills are as follows:\n1 . Recognizing your emotions\n2 . Overcoming the barriers to healthy emotions\n3 . Reducing your physical vulnerability\n4 . Reducing your cognitive vulnerability\n5 . Increasing your positive emotions\n6 . Being mindful of your emotions without judgment\n7 . Emotion exposure\n8 . Doing the opposite of your emotional urges\n9 . Problem solving\nThis chapter will cover the first five emotion regulation skills, and the next chapter will cover\nthe last four skills. As in the previous chapters, the exercises in these two chapters will build on\neach other, so make sure that you do the exercises in order.\nRECOGNIzING YOuR EMOTIONS\nLearning how to recognize your emotions and their effect on your life is the first step to controlling\nyour high-intensity emotional reactions. Very often, people spend their lives paying little attention\nto how they feel. As a result, there are a lot of important things happening inside them that they\nknow little about. The same holds true for people struggling with overwhelming emotions, but it\noccurs in a different way. Very often, people struggling with this problem recognize the tidal wave\nof distressing emotions that overcomes them (such as sadness, anger, guilt, shame, and so on), but\nby the time they recognize the tidal wave, it\u2019s too late to do anything about it.\nTo control your overwhelming emotional reactions, it\u2019s first necessary to slow down the emotional process so that it can be examined. And then, after it\u2019s examined, you can make healthier\ndecisions. This exercise will help you begin this process by examining an emotional situation that\nhas already occurred in the past. It will require you to be as honest with yourself as possible. The\n124 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 134]\npurpose of this exercise is to discover what emotions you were feeling (both primary and secondary\nemotions) and then figure out how those emotions affected your actions and feelings later on.\nLet\u2019s consider an example. Ling struggled with overwhelming emotions that often got out of\ncontrol. One evening, she came home from work and found her husband drunk on the sofa again.\nHe refused to go to psychotherapy and he didn\u2019t consider himself an alcoholic, so he wouldn\u2019t go\nto a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. Ling immediately felt angry, so she started screaming at\nher husband, calling him a \u201cworthless drunk.\u201d But he just lay there without arguing or moving. She\nwanted to hit him, but she didn\u2019t. After a few minutes, Ling started to feel hopeless and ashamed\ntoo. She had tried everything to help her husband, but nothing seemed to work. She didn\u2019t feel like\nshe could stay in her marriage any longer, but she also didn\u2019t believe in divorce. Ling went to the\nbathroom and locked herself in. She thought about killing herself, to end the pain she was feeling.\nBut instead, she took out a razor and started cutting herself on her leg just enough to make herself\nbleed. That night she forgot to set her alarm because she was too upset, so she missed the first few\nhours of work and got reprimanded by her manager.\nLing\u2019s story is common for many people. Using this story, let\u2019s follow the six-step process that\nwill help you recognize your emotions (Linehan, 1993b).\n1 . What happened? This is your opportunity to describe the situation that led to your emotions. In this example, Ling comes home and once again finds her husband drunk. He\nrefuses to get help or to talk about his problem.\n2 . Why do you think that situation happened? This is an opportunity for you to identify the\npotential causes of your situation. This is a very important step because the meaning\nthat you give to the event will often determine what your emotional reaction is to that\nevent. For example, if you think someone hurt you on purpose, you will react very differently than if you think someone hurt you by accident. Here, Ling believes that her\nhusband is an alcoholic who hates her and regrets marrying her in the first place, so he\nhas just given up on his life to hurt her.\n3 . How did the situation make you feel, both emotionally and physically? Try to identify both\nprimary and secondary emotions if you can. Learning how to identify your emotions will\ntake practice, but it will be worth the effort that you make. If you need help finding\nwords to describe how you feel, see the List of Commonly Felt Emotions in chapter 3.\nAlso, try to identify how you were feeling physically. Emotions and physical sensations,\nespecially muscle tension, are strongly related. In this example, Ling\u2019s primary emotion\nis anger (after seeing her husband drunk), and then she feels the secondary emotions\nof hopelessness and shame. Physically, she notices that all the muscles in her face and\narms become very tense, and she feels sick to her stomach.\n4 . What did you want to do as a result of how you felt? This question is very important\nbecause it identifies your urges. Often, when a person is overwhelmed with emotions, he\nor she has the urge to say or do something that is drastic, painful, or extremely dangerous. However, the person doesn\u2019t always do these things; sometimes the urges are just\nthoughts and impulses. When you start to notice what you want to do and compare it\nBasic Emotion Regulation Skills 125\n[Page 135]\nwith what you actually do, the results can be cause for hope. If you can control some\nurges, chances are good that you can control other urges too. In this example, Ling had\nthe urge to do two things that would have been very dangerous and deadly: hit her\nhusband and kill herself to end her pain. Thankfully, she didn\u2019t do either one, which\nlater gave her hope that she could control other urges as well.\n5 . What did you do and say? This is where you identify what you actually did as a result\nof your emotions. In this example, Ling locks herself in her bathroom and begins to\nmutilate herself. She also yells at her husband and calls him a \u201cworthless drunk.\u201d\n6 . How did your emotions and actions affect you later? Here you can identify the longer-term\nconsequences of what you felt and did. In Ling\u2019s example, she oversleeps for work the\nnext morning since she forgets to set her alarm, and she is disciplined by her boss, which\nputs her job at risk.\nExercise: Recognizing Your Emotions\nOn the next page is an example of the Recognizing Your Emotions Worksheet with Ling\u2019s experience filled in. On the following page, there\u2019s a blank worksheet for you to fill in an example from\nyour own life. Before you use the blank worksheet, make photocopies of it so that you can continue\nto use it in the future. Or simply write the headings on a clean sheet of paper to make your own\nworksheet.\nFor now, use the worksheet to examine an emotional incident from your recent past. Pick\na situation that you can clearly remember. Do your best to identify your primary and secondary\nemotions. And remember, be as honest as you can with yourself. No one has to see this worksheet\nexcept for you.\nThen, for at least the next two weeks, pick a situation that happens to you each day and\nexamine it using the Recognizing Your Emotions Worksheet. Remember, you need to practice\nexamining past situations so that you can later learn how to identify your emotions and their\nconsequences while they are happening.\n126 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 136]\nBasic Emotion Regulation Skills 127\nTEEHSKROW\nSNOITOME\nRuOY\nGNIzINGOCER\n:ELPMAxE\nsesnopseR\nruoY\nsnoitseuQ\n.thgin\ntsaL\n?neppah\nnoitautis\neht\ndid\nnehW\n.niaga\nknurd\nafos\neht\nno\ngniyl\nsaw\ndnabsuh\nym dna\nemoh\nemac\nI\n?deneppah\ntahW\ndellac\ndna\nmih\nta\ndelley\nI .AA\nro\nypareht\not og ot\nsesufer\nllits\neH\n).tneve\neht\nebircseD(\ngniyas\ntuohtiw\n,ereht\ntas\ntsuj\neh\ntuB\n\u201d.knurd\nsselhtrow\u201c\na\nmih\n.flesym\ntuc\ndna\nmoorhtab\neht\nni tnew\nI oS\n.gnihtyna\ngniyrram\nsterger\ndna\nem\nsetah\nohw\ncilohocla\nna\nsi dnabsuh\nyM\n?deneppah\nnoitautis\ntaht\nkniht\nuoy\nod\nyhW\nsgniht\nseod\ntsuj\ndna\nefil\nnwo\nsih\nno\npu\nnevig\ns\u2019eh\nkniht osla\nI\n.em\n).sesuac\neht\nyfitnedI(\n.esoprup\nno em\ntruh ot\nsiht\nekil\nregnA\n:snoitome\nyramirP\ndna\nyllanoitome\nhtob\n,leef\nuoy\nekam\nnoitautis\ntaht\ndid\nwoH\nemahs\ndna\nssensselepoH\n:snoitome\nyradnoceS\n?yllacisyhp\nym\not\nkcis\n,esnet\nemaceb\nsmra\ndna\necaF\n:snoitasnes\nlacisyhP\nyradnoces\neht\ndna\nyramirp\neht\nhtob\nyfitnedi\not yrT(\nhcamots\n).snoitome\not\nflesym\nllik\not\negru\neht\ndah\nI\ndna\n,dnabsuh\nym\ntih ot\ndetnaw\nI\n?tlef\nuoy\nwoh\nfo\ntluser\na\nsa\nod\not\ntnaw\nuoy\ndid\ntahW\n.niap\nym\ndne\n)?segru\nruoy\nerew\ntahW(\n.flesym\ngnittuc\ndetrats\ndna\nmoorhtab\neht ni\nflesym\ndekcol\nI\n?yas\ndna\nod\nuoy\ndid\ntahW\n.yrgna\nos\nsaw\nI\nesuaceb\nflesym\nyb deb\not tnew\nI\nnehT\nfo\ntluser\na\nsa\nni\negagne\nuoy\ndid\nsroivaheb\nro\nsnoitca\ntahW(\n\u201d.knurd\nsselhtrow\u201c\na\nmih\ndellac\ndna\ndnabsuh\nym ta\ndelley\nI\n)?tlef\nuoy\nwoh\n.mrala\nym\ntes\not\ntogrof\nI taht\ndeb\not\ntnew\nI nehw\nyrgna\nos\nsaw\nI\n?retal\nuoy\ntceffa\nsnoitca\ndna\nsnoitome\nruoy\ndid\nwoH\nem\nta\ndelley\nssob\nym\n,ni\ntog\nI nehW\n.krow\nrof etal\npu ekow\nI oS\na\nsa\nereht\nerew\nsecneuqesnoc\nmret-gnol\nro\nmret-trohs\ntahW(\nerif\not\nevah\nll\u2019eh\n,emit\nerom\neno\netal\nm\u2019I\nfi taht\ndias eH\n.niaga\n)?snoitca\nruoy\nfo\ntluser\n.em\n[Page 137]\n128 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\nTEEHSKROW\nSNOITOME\nRuOY\nGNIzINGOCER\nsesnopseR\nruoY\nsnoitseuQ\n?neppah\nnoitautis\neht\ndid\nnehW\n?deneppah\ntahW\n).tneve\neht\nebircseD(\n?deneppah\nnoitautis\ntaht\nkniht\nuoy\nod\nyhW\n).sesuac\neht\nyfitnedI(\n:snoitome\nyramirP\ndna\nyllanoitome\nhtob\n,leef\nuoy\nekam\nnoitautis\ntaht\ndid\nwoH\n:snoitome\nyradnoceS\n?yllacisyhp\n:snoitasnes\nlacisyhP\nyradnoces\neht\ndna\nyramirp\neht\nhtob\nyfitnedi\not yrT(\n).snoitome\n?tlef\nuoy\nwoh\nfo\ntluser\na\nsa\nod\not\ntnaw\nuoy\ndid\ntahW\n)?segru\nruoy\nerew\ntahW(\n?yas\ndna\nod\nuoy\ndid\ntahW\nfo\ntluser\na\nsa\nni\negagne\nuoy\ndid\nsroivaheb\nro\nsnoitca\ntahW(\n)?tlef\nuoy\nwoh\n?retal\nuoy\ntceffa\nsnoitca\ndna\nsnoitome\nruoy\ndid\nwoH\na\nsa\nereht\nerew\nsecneuqesnoc\nmret-gnol\nro\nmret-trohs\ntahW(\n)?snoitca\nruoy\nfo\ntluser\n[Page 138]\nExercise: Emotional Record\nTo help you recognize your emotions, it\u2019s often helpful to say how you\u2019re feeling out loud. This\nmethod of labeling might sound silly at first, but the act of saying how you feel out loud will\nhighlight your emotions for you and help you pay extra attention to what you\u2019re experiencing.\nDescribing your emotions aloud, especially your overwhelming emotions, can also help deflate your\ndistressing feelings. So the more you can talk about an emotion, the less urge you might have to\ndo something about it. You do not have to scream how you feel; it might be enough to say your\nemotion quietly to yourself. Just find what works best for you. Say to yourself: \u201cRight now I feel \u2026\u201d\nIf you need a reminder of how you might be feeling, refer to the List of Commonly Felt Emotions\nin chapter 3. And remember to pay attention to your pleasant and joyful emotions too. The more\nyou\u2019re able to recognize them and say them out loud, the more fully you\u2019ll be able to enjoy those\nfeelings.\nThen, in order to further reinforce the experience, record your emotions in your Emotional\nRecord. Recording your feelings throughout the week will help you recognize, label, and describe\nyour emotions. On page 131 is an Emotional Record that you can photocopy and keep with you\nin order to record your emotions shortly after you recognize them. Do this exercise for at least two\nweeks. Use the example of the Emotional Record to help you make a note of how you felt, whether\nor not you described your emotion out loud, and what you did in response to your emotion.\nBasic Emotion Regulation Skills 129\n[Page 139]\n130 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\nDROCER\nLANOITOME\n:ELPMAxE\nretfA\noD\nuoY\ndiD\ntahW\ntleF\nuoY\nwoH\nyaS\nuoY\ndiD\n?leeF\nuoY\ndiD\nwoH\ndna\nneppaH\ntI\ndiD\nnehW\nuoY\nwoH\ndezingoceR\nuoY\n?duoL\ntuO\n)\u201d\u2026\nleef\nI\n,won\nthgiR\u201c(\n?uoY\nereW\nerehW\n?tleF\ndah\ndna\nnehctik\neht\not\ntnew\nI\nseY\n.yrgna\nleef\nI\nemoh\nta\n,thgin\nyadsruhT\n.eniw\nfo\nssalg\na\ntpek I\ntub\n,peels\not\nog\not\ndeirt\nI\noN\n.das\nleef\nI\n,thgin\nyadsruhT\n.saw\nI das\nwoh\ntuoba\ngnikniht\nemoh\nta\n-sid\nyb\nnwod\nmlac\not\ndeirt\nI\nseY\n.detatiga\nleef\nI\n,gninrom\nyadirF\neht gnidaer\ndna\nflesym\ngnitcart\nsub\neht\nno\n.repapswen\na dah\ndna\nedistuo\ntnew\nI\nseY\n.ffo\ndessip\nleef\nI\n,gninrom\nyadirF\n.etteragic\nkrow\nta\ndneirf\nym\nerongi\not\ndeunitnoc\nI\noN\n.suolaej\nleef\nI\n,noonretfa\nyadirF\nI taht\nnamow\na\ngnitad\ns\u2019ohw\nkrow\nta\n.ekil\nseivom\neht\not\nog\not\ndediced\nI\nseY\n.ylenol\nleef\nI\n,thgin\nyadirF\ndoog\na evah\ndna\nflesym\nyb\nemoh\nta\n.emit\nym\nhtiw\nkrap\neht\nta\ndeyats\nI\nseY\n.yppah\nleef\nI\n,noonretfa\nyadrutaS\n.sdneirf\nkrap\neht\nta\nenoyna\not\nhcum\nyas\nt\u2019ndid\nI\nseY\n.lufreehc\nleef\nI\nesuoh\ns\u2019neB\nta\n,thgin\nyadrutaS\nssem\not\ntnaw\nt\u2019ndid\nI\nesuaceb\n.sgnileef\nym\npu\n[Page 140]\nBasic Emotion Regulation Skills 131\nDROCER\nLANOITOME\nretfA\noD\nuoY\ndiD\ntahW\ntleF\nuoY\nwoH\nyaS\nuoY\ndiD\n?leeF\nuoY\ndiD\nwoH\ndna\nneppaH\ntI\ndiD\nnehW\nuoY\nwoH\ndezingoceR\nuoY\n?duoL\ntuO\n)\u201d\u2026\nleef\nI\n,won\nthgiR\u201c(\n?uoY\nereW\nerehW\n?tleF\n[Page 141]\nOvERCOMING THE BARRIERS TO HEALTHY EMOTIONS\nNow that you\u2019ve started to recognize your emotions more fully, hopefully you\u2019re also noticing how\nyour emotions can influence your behaviors and thoughts. Please look carefully at the following\ndiagram.\nEmotions\nThoughts Behaviors\nThis diagram depicts how your emotions can influence your thoughts and behaviors and also how\nyour emotions can be affected by your thoughts and behaviors. For example, Jim lost his favorite\nwatch (a behavior). He felt sad (an emotion), and then he thought to himself, \u201cI\u2019m so absentminded;\nI\u2019m an idiot\u201d (a thought). But this thought just made him feel more depressed (an emotion), so he\nwent home and got drunk (a behavior) and later felt ashamed (an emotion). Do you see how your\nemotions can be both the result and the cause of your thoughts and behaviors?\nThis can become a vicious cycle for your emotions if you get caught in self-destructive behaviors or self-critical thinking. But this cycle can also lead to more fulfilling emotional experiences if\nyou engage in healthy behaviors and self-affirming thoughts. For example, maybe after Jim lost his\nwatch (a behavior) and felt sad (an emotion), he could have used a coping thought like \u201cMistakes\nhappen; nobody\u2019s perfect.\u201d Then he might have been able to forgive himself for his mistake (another\nthought) and continue his day, feeling at ease (an emotion). Or after feeling sad about losing his\nwatch, maybe he could have gone for a long walk (a behavior), which would have made him feel\nrefreshed (an emotion). There were many coping thoughts and behaviors Jim could have used to\nprevent getting caught in a cycle of distressing emotions.\nEMOTIONS AND YOuR BEHAvIORS\nClearly, your emotions and your behaviors are strongly linked, and, not surprisingly, stronger emotions often lead to bigger behavioral reactions. As a result, many people with overwhelming feelings\nalso struggle with out-of-control behaviors. People with overwhelming emotions often do many selfdestructive things when they feel angry, depressed, or anxious. They cut or mutilate themselves,\nmanipulate others (which often leads to fights and destructive relationships), overeat, undereat,\ndrink alcohol excessively, and use street drugs. Obviously, these types of behaviors are harmful to\neveryone who\u2019s involved. Yet people who engage in these behaviors often do them repeatedly. So\nthe question remains: why do people do these types of things? The answer lies in your emotions.\nLet\u2019s start with the basics: many behaviors are repeated because they are rewarded. A person\ngoes to work for the reward of a paycheck. A student goes to school for the reward of a degree.\nPeople play sports for the reward of competing. A musician plays an instrument for the reward of\n132 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 142]\ncreating music. And a gardener plants flowers for the reward of seeing them blossom. All of these\nrewards reinforce these behaviors and make them more likely to be repeated in the future. If you\ndidn\u2019t get a paycheck for going to work, you wouldn\u2019t go anymore. If your teachers told you that\nthere was no chance for you to graduate, you\u2019d probably drop out. And if you only got weeds every\ntime you planted a garden, you\u2019d probably stop doing that too.\nIn the same way, your emotions can serve as rewards that reinforce your behavior. Here\u2019s a\nsimple example of how pleasurable emotions can reinforce a behavior: Phil helped his friend Stefan\nmove into a new apartment (a behavior). Stefan was very grateful, which made Phil feel happy\nabout helping him (an emotion). So the next time Stefan asked for a favor, Phil was happy to help\nhim again (another behavior) because it would make him feel good again (another emotion).\nHowever, emotions can reinforce self-destructive behaviors as well. Consider this example:\nTeresa, who struggled with overwhelming emotions, once said, \u201cIf I feel bad, I want my husband\nto feel bad too.\u201d Logically, this doesn\u2019t make sense, but thoughts, emotions, and behaviors aren\u2019t\nalways logical. As a young girl, Teresa had never been taught how to cope with her distressing\nemotions. When she was in emotional or physical pain, she suffered alone without anyone\u2019s help.\nNo one paid attention to how she felt.\nThen, as an adult, she realized that someone would give her and her pain attention if she\nhurt the other person too, usually by making them feel upset. For example, when Teresa felt upset\nat work, she would go home and pick a fight with her husband about something unimportant (her\nbehavior), and he would feel miserable as well. Then he would finally recognize how Teresa felt\nand talk to her about her feelings (which was her emotional reward). Teresa may not have been\nconsciously aware that she was hurting her husband on purpose, but that didn\u2019t matter. At some\npoint in her life, her thoughts had become automatic: \u201cI feel bad, so I have to make someone else\nfeel bad; then I\u2019ll feel better.\u201d And because her behavior was consistently rewarded with a positive (although illogical) emotional experience\u2014validation from her husband\u2014her behavior was\nreinforced and repeated in the future.\nThe Basics Teresa\u2019s Experience\nEmotion or thought \u201cI feel sad.\u201d\n\uf04b \uf04b\nBehavior She starts a fight with her husband.\n\uf04b \uf04b\nBehavior is rewarded Her husband recognizes how she feels.\n\uf04b \uf04b\nBehavior is repeated There are more fights in the future.\nHowever, the way Teresa coped with her distressing feelings only made her feel better for a\nvery limited amount of time. In the long term, her marriage suffered at the expense of her emotional validation. Teresa and her husband had frequent fights as a result of her behaviors, and these\nfights always made her feel even worse.\nBasic Emotion Regulation Skills 133\n[Page 143]\nThe emotional rewards that reinforce self-destructive behaviors are important to understand.\nTwo types of self-destructive behaviors that people with overwhelming emotions often engage\nin are cutting/self-mutilation and manipulating others. Both of these behaviors offer short-term\nrewards that make them likely to be repeated, but both types of behaviors are also followed by\nlong-term damage. (In the next section, Reducing Your Physical Vulnerability to Overwhelming\nEmotions, you\u2019ll learn about self-destructive eating and substance-use behaviors too.)\nCutting/Self-mutilation\nMany people who cut, burn, or scar themselves say that their actions make them feel better\nor that their actions relieve some of their pain. To a certain degree, they\u2019re right. Cutting and\nother types of self-mutilation can cause the body to release natural painkillers called endorphins\nthat help heal the wound. These painkillers can make a person feel physically and emotionally\nbetter for a very short amount of time. Yet as temporary as these rewards are, these physical and\nemotional feelings reinforce self-mutilation in the future. But remember, these behaviors can be\ndangerous and possibly lead to death or infection. And while the pain relief is temporary, the scars,\nthe memories, and the guilt that often accompany these actions still remain.\nIf you engage in any cutting or self-mutilating behaviors, identify what those behaviors are in\nthe space below. Then identify what the temporary rewards might be. And finally, identify what\nthe long-term cost and dangers are, due to those behaviors.\nThe cutting and self-mutilating behaviors that I engage in are\nThe temporary rewards for my behaviors are\nThe long-term costs and dangers of my behaviors are\nmanipulating others\nIn the earlier example, you saw why Teresa picked fights with her husband when she was\nfeeling upset. Her actions, though damaging to her marriage, made her feel better for a short\n134 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 144]\namount of time. Her behavior was rewarded with emotional validation, so it was repeated in the\nfuture. But, the frequent fights with her husband made her feel even worse in the long run.\nSimilarly, other forms of manipulation can have short-lived emotional rewards that lead to\nrepetition. When you force someone into doing what you want, maybe you feel satisfied or in\ncontrol. These can all be strong emotional rewards, especially considering that many people with\noverwhelming emotions feel like their own lives are out of control. But, again, even these emotional\nrewards are temporary.\nHere are some examples. Whenever Brandy felt bored she liked to \u201cmess with people,\u201d just to\ngive herself pleasure. Often she would lie to her friends and tell them phony rumors she claimed to\nhave heard about them. Then, when her friends would get upset, Brandy would pretend to comfort\nthem. This made her feel powerful, until her friends discovered the truth and then stopped talking\nto her. Similarly, Jason was very controlling of his girlfriend Patricia. When they would go out for\ndinner, he would order for her, even if she wanted something different. He also wouldn\u2019t let her\nspend time with her friends; he was constantly calling her on her cell phone to see where she was;\nand he told her that if she ever left him, he\u2019d kill himself. Patricia really cared about Jason, and\nshe didn\u2019t want to see him get hurt, but eventually, Jason\u2019s manipulative behaviors wore her out.\nSo, despite his suicidal threats, Patricia broke up with him.\nRemember, no one likes to be manipulated. Eventually, the person who is being manipulated\ngets tired of being controlled and puts up resistance. Then the relationship becomes confrontational and unrewarding and often ends very painfully. This is usually the worst possible result for\na person struggling with overwhelming emotions because he or she is often extremely afraid of\nbeing abandoned by others. In fact, all the manipulative behaviors are usually attempts to cope\nwith this fear of being left alone and to force people to stay with them. But when the relationships\nfail, the fear of being abandoned becomes a reality, and this can set off even more incidents of\nself-destructive behaviors.\nIf you engage in any manipulative behaviors, identify what those behaviors are in the space\nbelow. Then identify what the temporary rewards might be. And finally, identify what the long -\nterm cost and dangers are due to those behaviors.\nThe manipulative behaviors that I engage in are\nThe temporary rewards for my behaviors are\nThe long-term costs and dangers of my behaviors are\nBasic Emotion Regulation Skills 135\n[Page 145]\nREDuCING YOuR PHYSICAL vuLNERABILITY\nTO OvERWHELMING EMOTIONS\nIn addition to recognizing how your thoughts and behaviors can influence your emotions, it\u2019s also\nimportant that you recognize how other health-related issues influence how you feel. Here are\nsome examples.\nfood\nYour body needs the nutrients it gets from food in order to keep functioning properly, just\nas a car depends on gasoline to keep running. As a result, the food you eat affects how you feel\ndirectly, both emotionally and physically.\nDifferent foods can affect the way you feel as can the amount of food you eat. For example,\nfoods with a lot of fat in them, like ice cream and pastries, can temporarily make you feel pleased\nand satisfied. But if you eat too much of them, you might start to feel heavy and sluggish. Over\ntime, if you eat an excessive amount of food with high levels of fat or sugar, you\u2019ll also gain weight.\nThis often makes people feel sad or unhappy about themselves, and it can also lead to health problems like diabetes and heart disease. Other foods with high sugar content, like candy and soda,\ncan quickly make you feel energized. But as the effect wears off, these foods can leave you feeling\nvery tired or even depressed.\nJust as eating too much of certain foods can make you feel ill, eating too little food can also\nmake you feel unhealthy. Getting too few nutrients in your diet can make you feel dizzy or lightheaded since you\u2019re not getting the energy you need to keep functioning.\nIt\u2019s recommended that you eat a moderate amount of a wide variety of healthy foods every\nday, including fruits, vegetables, grains, and proteins. If you are curious about your diet or need help\ncreating a healthy diet, contact a medical professional or a certified dietician for advice. Or visit\na reputable nutrition Web site, such as the site for the United States Department of Agriculture\nat www.mypyramid.gov where you can find recommendations and guidelines for eating a healthy,\nwell-balanced diet.\nIn the space below, record any thoughts you have about how your own eating habits affect\nhow you feel, and then write at least two ways you can improve your eating habits in order to feel\nbetter.\nMy eating habits affect how I feel because\n136 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 146]\nI can improve my eating habits by\n1)\n2)\novereating and Undereating\nAlso, be aware that some people with overwhelming emotions use food in self-destructive\nways, either by drastically overeating or undereating. Sometimes people overeat because the food\nmakes them feel emotionally calm, or even numb, for a short amount of time. And, again, these\nfeelings lead to the person\u2019s behavior being repeated in the future. Equally dangerous is the fact\nthat some people try to control their overeating by engaging in purging activities like vomiting. Frequent purging can lead to a very dangerous eating disorder called bulimia that can have\ndevastating effects on your body.\nDrastic undereating can also make a person feel good for a short amount of time. Undereating\ncan serve as a form of self-control. Many times, people with overwhelming emotions feel like their\nlives are out of their own control, and undereating gives them a sense of power over their lives\nthat makes them feel better. However, this quest for control can be dangerous because excessive\nundereating can lead to anorexia, an extremely unhealthy and potentially life-threatening eating\ndisorder characterized by a person\u2019s drastically reduced weight.\nIf you engage in any overeating or undereating, identify what those behaviors are in the space\nbelow. Then identify what the temporary rewards might be. And finally, identify what the longterm costs and dangers are due to those behaviors.\nThe overeating or undereating behaviors that I engage in are\nThe temporary rewards for my behaviors are\nThe long-term costs and dangers of my behaviors are\nBasic Emotion Regulation Skills 137\n[Page 147]\nDrugs and Alcohol\nLike food, anything else you put in your body will affect how you feel. Alcohol and drugs\noften make a person feel temporarily happy, numb, excited, or just different. Naturally, these feelings can lead to repeated use of these substances, especially after the temporary feelings have worn\noff. However, the excessive use of alcohol, street drugs, or abused prescription drugs can lead to\nmany health complications, addiction problems, legal issues, financial difficulties, and relationship\nproblems.\nFor example, alcohol is a depressant that makes you feel tired, sluggish, and sad. Many people\ndon\u2019t believe this because they say alcohol makes them feel more energized and social. However,\nalcohol actually makes them feel less self-conscious, so they\u2019re more willing to do or say things that\nthey normally wouldn\u2019t. But with enough alcohol in anyone\u2019s body, he or she will start to feel sad\nand tired, and the less you weigh, the quicker the alcohol will start to take effect on your body\nand feelings.\nThe use of street drugs and certain prescription drugs can have similar effects. Certain drugs,\nsuch as cocaine and crack, can initially make a person feel \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cenergized.\u201d But after the\neffects of the drug wear off, the person may also start to feel depressed, anxious, or paranoid. The\nsame is also true of many other street drugs, such as marijuana, methamphetamines, and heroin.\nCertain prescription drugs can also make you feel depressed and anxious, so be sure to check with\nthe medical professional who prescribed them if you\u2019re feeling any distressing side effects.\nNicotine from tobacco products and caffeine are also considered to be drugs, although they\nare legal and very prominent in our society. Nicotine is a stimulant that activates a person\u2019s muscles,\nregardless of the fact that some people say that smoking makes them feel more relaxed. In these\ncases, what the person is actually experiencing is a temporary sense of relief from his or her body,\nwhich has been craving more nicotine. Nicotine is a highly addictive substance that makes people\nwant to smoke more cigarettes, and that craving can make a person feel very irritated until he or\nshe smokes again.\nCaffeine is also a stimulant that is found in coffee, tea, many sodas, sports drinks, and some\npainkillers. If you drink too much caffeine, you will start to feel jittery, shaky, and irritated. You\ncan also become addicted to caffeine, and if you don\u2019t get enough of it in your body after you\u2019re\naddicted, you can become irritated and possibly develop headaches and other physical symptoms.\nWith the regular use of alcohol, street drugs, and many prescription drugs, you may crave\nmore of the substance just to feel the same effect it once gave you or to feel \u201cnormal.\u201d This is\ncalled tolerance. If you notice you are having this experience with any substance, including prescribed drugs, you should speak with a medical professional. You should also speak with a medical\nprofessional if you have a history of alcohol or drug abuse and you want to stop. Withdrawal from\nalcohol and some other drugs can be potentially dangerous.\nIn the space below, identify what the temporary rewards might be for your behavior and\nidentify possible long-term costs and dangers. Then record any thoughts you have about how your\nown alcohol and drug use affects how you feel, and write at least two ways you can improve your\nhabits in order to feel better.\n138 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 148]\nThe alcohol or drug-using behaviors that I engage in are\nThe temporary rewards for my behaviors are\nThe long-term costs and dangers of my behaviors are\nMy alcohol and drug use affects how I feel because\nI can improve my alcohol and drug habits by\n1)\n2)\nPhysical exercise\nThe human body is designed for motion and activity. Because of this, it\u2019s important that\neveryone engage in some amount of regular exercise in order to keep their bodies healthy and\nfunctioning properly. Without exercise, your body won\u2019t burn up the extra energy it stores from the\nfood you eat. As a result, you might start to feel sluggish, you might start to gain weight, and you\nmay even feel a little depressed. It\u2019s recommended that everyone engage in approximately thirty\nminutes of moderate or vigorous exercise most days of the week. This can include walking, jogging,\nswimming, biking, weight training, or any other activity that makes your body work harder than it\nusually does. Regular exercise is especially important to keep your heart healthy.\nEven if your movement is limited or if you\u2019ve never exercised before, there\u2019s always something\nthat you can do that\u2019s within your safety limits. Be sure to check with a medical professional or a\nBasic Emotion Regulation Skills 139\n[Page 149]\nphysical fitness trainer before engaging in any type of strenuous activity, like weight lifting. And\ntalk with your medical professional if you experience any abnormal pain when you exercise.\nIn the space below, record any thoughts you have about how your own exercise habits (or\nlack of exercise) affect how you feel, and then write at least two ways you can improve your habits\nin order to feel better.\nMy exercise habits affect how I feel because\nI can improve my exercise habits by\n1)\n2)\nSleep\nGetting enough sleep is one of the most important things you can do to feel healthy. The\naverage adult needs approximately seven or eight hours of sleep each night. Children and some\nadults need slightly more. If you\u2019re not getting enough sleep each night, you probably feel sluggish\nand tired all day and you probably also find it hard to think clearly. It\u2019s no wonder that a lack of\nsleep is often the cause of accidents and poor decision-making ability.\nNo amount of caffeine can make up for the sleep you missed the night before. In fact, caffeine, alcohol, and other drugs can all interfere with your ability to sleep at night. Your body needs\na proper amount of rest because it uses the time when you are asleep to repair itself. If you\u2019re not\nsleeping, your body can\u2019t heal itself properly.\nIf you wake up many times throughout the night, if you snore excessively, or if you wake\nup gasping for breath, these can all be signs of sleep disorders, and you should talk to a medical\nprofessional.\nDo your best to develop proper sleep habits in order to get the rest that you need. Refer to the\nGuide to Sleep Hygiene on page 142 to develop healthy sleep habits if you need help. Then, in the\nspace below, record any thoughts you have about how your own sleep habits affect how you feel, and\nwrite at least two ways you can improve your sleep habits in order to feel better.\nMy sleep (or lack of sleep) affects how I feel because\n140 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 150]\nI can improve my sleep habits by\n1)\n2)\nIllness and Physical Pain\nObviously, if you\u2019re experiencing any illness or physical pain, this will affect how you feel\nemotionally. Your physical feelings and your emotional feelings are directly connected, and sometimes it\u2019s hard or impossible to feel emotionally healthy if you aren\u2019t also feeling physically healthy.\nTherefore, it\u2019s critical that you get medical help for any illness or physical pain you might be experiencing. Furthermore, it\u2019s also extremely important for you to follow the advice of the medical\nprofessional who is treating your illness and to follow the prescription plan for any medications\nyou might be given.\nTo prevent possible illness and physical pain in the future, if you aren\u2019t already experiencing\nthem now, use the guidelines in this section to create a healthier life based upon proper nutrition,\nplenty of exercise, avoidance of alcohol and nonprescribed drugs, and plenty of necessary sleep.\nIn the space below, record any thoughts you have about how your own illness or physical pain\naffects how you feel, and then write at least two ways you can treat any illness or pain in order\nto feel better.\nMy illness or pain affects how I feel because\nI can treat my illness or pain by\n1)\n2)\nBasic Emotion Regulation Skills 141\n[Page 151]\nGuIDE TO SLEEP HYGIENE\nProper sleep habits are essential for any healthy lifestyle. Use the following suggestions if you have\ntrouble falling asleep or staying asleep.\n\u000e Avoid caffeine for at least six hours before going to sleep.\n\u000e Avoid alcohol, nicotine, and street drugs before going to sleep and throughout the\nnight.\n\u000e Avoid bright lights, including television, before going to sleep because they are\nstimulating.\n\u000e Don\u2019t exercise or eat a heavy meal shortly before going to sleep.\n\u000e Avoid napping during the day because it will make you less tired at night.\n\u000e Make your bedroom as comfortable as possible. Keep the temperature at a cool,\ncomfortable level, keep your room as dark as possible (use a sleep mask if you need\none), and minimize as much noise as possible (use earplugs if you need them).\n\u000e Only use your bed for sleeping and sexual activity, not for working, reading, or\nwatching television. This way, your body will associate your bed with sleep, not\nwith activity.\n\u000e If you have trouble falling asleep or if you wake up in the middle of the night and\ncan\u2019t fall back to sleep, get out of bed and do something soothing until you feel\ntired enough to go back to sleep. Don\u2019t lie in bed thinking about other things; this\nwill just make you feel more aggravated and make it harder to get back to sleep.\n\u000e Go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every\nmorning. Create a regular pattern of sleeping and waking that your body can\npredict.\n\u000e Use some kind of relaxation method before going to sleep in order to calm your body\nand mind: take a bath, meditate, pray, write down your thoughts, use relaxation\nskills, and so on.\n\u000e If your sleep problems persist, if you can\u2019t stay awake during the day, or if you\u2019re\nfeeling depressed, contact a medical professional for advice.\n142 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 152]\nPhysical Tension and Stress\nIf you experience physical tension on a regular basis, you also probably feel emotionally\nstressed-out, anxious, drained, or irritated. Muscle tension, like an illness, directly affects your\nemotions. Similarly, if you feel anxious, your emotions can often lead to muscle tension, especially\nin the neck and shoulders, as well as stomach ailments and skin problems.\nThere are many situations in modern life that can make you feel physically tensed and\nstressed: long working hours, a job you don\u2019t like, commuting to work, difficult relationships, a\ndemanding family schedule, what\u2019s happening in the world news, politics, and so on. As a result,\nit\u2019s very important that you find healthy ways to cope with tension and stress so that they don\u2019t\nlead to further illness.\nMany good coping skills are found in this book in the mindfulness and distress tolerance chapters. The mindful breathing exercise is very effective for helping you relax, as are many of the selfsoothing exercises. Go back to those chapters, if you need to, to find exercises that work for you.\nIn the space below, record any thoughts you have about how your physical tension and stress\naffect how you feel, and then write at least two ways you can cope with your stress and tension in\norder to feel better.\nMy tension and stress affect how I feel because\nI can treat my tension and stress by\n1)\n2)\nExercise: Recognizing Your Self-Destructive Behaviors\nNow that you\u2019ve learned about different forms of self-destructive behaviors and physical vulnerabilities, make photocopies of the following Recognizing Your Self-Destructive Behaviors Worksheet\nto observe your own self-harming actions for the next two weeks. This worksheet is very similar\nto the Recognizing Your Emotions Worksheet found earlier in this chapter. However, this exercise\nasks you to observe your self-destructive behaviors and then to identify what the emotional rewards\nwere for your behavior and why those rewards were only temporary. Use the following example\nworksheet to help you.\nBasic Emotion Regulation Skills 143\n[Page 153]\n144 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\nTEEHSKROW\nSROIvAHEB\nEvITCuRTSED-FLES\nRuOY\nGNIzINGOCER\n:ELPMAxE\nsesnopseR\nruoY\nsnoitseuQ\nthginoT\n?neppah\nnoitautis\neht\ndid\nnehW\nehs\ntub ,revo\nemoc\not\nreh\ndeksa\nI\n.thgif\na otni\ntog I\ndna dneirflrig\nyM\n?deneppah\ntahW\nod\ndluow\nI tahw\nwonk\nt\u2019ndid\nI reh\ndlot\nI nehT\n.ysub\noot saw\nehs\ndias\n).tneve\neht\nebircseD(\n.did\nehs\nos ,revo\nemoc\nt\u2019ndid\nehs\nfi flesym\not\nemoh\nsteg\nehs\nnehw\nderit\ns\u2019ehs\nwonk\nosla\nI tuB\n.semitemos\nhsifles\ns\u2019ehS\n?deneppah\nnoitautis\ntaht\nkniht\nuoy\nod\nyhW\nerew\neW\n.gnikat\ns\u2019ehs\nsessalc\nemos\nrof\ngniyduts\nosla\ns\u2019ehS\n.krow\nmorf\n).sesuac\neht\nyfitnedI(\n.sdoom\ndab ni\nhtob\nregnA\n:snoitome\nyramirP\nyllanoitome\nhtob\n,leef\nuoy\nekam\nnoitautis\ntaht\ndid\nwoH\nthgim\nehs\ntaht\ndiarfa\n,deyonna\n,sselepoH\n:snoitome\nyradnoceS\n?yllacisyhp\ndna\nem\nevael\neht\ndna\nsnoitome\nyramirp\neht\nhtob\nyfitnedi\not yrT(\n.dehcnelc\nsdnah\nym\n,toh\nemaceb\necaf yM\n:snoitasnes\nlacisyhP\n).snoitome\nyradnoces\nthguoht\nosla\nI\n.si ehs\nhsifles\nwoh\nreh\nllet\ndna reh\nta maercs\not detnaw\nI\n?tlef\nuoy\nwoh\nfo\ntluser\na\nsa\nod\not\ntnaw\nuoy\ndid\ntahW\n.tsap\neht\nni enod\nev\u2019I\nekil\n,mra\nym gnirracs\ntuoba\n)?segru\nruoy\nerew\ntahW(\nwonk\nt\u2019ndid\nI\nro ,em\ndevol\nyllaer\nehs\nfi revo\nemoc\not\ndah ehs\nreh\ndlot\nI\n?yas\ndna\nod\nuoy\ndid\ntahW\nreh\nrof gnitiaw\ntuohtiw\nenohp\neht\npu\ngnuh I\nnehT\n.od dluow\nI\ntahw\na\nsa\nni\negagne\nuoy\ndid\nsroivaheb\nevitcurtsed-fles\ntahW(\nI\nelihw maerc\neci\nfo\nnollag-flah\na\neta dna\nnehctik\neht\nni tnew\nI\n.ylper\n)?tlef\nuoy\nwoh\nfo\ntluser\n.thgin\nlla\npeels\nt\u2019ndid\nI .revo\nemoc\not reh\nrof detiaw\n.doog\nleef em\nedam\nhcihw\n,revo\nemoc\not\nreh tog\nI ,reh\ngnitalupinam\nyB\nruoy\nrof\ndrawer\nlanoitome\neht\nsaw\ntahW\n.thguof\new ,revo\nemac\nehs\nnehw\ntuB\n?roivaheb\nevitcurtsed-fles\nneeb\nev\u2019I\ntub\n,elihw\nelttil\na\nrof\ndoog\nleef\nem edam\nosla\nmaerc\neci\nehT\n).yraropmet\nsaw\ndrawer\nlanoitome\neht\nwoh\nyfitnedI(\ntoN .ytliug\nleef\nem\nsekam\nhcihw\n,yletal\nthgiew\nhcum\noot\nno gnittup\n.gninrom\ntxen\neht\nesrow\nleef\nem edam\ntsuj\nthgin\nrehtona\ngnipeels\n[Page 154]\nBasic Emotion Regulation Skills 145\nTEEHSKROW\nSROIvAHEB\nEvITCuRTSED-FLES\nRuOY\nGNIzINGOCER\nsesnopseR\nruoY\nsnoitseuQ\n?neppah\nnoitautis\neht\ndid nehW\n?deneppah\ntahW\n).tneve\neht\nebircseD(\n?deneppah\nnoitautis\ntaht\nkniht\nuoy\nod\nyhW\n).sesuac\neht\nyfitnedI(\n:snoitome\nyramirP\n-noitome\nhtob\n,leef\nuoy\nekam\nnoitautis\ntaht\ndid\nwoH\n:snoitome\nyradnoceS\n?yllacisyhp\ndna\nylla\n:snoitasnes\nlacisyhP\neht\ndna\nsnoitome\nyramirp\neht\nhtob\nyfitnedi\not\nyrT(\n).snoitome\nyradnoces\n?tlef\nuoy\nwoh\nfo\ntluser\na\nsa\nod\not\ntnaw\nuoy\ndid tahW\n)?segru\nruoy\nerew\ntahW(\n?yas\ndna\nod\nuoy\ndid tahW\nsa\nni\negagne\nuoy\ndid\nsroivaheb\nevitcurtsed-fles\ntahW(\n)?tlef\nuoy\nwoh\nfo tluser\na\nruoy\nrof\ndrawer\nlanoitome\neht\nsaw tahW\n?roivaheb\nevitcurtsed-fles\n).yraropmet\nsaw\ndrawer\nlanoitome\neht\nwoh\nyfitnedI(\n[Page 155]\nOBSERvING YOuRSELF WITHOuT JuDGING YOuRSELF\nAs you can see from the previous exercise, self-destructive behaviors can only offer you temporary\nrelief. In the long term, they are all more damaging to yourself and others. For this reason, it\u2019s\nimportant that you begin to notice what the rewards are for all of your behaviors, but especially\nthe self-destructive ones.\nBut at the same time, also remember that you shouldn\u2019t criticize or judge yourself if you\ndiscover unhealthy rewards reinforcing your behaviors. Remember that the principle on which\ndialectical behavior therapy is based states that two apparently contradictory things can both be\ntrue. The most important dialectic is accepting yourself without judgment while simultaneously\nchanging destructive behaviors so you can live a healthier life (Linehan, 1993a). It\u2019s not wrong to\nadmit that some of your behaviors need to be changed; you can still be a good, kind, and loving\nperson. Your behaviors probably exist as they do because you were never taught how to deal with\nyour overwhelming and distressing emotions in any other way. If you had been shown a healthier\nway to deal with your emotions, you\u2019d probably do it, wouldn\u2019t you? That\u2019s what the skills in this\nworkbook are all about\u2014teaching you healthier ways to cope with your feelings.\nREDuCING YOuR COGNITIvE vuLNERABILITY\nYou\u2019ve already learned how your thoughts influence how you feel. Remember Jim who lost his\nwatch? He originally thought, \u201cI\u2019m so absentminded; I\u2019m an idiot,\u201d which just made him feel\nworse about what he had done. This type of thought is called a trigger thought (McKay, Rogers, &\nMcKay, 2003) because it triggers, or causes, emotional pain and suffering. If you frequently dwell\non trigger thoughts, you probably experience overwhelming emotions more frequently than other\npeople. However, we all have trigger thoughts that pop up from time to time. The goal of developing emotion regulation skills is to learn what to do with those thoughts when they do come up.\nSome of these thoughts are criticisms that we were told when we were children by our parents,\nguardians, teachers, and others. But other trigger thoughts are self-criticisms that we use to insult\nourselves or make our lives more difficult.\nBelow are several trigger thoughts that often cause a person to feel emotionally distressed.\nCheck (\uf0fc) any of them that you use, and then write any additional trigger thoughts in the space\nprovided. If you have trouble remembering a trigger thought that you use, think of the last time\nyou felt upset, angry, sad, depressed, worried, or anxious, and then remember the thoughts you had\nthat made you feel worse. These are your trigger thoughts. Here are some examples:\n\u201cI\u2019m an idiot/jerk/moron/ .\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t do anything right.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a failure.\u201d\n146 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 156]\n\u201cI\u2019m incompetent.\u201d\n\u201cNo one\u2019s ever going to love me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m unlovable.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m broken.\u201d\n\u201cNo one cares about me.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone always leaves me.\u201d\n\u201cPeople always hurt me.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be alone forever.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t make it in life without the help of .\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t deserve to be happy/successful/loved/ .\u201d\nOther ideas:\nObviously a trigger thought can be a powerful negative force in your life if it constantly\ncomes to your attention and leads to distressing emotions. But remember, in addition to trigger\nthoughts, Jim also used a coping thought, \u201cMistakes happen; nobody\u2019s perfect,\u201d and then he was\nable to feel more at ease. Coping thoughts can be an equally powerful force if you know how to\nuse them. In this section, you\u2019ll learn three cognitive skills to help you deal with trigger thoughts\nand overwhelming emotions: thought and emotion defusing, coping thoughts, and balancing your\nthoughts and feelings.\nExercise: Thought and Emotion Defusion\nThought defusion (Hayes et al., 1999) is a practice that was already taught in chapter 3, Basic\nMindfulness Skills, but it\u2019s so important as an emotion regulation skill that it deserves to be\nrepeated here too. Thought defusion is a skill that helps you \u201cunhook\u201d from your thoughts and\noverwhelming emotions. This is a skill that requires the use of your imagination. The purpose is\nto visualize your thoughts and emotions either as pictures or words, harmlessly floating away from\nyou, and without obsessing about them, analyzing them, or getting stuck on them.\nTypically, people find that imagining their thoughts and emotions floating away in one of the\nfollowing ways is helpful. But if you\u2019ve already been using a different means of visualization, or if\nyou want to create something similar, do what works best for you. Here are some examples:\nBasic Emotion Regulation Skills 147\n[Page 157]\n\u000e Imagine sitting in a field watching your thoughts and emotions floating away on\nclouds.\n\u000e Picture yourself sitting near a stream watching your thoughts and emotions floating\npast on leaves.\n\u000e See your thoughts and emotions written in the sand, and then watch the waves\nwash them away.\nRemember to continue using the concept of radical acceptance while doing this exercise. Let\nyour thoughts and related emotions be whatever they are, and don\u2019t get distracted by fighting them\nor criticizing yourself for having them. Just let the thoughts and emotions come and go.\nFor the purposes of learning emotion regulation skills, you can use one of two variations of\nthis thought- and emotion-defusion exercise. You can start the exercise without any preconceived\nthoughts and simply watch whatever thoughts and related emotions arise, and then let them come\nand go without getting stuck on any of them. Or you can begin this exercise by first focusing on\none of your trigger thoughts. Recall a recent distressing memory in which your trigger thoughts\narose. Notice how you feel emotionally and physically, and then begin the thought-defusion exercise. In this case, many memories from that event (and the trigger thought itself) will come to\nyour thoughts automatically. As they do, continue as usual to watch those thoughts and emotions\ncome and go without analyzing them or getting stuck on them.\nRead the instructions before beginning the exercise to familiarize yourself with the experience. If you feel more comfortable listening to the instructions, use an audio-recording device to\nrecord the instructions in a slow, even voice so that you can listen to them while practicing this\ntechnique. When you are first using thought defusion, set a kitchen timer or an alarm clock for\nthree to five minutes and practice letting go of your thoughts and related emotions until the alarm\ngoes off. Then, as you get more accustomed to using this technique, you can set the alarm for\nlonger periods of time like eight or ten minutes. But don\u2019t expect to be able to sit still that long\nwhen you first start.\nDo this exercise as often as possible. Then, when you feel comfortable with the skill, you can\nbegin letting go of trigger thoughts and distressing emotions in your daily life by briefly closing\nyour eyes and imagining the thoughts and emotions floating past.\nInstructions\nTo begin, find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won\u2019t be disturbed for as long as\nyou\u2019ve set your timer. Turn off any distracting sounds. Take a few slow, long breaths, relax, and close\nyour eyes.\nNow, in your imagination, picture yourself in the scenario that you chose to watch your thoughts\ncome and go, whether it\u2019s by the beach or a stream, in a field or a room, or wherever. Do your best to\nimagine yourself in that scene.\n148 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 158]\nAfter you do, also start to become aware of the thoughts that you\u2019re having. Start to observe the\nthoughts that are coming up, whatever they are. Don\u2019t try to stop your thoughts, and do your best not to\ncriticize yourself for any of the thoughts. Just watch the thoughts arise, and then, using whatever technique\nyou\u2019ve chosen, watch the thoughts disappear.\nIf any of your thoughts is a trigger thought, just note to yourself that you\u2019re having a trigger thought,\nobserve any emotion that it brings up, and then let the thought and emotion go past, by whatever means\nyou\u2019ve chosen, without getting stuck on them and without analyzing them.\nWhatever the thought or emotion is, big or small, important or unimportant, watch it arise in your\nmind and then let it float away or disappear by whichever means you\u2019ve chosen.\nKeep breathing slowly, in and out, as you watch your thoughts and emotions float away.\nWhen you notice distressing emotions arising in you because of your thoughts, let them float past\nin your imagination.\nJust continue to watch the thoughts and feelings arise and disappear. Use pictures or words to represent your thoughts and feelings, whatever works best for you. Do your best to watch the thoughts and\nrelated feelings arise and disappear without getting hooked into them and without criticizing yourself.\nIf more than one thought or feeling comes up at the same time, see them both arise and disappear.\nIf the thoughts and feelings come very quickly, do your best to watch them all disappear without getting\nhooked onto any of them.\nContinue to breathe and watch the thoughts and feelings come and go until your timer goes off.\nWhen you\u2019ve finished, take a few slow, long breaths, and then slowly open your eyes and return\nyour focus to the room.\nUsing Coping Thoughts\nCoping thoughts are designed to soothe your emotions when you\u2019re in a distressing situation.\nThey are statements that remind you of your strength, your past successes, and some commonly\nheld truths. Do you remember what happened to Jim when he lost his watch? Originally, he\nthought, \u201cI\u2019m so absentminded; I\u2019m an idiot,\u201d which made him feel depressed. But then he used\nthe coping thought \u201cMistakes happen; nobody\u2019s perfect,\u201d and he was able to feel more at ease.\nYou already learned about using self-encouraging coping thoughts in chapter 2, Advanced Distress\nTolerance Skills, but they\u2019re so important for helping you regulate your emotions that they need to\nbe repeated here. In the following List of Coping Thoughts, you\u2019ll find many coping thoughts that\nyou can use to remind yourself of your strength and your past successes when you find yourself in\na distressing situation.\nFind a few coping thoughts that you consider powerful and motivating, or create your own.\nThen write them on a note card and keep them with you in your wallet to remind yourself of them\nwhen you\u2019re in a distressing situation. Or put them on sticky notes and post them in spots where\nyou can see them on a regular basis, like on your refrigerator or mirror. The more often you see\nthese soothing and self-affirming thoughts, the quicker they\u2019ll become an automatic part of your\nthought process.\nBasic Emotion Regulation Skills 149\n[Page 159]\nHere\u2019s a list of some coping thoughts that many people have found to be helpful (McKay et\nal., 1997).

But you\ncan also be overwhelmed by your emotions when you only pay attention to part of what\u2019s really\nhappening. This type of thinking is called filtering (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979). Here are\nsome examples:\n\u000e Zeva was a straight-A student, she always made the honor roll, and she had already\nreceived a full scholarship to her first choice of colleges. But when she got a poor\ngrade on her math test she broke down. \u201cI\u2019m such a loser,\u201d she thought to herself,\nand, very quickly, she felt overwhelmed, upset, and angry.\n\u000e Antonio asked his girlfriend if she could come over at three o\u2019clock. She said that\nshe was busy until seven, and she\u2019d come over then. Antonio immediately got\nangry and accused her of abandoning him.\n\u000e Jennifer grew up in a typical middle-class family in a fairly good neighborhood.\nMost often, her parents were kind and supportive, and they always tried to do their\nbest for her. However, one day when Jennifer was five, her father punished her for\ntalking back to him, and she was grounded for a week. Later, as an adult, whenever\nJennifer thought about her young life, she only remembered that incident, and she\ngot upset whenever she thought about it.\nDo you see the filtering in each person\u2019s thought process? Zeva was devastated by one less-thanperfect grade because she filtered out all of her past successes. Antonio filtered out the fact that his\ngirlfriend said she would come over at a different, more convenient time. And Jennifer filtered out all\nof her positive childhood experiences and only focused on the one hardship she\u2019d experienced.\nImagine living your life with dark sunglasses on all the time so that it\u2019s impossible to see the\ncolors of the world. Think about what a limited, dreary life you might have. Similarly, when you\nfilter your experience and only focus on the distressing elements of your life, you\u2019re also choosing\nto live a limited, unfulfilling life.\nIn order to begin balancing your thoughts\u2014and therefore your emotions as well\u2014it\u2019s necessary\nto examine the evidence that supports both sides of an emotion-stimulating event:\n\u000e Evidence supporting your self-criticisms versus evidence that you\u2019re a good person\n\u000e Evidence that only bad things happen to you versus evidence that good things\nhappen too\n\u000e Evidence that no one cares about you versus evidence that people do care about\nyou\n\u000e Evidence that you never do anything right versus evidence of your past successes\n\u000e Evidence that the current situation is awful versus evidence that it\u2019s not as bad as\nyou think\nBasic Emotion Regulation Skills 151\n[Page 161]\n\u000e In general, evidence for the bad versus evidence for the good\nSeeing the \u201cbig picture\u201d is the opposite of filtering. This can be hard to do if you\u2019ve spent your\nlife narrowly focusing on just the negative evidence in your life. But you can learn to see the big\npicture by examining the evidence that goes against your distressing thoughts and feelings. These\nfacts, which are often ignored by people with overwhelming emotions, fill out the rest of the big\npicture and can often change how you feel about a situation. Then, with practice, you\u2019ll filter less\nof your experiences and become less overwhelmed by your emotions.\nIn order to see the big picture, use the following guidelines. Whenever you find yourself in a\nsituation in which you feel overwhelmed by your emotions, ask yourself these questions:\n1 . What happened?\n2 . As a result, what did you think and feel? (Be specific.)\n3 . What evidence supports how you think and feel?\n4 . What evidence contradicts how you think and feel?\n5 . What\u2019s a more accurate and fair way to think and feel about this situation?\n6 . What can you do to cope with this situation in a healthy way?\nNaturally, when you start to feel overwhelmed by a situation, first ask yourself what happened.\nThis is the best place to start. Identify what it is that\u2019s making you feel upset. Using Zeva as an\nexample, she would have noted that she got a poor grade on her math test.\nSecond, identify your thoughts and feelings. Remember, your thoughts greatly influence\nhow you feel. But if your thoughts about a situation are being filtered and you\u2019re not seeing the\nbig picture, your thoughts are more likely to cause overwhelming, distressing emotions. In Zeva\u2019s\nexample, she thought, \u201cI\u2019m such a loser,\u201d and then she felt overwhelmed, upset, and angry.\nThird, ask yourself what evidence supports how you\u2019re thinking and feeling about the situation. This is usually an easy question to answer. If you\u2019ve spent your life filtering your experiences\nso that you only see the negative, distressing facts, it\u2019s easy to think of lots of reasons why you feel\nso distressed and overwhelmed. After all, this is what you usually do. Zeva could easily identify\nwhy she was feeling so upset: she had studied hard, as she always did, but had gotten a poor grade\non her test, which was her lowest score all year.\nThe fourth question, however, is usually new and challenging for people struggling with overwhelming emotions. Asking yourself to identify the evidence that contradicts how you think and\nfeel about a situation requires that you view the situation in a new and deeper way. For instance,\nimagine how much different the world must look to a person standing on the street when compared\nto a person flying above in an airplane. They\u2019re both looking at the same landscape, but the person\nin the plane has a better view of the whole landscape\u2014the big picture.\nSimilarly, you need to examine more of the facts and evidence that affect your situation and\nmake up your big picture. As you saw earlier in the examples, people often filter out the positive\nelements of their lives and ignore the facts that might change the way they feel about a situation. If\nyou really want to stop being overwhelmed by your emotions, you\u2019ll have to look at all those facts.\n152 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 162]\nRemember what Zeva filtered out? She\u2019s a straight-A student, she\u2019s on the honor roll, and she got\na full scholarship to her first choice of colleges. Now consider how that information contradicts\nwhat she thought (\u201cI\u2019m a loser\u201d) and how she felt (overwhelmed, upset, and angry). Obviously, Zeva\nfiltered out some very important pieces of her big picture.\nRemember, since this question is new for you, it often takes some time to think of an answer.\nSo give yourself a few minutes to think about the possible facts before saying, \u201cThere is no contradictory evidence.\u201d Be fair and kind to yourself. There\u2019s always evidence for and against any topic.\nAnd even if the contradictory evidence is minor, it still adds to your big picture. Consider Zeva\u2019s\nexample. Even if her example was different and she was a B student or a hardworking student,\nthese facts still could have changed the way she felt about the poor grade. No fact or contradictory\npiece of evidence is too small to be overlooked.\nNext, keeping in mind the new evidence that contradicts the trigger thought, ask yourself\nif there is a more accurate and fair way to think and feel about this situation. This is a good\ntime to be mindful of your emotions and to use radical acceptance. Remember, this exercise is\ndesigned to help you look at your emotional reactions in a new way; it is not designed to criticize\nyou. Therefore, don\u2019t be critical of yourself. Try to be accepting of yourself and your emotions as\nyou continue to see your emotions in a new way. In this step, add the new evidence to your big\npicture and try to create a more accurate and fair way to think and feel about this situation. In\nreality, this might not change how you feel right now, but it will help you to notice how you could\nfeel about this situation in the future. Using these skills, Zeva\u2019s answer could have been something\nlike, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to feel disappointed because I studied a lot and I didn\u2019t do well. But this is just one\nbad grade. I mostly get A\u2019s, and I\u2019m doing well in general.\u201d\nFinally, Zeva would have asked, \u201cWhat can I do to cope with this situation in a healthy way?\u201d\nHere is where you should draw from all the skills and techniques you\u2019ve learned in this workbook to\nhelp you distract, relax, and cope. For example, Zeva could have used some of the distress tolerance\nand self-soothing skills to calm her emotions, like talking to a friend or listening to some relaxing\nmusic. She could also have used her mindfulness skills, like mindful breathing or thought defusion.\nOr she could have used a coping thought, like \u201cNobody\u2019s perfect; everyone makes mistakes.\u201d\nObviously, using the questions in this exercise isn\u2019t going to magically change the way you feel\nright away. But asking yourself these questions will help you recognize the facts that you\u2019ve been filtering out, and it will also show you the possibilities of how you might react to a similar situation in the\nfuture. Then, with practice, you\u2019ll start reacting to those similar situations in a new, healthier way.\nSeeing the big picture will also give you hope for your future. Many people who filter their\nexperiences feel hopeless and desperate because they\u2019re only seeing the problems and the difficulties in their lives. But looking for contrary evidence opens up their perspectives and lets them see\nthat their lives do include some positive experiences. Looking for evidence against overwhelming\nemotions is like taking off those dark sunglasses so that you can see the variety of colors in your\nlife, and that\u2019s a hopeful experience.\nUse the following evidence log to help you recognize the evidence for and against the ways\nyou think and feel. Make photocopies of the log and keep one with you. Then, when you\u2019re in\na situation in which you feel overwhelmed, use the log to help you see the big picture. Use the\nfollowing example of Zeva\u2019s experience to help you.\nBasic Emotion Regulation Skills 153\n[Page 163]\n154 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\nGOL\nECNEDIvE\nERuTCIP-GIB\n:ELPMAxE\nsesnopseR\nruoY\nsnoitseuQ\n.tset\nhtam\nym\nno\nedarg\nroop\na\ntog\nI\n?deneppah\ntahW\n\u201d.resol\na hcus\nm\u2019I\u201c\n:sthguohT\n?leef\ndna\nkniht\nuoy\ndid\ntahw\n,tluser\na\nsA\nyrgna\ndna\n,tespu\n,demlehwrevO\n:sgnileeF\n).cificeps\neB(\ntog\nylno\nllits\nI\ndna\n,od\nyllausu\nI\nekil\n,dluoc\nI\nsa drah\nsa\ndeiduts\nI\n?gnileef\ndna\ngnikniht\ner\u2019uoy\nwoh\nstroppus\necnedive\ntahW\n.raey\nlla\nssalc\nni\nedarg\ntsewol\nym\ns\u2019tahT\n.edarg\nroop\na\nlluf\na\ntog\nI\ndnA\n.llor\nronoh\neht\nno m\u2019I\n.tneduts\nA-thgiarts\na\nm\u2019I\n?gnileef\ndna\ngnikniht\ner\u2019uoy\nwoh\nstcidartnoc\necnedive\ntahW\n.segelloc\nfo eciohc\ntsrif\nym\not\npihsralohcs\nllits\ndna\ntol\na\ndeiduts\nI\nesuaceb\ndetnioppasid\nleef\not\nyako\ns\u2019tI\nriaf\ndna\netarucca\nerom\na\ns\u2019tahw\n,ecnedive\neht\nlla\ngniredisnoC\n,s\u2019A\nteg\nyltsom\nI .edarg\ndab\neno\ntsuj\nsi\nsiht\ntuB\n.llew\nod\nt\u2019ndid\n?noitautis\nsiht\ntuoba\nleef\ndna\nkniht\not\nyaw\n.lareneg\nni\nllew\ngniod\nm\u2019I\ndna\n.noisufed\nthguoht\nesU\n.ekil\nI cisum\not\nnetsiL\n.sdneirf\nym\not\nklaT\nreihtlaeh\na\nni\nnoitautis\nsiht\nhtiw\nepoc\not\nod\nuoy\nnac\ntahW\n;tcefrep\ns\u2019ydoboN\u201c\n:thguoht\ngnipoc\nym esU\n.gnihtaerb\nlufdnim\nesU\n?yaw\n\u201d.sekatsim\nsekam\nydobyreve\n[Page 164]\nBasic Emotion Regulation Skills 155\nGOL\nECNEDIvE\nERuTCIP-GIB\nsesnopseR\nruoY\nsnoitseuQ\n?deneppah\ntahW\n:sthguohT\n).cificeps\neB(\n?leef\ndna\nkniht\nuoy\ndid\ntahw\n,tluser\na\nsA\n:sgnileeF\n?gnileef\ndna\ngnikniht\ner\u2019uoy\nwoh\nstroppus\necnedive\ntahW\n?gnileef\ndna\ngnikniht\ner\u2019uoy\nwoh\nstcidartnoc\necnedive\ntahW\nriaf\ndna\netarucca\nerom\na\ns\u2019tahw\n,ecnedive\neht\nlla\ngniredisnoC\n?noitautis\nsiht\ntuoba\nleef\ndna\nkniht\not\nyaw\nreihtlaeh\na\nni\nnoitautis\nsiht\nhtiw\nepoc\not\nod\nuoy\nnac\ntahW\n?yaw\n[Page 165]\nINCREASING YOuR POSITIvE EMOTIONS\nBefore you picked up this workbook for the first time, you were probably an expert on distressing emotions and you understood what a life filled with them could feel like. Now, however, you\nunderstand that many people with overwhelming emotions discount their pleasurable emotions,\nfilter them out, or never take the opportunity to experience them in the first place. As a result,\nthey focus only on their distressing emotions, such as anger, fear, and sadness, and they rarely\nnotice their pleasurable emotions, such as happiness, surprise, and love.\nMaybe that\u2019s what you did before, but now you know that it\u2019s very important for you to\nbegin noticing your pleasurable emotions. As you continue to use dialectical behavior therapy to\nimprove your life, you\u2019ll want to find more ways of experiencing pleasurable emotions, if you don\u2019t\nhave enough of them in your life already. This doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ll never experience another\ndistressing feeling. That\u2019s impossible. We all have distressing emotions at different points in our\nlives. But your life doesn\u2019t have to be dominated by them.\nOne very reliable way of focusing on pleasurable emotions is to create pleasurable experiences\nfor yourself. Again, this is a skill that you\u2019ve already learned in chapter 1, Basic Distress Tolerance\nSkills, but it deserves to be repeated here. To begin building a more balanced, healthier life for\nyourself, take some time out of each day to create a pleasurable experience for yourself, and make\nnote of how you felt and what you thought as a result of that experience.\nIf you need help thinking of pleasurable experiences, use the Big List of Pleasurable Activities\nfound in chapter 1 on pages 15-16. Then use the following Pleasurable Activities Log and the\nexample to record what you did, how you felt, and what you thought about the experience.\nRemember, try to do something pleasurable for yourself every day. You deserve it.\n156 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 166]\nBasic Emotion Regulation Skills 157\nGOL\nSEITIvITCA\nELBARuSAELP\n:ELPMAxE\n?knihT\nuoY\ndiD\ntahW\n?leeF\nuoY\ndiD\nwoH\n?oD\nuoY\ndiD\ntahW\n?nehW\n\u201d.netfo\nerom\nsiht\nod\ndluohs\nI\u201c\nmlac\ndna\ndexaler\nyreV\n.htab\ntoh\na\nkoot\nI\nthgin\nyadsendeW\nI\nfi\nneve\ndoof\ndoog\nyojne\nI\u201c\nyppah\ndna\ndeifsitaS\nsuoiciled\na\not\nflesym\ndetaert\nI\nnoonretfa\nyadsruhT\n\u201d.ti\ndroffa\nsyawla\nt\u2019nac\n.krow\nta\nhcnul\nhguone\nhctaw\nt\u2019nod\nI\u201c\ntol\na\ndehgual\n;doog\nyreV\ndna\nenohp\nym\nffo\ndenrut\nI\nthgin\nyadsruhT\n\u201d.seidemoc\n.eivom\na\ndehctaw\ntaht\nekil\ntuo\ntnew\new\nhsiw\nI\u201c\nyppah\n,suovren\n,deticxE\nym\nhtiw\nrennid\not\ntnew\nI\nthgin\nyadirF\n\u201d.netfo\nerom\n.dneirfyob\n\u201d.netfo\nerom\nemoc\ndluohs\nI\u201c\nmlac\n,laiceps\n,yloH\nsuoigiler\nrof\nelpmet\not\ntnew\nI\ngninrom\nyadrutaS\nsecivres\n\u201d.lufituaeb\nsaw\nekal\nehT\u201c\nlufecaep\ndna\nmlaC\n.ekal\neht\nta\nklaw\na rof\ntnew\nI\nnoonretfa\nyadrutaS\n\u201d.yppah\nsiht\ngnieb\nssim\nI\u201c\nI\nnehw\not\ndesu\nI\nekil\n,yppaH\nretfa\nmaerc\neci\nrof\ntuo\ntnew\nI\nnoonretfa\nyadrutaS\nregnuoy\nsaw\n.klaw\neht\nteiuq\nod\not\necin\ns\u2019ti\nsemitemoS\u201c\nteiuq\ndna\ndexaleR\n.daer\ndna\nemoh\nta\ndeyats\nI\nthgin\nyadrutaS\n\u201d.sgniht\ngnirud\npeels\nhguone\nteg\nt\u2019nod\nI\u201c\ndetser\nyreV\n.etal\ntpels\nI\ngninrom\nyadnuS\n\u201d.keew\neht\n\u201d.thgin\nyreve\nsiht\nod\ndluohs\nI\u201c\ndexaler\nyreV\n.htab\nelbbub\nrehtona\nkoot\nI\nthgin\nyadnuS\n[Page 167]\n158 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\nGOL\nSEITIvITCA\nELBARuSAELP\n?knihT\nuoY\ndiD\ntahW\n?leeF\nuoY\ndiD\nwoH\n?oD\nuoY\ndiD\ntahW\n?nehW\n[Page 168]\nchapter 7\nAdvanced Emotion\nRegulation Skills\nIn this chapter you will learn four advanced emotion regulation skills:\n1 . Being mindful of your emotions without judgment\n2 . Emotion exposure\n3 . Doing the opposite of your emotional urges\n4 . Problem solving\nIn chapter 3, Basic Mindfulness Skills, you learned how to recognize and describe your emotions. Now, in this chapter, emotion exposure will further help you practice two very important\nthings. First, you will learn to observe the natural life cycle of your emotions, watching them rise\nand fall, shift and change as new emotions replace old ones. Second, you\u2019ll learn that you can\nendure\u2014without avoidance or resistance\u2014your strong feelings. You\u2019ll get practice staying \u201cin\u201d the\nemotion even though you want to run or turn the feeling into action (shouting, hitting, or breaking things). Emotion exposure is a crucial process for learning not to fear your feelings. And it will\nstrengthen your emotion regulation skills. The more you practice this exposure work, the more\nconfident you\u2019ll become as you face tough emotional challenges.\nIn addition to being mindful of your emotions without judgment and emotion exposure, you\u2019ll\nlearn a behavioral technique called doing the opposite of your emotional urges. When you have a\nstrong emotion, it affects behavior in two ways. First, you change your facial expression and body\nlanguage to reflect your feeling. If you\u2019re angry, you may begin to scowl and tighten your fists.\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019re scared, your eyes may open wide while you hunch your shoulders.\nThe second behavioral change comes from action urges that accompany every emotion. Anger,\nfor example, may produce urges to shout or hit, while fear might push you to cower or back away.\n[Page 169]\n\u201cDoing the opposite of your emotional urges\u201d is a strategy that blocks ineffective, emotion-driven\nresponses while often helping you to soften the feeling itself.\nThe next step will be learning key behavior analysis and problem-solving skills to deal more\neffectively with high-emotion situations. You\u2019ll identify what prompts the emotion and learn how\nto develop alternative strategies to cope with emotion-triggering events.\nThe last thing we\u2019ll do in this chapter is introduce you to an exercise regime called the Weekly\nRegulator. It will help you to keep practicing the key emotion regulation skills you\u2019ve learned here.\nLearning to be mindful of your emotions with9out judging them decreases the chance that they\nwill grow in intensity and become even more painful.\nBEING MINDFuL OF YOuR EMOTIONS\nWITHOuT JuDGMENT\nLearning to be mindful of your emotions without judging them decreases the chance that they will\ngrow in intensity and become even more overwhelming or painful.\nExercise: Being Mindful of Your Emotions Without Judgment\nThis technique begins with the mindful awareness of your breath. Focus on the feeling of the air\nmoving across your throat, how your ribs expand and contract, and the sense of your diaphragm\nstretching and releasing. After four or five slow, deep breaths, you can do one of two things: (1)\nobserve whatever current emotion you may be feeling, or if you can\u2019t identify an emotion, (2) visualize a recent scene where you experienced an emotional reaction. If you visualize a scene, notice\nas many details as possible. Try to remember what was said and how you and others acted.\nRead the instructions before beginning the exercise to familiarize yourself with the experience. If you feel more comfortable listening to the instructions, use an audio-recording device to\nrecord the directions in a slow, even voice, so that you can listen to them while practicing this\ntechnique.\nInstructions\nWhile breathing slowly and evenly, bring your attention to where you are feeling the emotion in your\nbody. Is it a feeling in your chest or stomach, in your shoulders, or in your face or head? Are you feeling\nit in your arms or legs? Notice any physical sensations connected with the emotion. Now be aware of the\nstrength of the feeling. Is it growing or diminishing? Is the emotion pleasant or painful? Try to name the\nemotion or describe some of its qualities.\n160 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 170]\nNow try to notice your thoughts. Do you have thoughts about the emotion? Does the emotion\ntrigger judgments about others or about yourself? Just keep watching your emotion and keep observing\nyour judgments.\nNow imagine that each judgment is one of the following:\n\u000e A leaf floating down a stream, around a bend, and out of sight\n\u000e A computer pop-up ad that briefly flashes on the screen and disappears\n\u000e One of a long string of boxcars passing in front of you at a railroad crossing\n\u000e A cloud cutting across a windy sky\n\u000e A message written on a billboard that you approach and pass at high speed\n\u000e One of a procession of trucks or cars approaching and passing you on a desert\nhighway\nChoose the image that works best for you. The key is to notice the judgment, place it on a billboard\nor leaf or boxcar, and let it go.\nJust keep observing your emotion. When a judgment about yourself or others begins to manifest,\nturn it into a visualization (leaf, cloud, billboard, and so on) and watch while it moves away and out\nof sight.\nNow it\u2019s time to remind yourself of the right to feel whatever you feel. Emotions come and go, like\nwaves on the sea. They rise up and then recede. Whatever you feel, no matter how strong or painful, is\nlegitimate and necessary. Take a slow breath and accept the emotion as something that lives in you for\na little while\u2014and then passes.\nNotice your judgmental thoughts. Visualize them and then let them pass. Let your emotions be what\nthey are, like waves on the sea that rise and fall. You ride your emotions for a little while, and then they\nleave. This is natural and normal. It\u2019s what it means to be human.\nFinish the exercise with three minutes of mindful breathing, counting your out-breaths (1, 2, 3, 4\nand then repeating 1, 2, 3, 4) and focusing on the experience of each moment as you breathe.\nLooking back on this exercise, you may have found it to be hard work. Watching and letting\ngo of judgments may feel very foreign, very strange. But you are doing something important\u2014you\nare learning to observe rather than be controlled by judgmental thoughts. We encourage you to\ndo this exercise three or four times before going on to the next step.\nRemember, the key steps to the practice of observing your emotions without judging them\nare as follows:\n\u000e Focus on breath.\n\u000e Focus on emotion (current or past).\n\u000e Notice physical sensations connected to emotion.\n\u000e Name the emotion.\nAdvanced Emotion Regulation Skills 161\n[Page 171]\n\u000e Notice judgments (about self, others, or the emotion itself) and let them go. Use\n\u201cleaves on a stream\u201d or other image.\n\u000e Watch the emotion; emotions are like waves on the sea.\n\u000e Remind yourself that you have a right to your feelings.\n\u000e Continue to notice and let go of judgments.\n\u000e Finish with three minutes of mindful breathing.\nEMOTION ExPOSuRE\nFacing your emotions instead of avoiding them is a major goal of dialectical behavior therapy.\nEmotion exposure helps you develop the capacity to accept feelings and be less afraid of them.\nStep 1 is to begin keeping an Emotion Log so you can become more aware of specific emotional events and how you cope with them. For the next week, keep a record in your Emotion Log\nfor every significant emotion you experience. Under \u201cEvent,\u201d write down what precipitated your\nfeeling. Triggering events could be internal\u2014a thought, memory, or another feeling\u2014or they could\nbe external, something you or someone else said or did. Under \u201cEmotion,\u201d write a word or phrase\nthat sums up your feeling. Under \u201cCoping or Blocking Response,\u201d write what you did to try to\npush the emotion away. Did you try to suppress or hide it? Did you act on it by picking a fight or\navoiding something scary? This record of your coping or blocking response will help you identify\nemotions for doing emotion exposure later in this chapter.\nexample: emotion log\nLinda, who had been struggling with anger and feelings of rejection, kept the following\nEmotion Log during the week before Christmas.

First,\nidentify the emotions that seem chronic, that show up over and over. Second, notice what coping\nor blocking mechanisms you typically use and their outcome. Do they work? Do you feel better or\nworse a few hours after you use them?\nEmotions that show up repeatedly or have blocking strategies that create more pain than they\nrelieve will be good targets for emotion exposure. Emotions with ineffective or destructive blocking strategies require exposure because you need practice facing and feeling them\u2014without your\ntraditional methods of avoidance. Those don\u2019t work and often just get you in more trouble.\nLinda, after reviewing her log, realized that the things she did to cope with feelings of rejection (attacking or criticizing people, being cold and rejecting) were only digging her into a deeper\nemotional pit. She ended up with overwhelming feelings of guilt and self-hate and seemed even\nmore alienated from her family.\nLinda needed to learn how to be with her feelings and how to observe them without the\ntraditional avoidance strategies. Emotion exposure would prove to be a tremendously important\nskill for her. Here\u2019s how it works.\nExercise: Emotion Exposure\nAs soon as you start feeling the emotion you\u2019ve chosen to work on, do the following procedure.\nYou can either read the instructions to yourself or record and listen to them.\nInstructions\nTake three or four deep diaphragmatic breaths. Notice how the breath feels in your throat, as it fills\nyour lungs, and as it stretches your diaphragm. While breathing slowly, notice how you feel inside your\nbody, particularly your stomach and chest. Notice your neck and shoulders and face. [Pause here for a\nfew seconds if you are recording the instructions.]\nNow notice how you feel emotionally. Just keep your attention on the feeling till you have a sense\nof it. Describe that feeling to yourself. Label it. Notice the strength of the feeling. Find words to describe\nthe intensity. Notice if the emotion is growing or diminishing. If the emotion were a wave, at what point\nof the wave are you now\u2014ascending on the leading edge, on the crest, beginning to slide down the far\nside? [Pause here for a few seconds if you are recording the instructions.]\nNow notice any changes in the feeling. Are there other emotions beginning to weave into the first\none? Describe to yourself any new emotions that have appeared. Just keep watching and looking for words\nto describe the slightest change in the quality or intensity of your feelings. [Pause here for a few seconds\nif you are recording the instructions.]\nAs you continue to watch, you may notice a need to block the emotion, to push it away. That\u2019s\nnormal, but try to keep watching your emotions for just a little while longer. Just keep describing to\nyourself what you feel and noticing any changes. [Pause here for a few seconds if you are recording\nthe instructions.]\nAdvanced Emotion Regulation Skills 165\n[Page 175]\nNotice what it\u2019s like not to act on your feelings, not to blow up or avoid, not to hurt yourself. Just\nbe aware of the feeling without action, watching but not doing.\nRemind yourself that this is a wave that passes, like countless other emotional waves in your life.\nWaves come and go. There are many times when you\u2019ve felt good. Soon this wave will pass, and you will\nfeel, again, a period of calm. Watch the wave and let it slowly pass.\nIf judgment\u2014about yourself or another\u2014arises, notice it and let it go. If you have a judgment\nabout feeling this emotion, notice it and let it go. As best you can, try to accept this feeling. It is just\none of life\u2019s struggles.\nStay aware of your emotions just a little longer. If they are changing, let them change. Describe to\nyourself what you feel. Keep watching until the emotion either changes or diminishes. [Pause here for a\nfew seconds if you are recording the instructions.]\nFinish the exercise with a few minutes of mindful breathing\u2014counting your breaths and focusing\non the experience of each breath.\nWe encourage you to do emotion exposure for brief periods at first\u2014perhaps as little as five\nminutes. As you become more used to focusing on feelings, you will be able to tolerate emotion\nexposure for longer periods. Always be sure to end exposure with mindful breathing because it will\nsoften high-intensity feelings and help to relax you. It will also strengthen mindfulness skills and\nincrease your confidence in your effectiveness.\nRemember, the key steps to doing the Emotion Exposure exercise are:\n\u000e Focus on your breathing.\n\u000e Notice how you feel inside your body.\n\u000e Notice and describe your emotion.\n\u000e Notice if the feeling is growing or diminishing; see it like a wave.\n\u000e Describe any new emotions or changes in quality.\n\u000e Notice any need to block the emotion, but keep watching.\n\u000e Notice impulses to act on your emotion, but keep watching without acting.\n\u000e Notice judgments (about self, others, or the emotion itself), and let them go.\n\u000e Keep watching until the emotion either changes or diminishes.\n\u000e Finish with a few minutes of mindful breathing.\nexample: Using mindfulness of Your emotions and emotion exposure\nAdam had struggled for more than five years with feelings of hurt and anger regarding his exwife . They were now co-parenting Adam\u2019s seven- and ten-year-old children, with the kids spending\n166 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 176]\nhalf the week at each parent\u2019s home. Virtually every time they had contact, Adam\u2019s ex said something that enraged him. And it didn\u2019t end there. He seethed for days afterwards, plotting what he\nmight say or do to get revenge.\nThe Being Mindful of Your Emotions Without Judgment exercise seemed daunting to Adam,\nbut he was exhausted with the constant emotional upheaval. And his doctor had recently warned\nhim about borderline hypertension. He started by focusing on current emotions\u2014nothing to do\nwith his ex-wife. To his surprise, he tended often to feel sad rather than angry.\nAs Adam observed his sadness, he became conscious of a heavy feeling in his abdomen and\nshoulders. He had a sudden image of himself carrying a great weight. Judgments came up\u2014he\nshould be stronger, he wasn\u2019t a good father, he had screwed up his life. He noticed these thoughts\nand let them go, imagining them as a string of boxcars passing before him.\nAdam didn\u2019t fight the sadness\u2014he watched it swell and recede like an ocean wave. He gave\nhimself the right to be sad. Noticing the judgments and letting them go became easier after a few\nexperiences with the exercise. And Adam gained confidence in his ability to calm himself with\nmindful breathing.\nEmotion exposure was more challenging. For this exercise, Adam chose to work on feelings\nthat came up around his ex-wife. His first emotion exposure incident followed a phone call where\nshe accused him of being \u201ccheap and never voluntarily spending anything on the kids.\u201d\nAdam began by noticing the effect of these words on his body. He felt hot, with a disturbing sense of pressure in the chest and neck. (He wondered if it was his blood pressure.) Now he\ndescribed the anger to himself. It felt hard and sharp, surging up with deep disgust. There was\nsomething else too\u2014a sense of helplessness that seemed, he noticed, almost like despair. It was a\nfeeling that things would never be better, never be different.\nAs the despair got stronger, Adam noticed an impulse to turn it off, to block it. He wanted\na beer, and he started planning the retorts he would make to his ex-wife. With an effort, Adam\ncontinued to observe his emotions, not trying to hold on to any particular feeling but keeping his\nattention on whatever he felt.\nAdam was also aware of impulses to act on the despair. He wanted to get angry instead, to\ncall his ex and shout that she was poisoning his relationship with his kids. Then he had images\nof getting in his car and driving into a tree\u2014half for revenge and half to end all the pain he was\nfeeling.\nWhile Adam observed his feelings, judgments kept coming up. His ex was evil, he had been\nstupid to marry her, she had destroyed his life, and it was too messed up to go on living. It took\neffort, but he put every thought on a boxcar and let it roll away.\nAfter a time, Adam noticed something that surprised him. The despair feeling, if he didn\u2019t\nhold on to judgments, began to fade. It softened to a feeling closer to regret.\nAdam now returned the focus to his breathing, counting and observing each breath. Three\nminutes later he felt a dark sort of calm\u2014not the greatest feeling in the world but something he\ncould live with.\nAdvanced Emotion Regulation Skills 167\n[Page 177]\nDOING THE OPPOSITE OF YOuR\nEMOTIONAL uRGES\nThere are good reasons for feeling whatever it is you feel. Even when they are painful, your emotions are legitimate and valid. The larger problem is emotion-driven behavior, because acting on\nemotions often creates destructive outcomes. Letting anger drive you to attack with words can\ndisrupt your relationships. Letting fear drive you to avoid critical tasks and challenges can paralyze\nyou at work.\nA second problem with acting on emotion-driven impulses is that they intensify your original\nfeeling. Instead of getting relief, you may get even more consumed with the emotion. This is where\nopposite action comes in. Rather than fueling your emotion, opposite action helps to regulate and\nchange it. Here are some examples of opposite action.\nExAMPLE: OPPOSITE ACTION\nEmotion Emotion-Driven Behavior Opposite Action\nAnger Attack, criticize, hurt, shout. Validate, avoid or distract,\nuse soft voice.\nFear Avoid, hunch shoulders. Approach what you fear, do\nwhat you\u2019ve been avoiding,\nstand tall.\nSadness Shut down, avoid, be passive, Be active, get involved, set\nslump, hang your head. goals, stand straight.\nGuilt/shame Punish yourself, confess, If unfounded guilt, continue\navoid, shut down. doing whatever is triggering\nguilt; if guilt is justified, atone\nand make amends.\nNotice that opposite action changes both body language (posture, facial expression) and\nactual behavior. Opposite action isn\u2019t about denying or pretending an emotion isn\u2019t happening.\nRather, it is about regulation. You acknowledge the emotion but use the opposite behavior to reduce\nit or encourage a new emotion.\n168 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 178]\nThere are six steps to creating opposite action:\n1 . Start by acknowledging what you feel. Describe the emotion in words.\n2 . Ask yourself if there\u2019s a good reason to regulate or reduce the intensity of this emotion.\nIs it overpowering you? Does it drive you to do dangerous or destructive things?\n3 . Notice the specific body language and behavior (see the \u201cEmotion-Driven Behavior\u201d\ncolumn in the table on page 171) that accompanies the emotion. What\u2019s your facial\nexpression, your posture? What are you saying and how are you saying it? What,\nspecifically, do you do in response to the emotion?\n4 . Identify opposite action. How can you relax your face and body so it doesn\u2019t scream \u201cI\u2019m\nangry\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m scared\u201d? How can you change your posture to convey confidence and\nvitality rather than depression? How can you move toward, not away from, what scares\nyou? When you are angry, how can you acknowledge or ignore rather than attack? Make\na plan for opposite action that includes a specific description of your new behavior.\n5 . Fully commit to opposite action, and set a time frame to work at it. How long will you\nmaintain the opposite behavior? As you think about making a commitment, keep in\nmind why you want to regulate your emotions. What\u2019s happened in the past when you\ngave in to emotion-driven behavior? Were there serious costs to you, to others?\n6 . Monitor your emotions. As you do opposite action, notice how the original emotion may\nchange or evolve. Opposite action literally sends a message to the brain that the old\nemotion is no longer appropriate\u2014and it helps you shift to a less painful emotion.\nNow it\u2019s time to do some advanced planning. You\u2019re going to identify some \u201cfrequent flyer\u201d\nemotions and commit to opposite-action strategies that can help you with regulation.\nFilling out the Opposite-Action Planning Worksheet is simple but potentially very important.\nIn it you\u2019ll identify emotions you can expect to feel in the future and prepare a radically different\nresponse than you\u2019ve had in the past.\nHere\u2019s an example. Remember Linda and the Emotion Log she filled out just before Christmas?\nWhen she began working on her Opposite-Action Planning Worksheet, she identified several opposite actions that she thought might help with her anger, feelings of rejection, and guilt. Here\u2019s what\nshe decided.\nAdvanced Emotion Regulation Skills 169\n[Page 179]\nExAMPLE: LINDA\u2019S OPPOSITE-ACTION PLANNING WORKSHEET\nEmotion Emotion-Driven Opposite Time Period Outcomes\nBehavior Action\nFeeling rejected, 1 .

Attacking\nlike how I was felt in an honest\ntreated. way.\nOver several weeks, Linda monitored her opposite-action outcomes to see how the new\nbehavior worked. What she found was that her anger passed more quickly when she followed her\nopposite-action plan. Using a quiet voice and saying out loud what hurt her seemed to soften the\nupset. At first, she had been afraid to acknowledge her feelings of rejection because it made her\nmore vulnerable. But after trying it several times (for example, telling her father she was sad not to\nbe with him on Christmas day), Linda found that her anger often shifted to something less sharp,\nless painful. And she spent less time ruminating about ways she felt victimized.\nOpposite action isn\u2019t easy. We won\u2019t pretend that it is. But opposite action quickly dulls the\nrazor edge of overwhelming emotions. Fear often turns to empowerment, sadness to engagement,\nanger to detachment, and shame and avoidance to willingness. Planning opposite-action strategies\ncan give you an incredibly effective tool for emotion regulation.\n170 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 180]\nOPPOSITE-ACTION PLANNING WORKSHEET\nEmotion Emotion-Driven Opposite Time Period Outcomes\nBehavior Action\nAdvanced Emotion Regulation Skills 171\n[Page 181]\nPROBLEM SOLvING\nSometimes emotion regulation has to start before the overwhelming feelings begin. Problem solving\nfocuses on the triggering event and finds new, more effective ways to respond.\nBehavior Analysis\nProblem solving begins with something called behavior analysis. Basically, this amounts to\ntracing the sequence of events that led up to a problematic emotion. The Behavior Analysis\nWorksheet will take you step by step through the process.\nexaMple: BehavIor analysIs worksheet\nWhen he did a behavior analysis of his anger reactions, Sam found multiple internal triggers\nhe hadn\u2019t expected.\nSAM\u2019S BEHAvIOR ANALYSIS WORKSHEET\n1 . Problematic emotion: Rage at mother-in-law\n2 . Precipitating event\n\u000e External event: Mother-in-law\u2019s visit. She looks disgusted when she sees my house.\n\u000e Thoughts: House needs paint. The yard is full of weeds and run-down looking. Place is a\ndump.\n3 . Secondary events\na . Emotion: Sadness\nThought: I hate this place.\nb . Emotion: Shame\nThoughts: Why do I spend my life in dumps like this? Why can\u2019t I do better than this? I\nknow why\u2014because I\u2019m a loser who can\u2019t make any money.\nc . Behavior: Accused my mother-in-law of not helping us when we needed it, of not caring\nabout our problems, and when she disagreed, blew up.\n172 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 182]\nNotice that the external event\u2014the mother-in-law\u2019s visit\u2014is only one step in a series. And\nmost of the steps leading to the rage are internal\u2014both thoughts and other painful feelings. If Sam\nis going to better regulate his anger, he may need to identify which steps in the triggering process\nhe wants to change and then use problem solving to plan a different response.\nThe point here is that you can change or soften overwhelming emotions by changing what\nyou do before the emotion sweeps you away. The first step, after completing your behavior analysis,\nis to decide which of the precipitating or secondary events you want to alter. This must be (1) an\nevent you have control over (for example, your own thoughts or behavior) and (2) an event, if\naltered, that\u2019s likely to reduce your problematic emotion.\nIn Sam\u2019s case, he decided to do something about his shame-generating thoughts and the\nverbal attack. Sam realized that all too often over the years, this same pattern had repeated itself\nprior to his getting angry. He\u2019d start with self-shaming thoughts, which would soon feel intolerably\npainful. Then he\u2019d try to mask the shame by finding fault with others, which would trigger anger\nand eventually an attack.\nOnce you\u2019ve identified the precipitating or secondary event(s) you want to change using your\nown Behavior Analysis Worksheet, the next step is to use the ABC Problem Solving technique.\nAdvanced Emotion Regulation Skills 173\n[Page 183]\nBEHAvIOR ANALYSIS WORKSHEET\n1 .

I\u2019ll distract myself with music or get involved in my photography.\n2 . I\u2019ll run things past Millie before getting on anyone\u2019s case; and I\u2019ll give thought-out,\nwritten feedback if I decide to say anything critical.\ncoMMItMent to IMpleMentatIon\nFinally, Sam decided to follow his plan with his mother-in-law for the rest of his visit,\nparticularly whenever he was alone with her and she said something annoying.\nNotice that Sam developed specific alternative behaviors to replace key actions that happened\nbefore he got angry, and he identified a situation where he was committed to using his new plan.\nThe most important thing about problem solving is to know exactly what you\u2019re going to do\ndifferently\u2014and when and where you\u2019ll do it. The more concrete and specific you are, the better.\nNow, using your own example from your Behavioral Analysis Worksheet, work through the same\nsteps, writing your ideas on a blank piece of paper, so that you can create a plan you can commit\nto following.\nWEEKLY REGuLATOR\nEmotion regulation is best achieved when you employ your new skills on a regular basis.

In addition, we\u2019ve added negotiation skills (Fisher & Ury, 1991) to complete the\nprogram.\nRelationships are precious, and they are vulnerable. They bring love, companionship, and\nsupport. Yet, sometimes in a matter of moments, they can become broken beyond repair. Keeping\nyour relationships healthy and alive requires interpersonal skills that you can learn in this chapter\nand the next. The most necessary and important of these skills is assertiveness, which is the ability\nto (1) ask for what you want, (2) say no, and (3) negotiate conflict without damaging the relationship.\nBefore learning assertiveness, however, there are some key things you need to know.\nMINDFuL ATTENTION\nRelationships require attention. Whether it\u2019s a lover, friend, coworker, or merely a carpool companion, maintaining a good relationship depends on noticing the other person\u2019s feelings and reactions\nand then watching the process between you. Using the mindfulness skills you practiced in chapters\n3 through 5, you can observe facial expression, body language, tone of voice, and choice of words\nduring a conversation to get a fix on the mood and state of the relationship.\nPaying attention means staying in the here and now\u2014not thinking about what you want to\nsay next or focusing on some memory. It means remaining present to what you see, hear, and sense\nemotionally. In the same way that you can breathe, walk, or even do dishes mindfully, you can\nalso relate with full awareness to the present moment. When you pay attention, you notice trouble\n[Page 191]\ncoming\u2014before it overwhelms you\u2014and also gain time to ask clarifying questions that can help\nyou correct misconceptions.\nNot paying attention\u2014focusing away from the moment between you and others\u2014has a heavy\nprice. You\u2019ll end up doing one or more of the following:\n\u000e Missing vital cues about the other person\u2019s needs and reactions\n\u000e Projecting, inaccurately, your fears and feelings on the other\n\u000e Blowing up or running away when \u201csurprised\u201d by a negative response you could\nhave seen coming\nMindful attention also involves watching your own experience in relation to others. Do you\nneed something from the other person (for example, more attention or some help)? Do you need\nto change the process between you (for example, critical comments, demands, intrusive questions)? Do you have feelings that signal something important about what\u2019s going on (hurt, sadness,\nloss, shame, anxiety)? Noticing your feelings can help you figure out what needs to change in a\nrelationship\u2014before you blow up or run away.\nIn summary, then, the first interpersonal skill you need to cultivate is mindful attention\nbecause it helps you read important signals about the state of a relationship.\nExercise: Mindful Attention\nIn the very next conversation you have, practice being an observer of the moment by attending to\nthe other person\u2019s physical and verbal behavior. If you find anything ambiguous or hard to read,\nask a clarifying question. Here are some examples:\n\u000e How are you feeling? Are you doing okay?\n\u000e How are we doing? Are we okay?\n\u000e How are things between us?\n\u000e I notice ; is that accurate?\n\u000e Is everything okay with you? With us?\nAlso notice your own needs and feelings in the interaction\u2014do any of these require\ncommunication? How could you say it in a way that preserves the relationship?\nBill had noticed his girlfriend Gina looking away from him during dinner. When he asked\n\u201cHow are things between us?\u201d she told him that she\u2019d been hurt not to be invited to his office\nsolstice party. This gave him a chance to explain that he hated company events and only planned\nto put in an appearance for a few minutes.\n182 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 192]\nPASSIvE vERSuS AGGRESSIvE BEHAvIOR\nThese interpersonal patterns have a huge impact on your relationships. Being passive sometimes\nseems safe. You go along with what the other person expects. Long term, however, passivity is the\nroyal road to interpersonal disaster. When you give in to others and abandon your own needs, it\ncreates frustration and resentment that builds inside of you. Eventually, the relationship becomes so\npainful that you blow up, collapse into depression, or run away. The paradox of being passive is that\nin the short term, giving in seems to protect the relationship. Long term, however, the relationship\ntakes a shape you can\u2019t stand\u2014and you have to destroy it to stop the pain.\nIn comparison, aggressive behaviors also destroy relationships because they push people away.\nAn aggressive interpersonal style derives from two sources. The first is a strong sense of the way\nthings should be. In particular, you are acutely aware of how others ought to behave. You see clearly\nthe right and wrong way to act in each situation. When others act in a way that violates your sense\nof what is appropriate or right, you may feel a strong need to punish them.\nThe second source of aggression is a need to control interpersonal events. Things have to\ngo a certain way, and you expect certain outcomes to happen or not happen. So when the other\nperson either violates your sense of what\u2019s right or fails to do what you expect, anger starts to roil\nup in you. You apply more pressure to control what happens. At times, you may feel so determined\nthat you explode\u2014and drive others away.\nPassivity and aggression both destroy relationships. Either one of these patterns ends up being\nvery painful for you\u2014and those you care for. The assertiveness skills you\u2019ll be introduced to in the\nnext chapter are a middle way. They will give you the tools to seek what you need in relationships,\nset limits, and negotiate conflicts\u2014all without anger or coercive efforts to control.\nExercise: Identify Your Style\nThink back over recent interactions in your five most significant relationships. Place a check (\uf0fc)\nn ex t to the statements that reflect your typical behavior:\n1 . I go along with something, even if I don\u2019t like it.\n2 . I push people to do what\u2019s right, even if there\u2019s an upset.\n3 . I try to be pleasant and easygoing, no matter what people do or say.\n4 . I give people a piece of my mind when they deserve it.\n5 . I always try to be sensitive to what other people need and feel, even if my own needs\nget lost in the process.\n6 . I know what I want and insist on it, even if it means having to get angry.\n7 . When there\u2019s a conflict, I tend to give in and let things go the other person\u2019s way.\nBasic Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 183\n[Page 193]\n8 . When people don\u2019t do what\u2019s appropriate or reasonable, I don\u2019t let them get away\nwith it.\n9 . I\u2019ll pull away from a relationship rather than say anything that could be upsetting.\n10 . You can\u2019t let people continue being selfish or stupid; you have to shake them till they\nsee what they\u2019re doing.\n11 . I leave people alone, let them be whatever they are.\n12 . If people ignore my needs or insist on things that don\u2019t work for me, I get more and\nmore upset till they pay attention.\nIf you tended to mark odd numbers, your predominant style is passive; if you checked even\nnumbers, you may have a tendency to an aggressive problem-solving style.\n\u201cI WANT\u2013THEY WANT\u201d RATIO\nEvery relationship consists of two people trying to get what they need. Sometimes they need the\nsame thing\u2014companionship, recreation, calm, and quiet\u2014and it\u2019s easy. But when they need different things at the same time, or when one of them needs something the other doesn\u2019t want to\ngive, there\u2019s trouble. For relationships to succeed you must be able to do the following:\n\u000e Know and say what you desire.\n\u000e Notice or find out what the other person desires.\n\u000e Negotiate and compromise so you can get at least some of what you want.\n\u000e Give what you can of what the other person wants.\nIf the \u201cI want\u2013they want\u201d ratio isn\u2019t balanced, your relationship becomes unstable. Paying\nattention to what each person desires and using assertiveness skills to negotiate conflicts is vital\nto maintaining healthy relationships.\nExercise: \u201cI Want\u2013They Want\u201d\nThe following exercise will help you assess the \u201cI want\u2013they want\u201d ratio. Choose one relationship you want to evaluate. In the left-hand column, fill in the things you want and need in that\nrelationship.\nUnder \u201cOutcome,\u201d assess how well those needs are met. In the two right-hand columns, do\nthe same for the other person. Now take a look at the outcomes on each side of the chart. Are\nmore of one person or the other\u2019s needs being met? How does the relationship deal with those\nunmet needs? Are they ignored or negotiated? Are they sources of blame or withdrawal?\n184 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 194]\nBasic Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 185\nTNEMSSESSA\n\u201dTNAW\nYEHT\u2013TNAW\nI\u201c\nemoctuO\ntnaW\nyehT\nemoctuO\ntnaW\nI\n[Page 195]\n\u201cI WANT\u2013I SHOuLD\u201d RATIO\nEvery relationship requires keeping a delicate balance between seeking what you want to do and\ndoing what you think you should do (for the good of the relationship or the other person). If\nmost of your focus is directed toward getting and doing what you want with little attention to\nwhat must be done for the other, you\u2019ll soon earn resentment. If you\u2019re overbalanced on the side\nof \u201cshoulds\u201d\u2014how you should act, what you should do for the other person\u2014the relationship will\nbegin to feel like a joyless burden, and you\u2019ll dream of escape.\nFor many, \u201cshoulds\u201d can become a controlling tyranny, forcing them to ignore important\nneeds. They\u2019re so busy being good and giving that they fail to notice how depressed and desperate\nthey\u2019ve become. Sooner or later, the pain of denying yourself grows too big, and you have to escape\nor blow up the relationship.\nExercise: The \u201cShoulds\u201d\nPut a check (\uf0fc) next to the items that describe your beliefs or feelings:\nYou should try to give everything that\u2019s asked of you in a relationship, even when it means\nputting your own needs aside.\nWhen someone is in pain, you should do anything required to help them.\nYou should be caring and considerate at all times.\nYou shouldn\u2019t ask for something if you know the other person doesn\u2019t want to give it.\nThere is a right way to act with people, and it should be followed even if it means keeping\nquiet about your feelings and needs.\nYou shouldn\u2019t say no to people; it\u2019s impolite.\nYou shouldn\u2019t express feelings that might upset someone; it\u2019s wrong.\nYou should respond to the needs of others because their needs are a high priority.\nYou should never hurt or offend anyone.\nYou should try not to disappoint others.\nThe more items you checked, the stronger your beliefs about the right and wrong way to relate\nwith others and the more likely you are to deny your own needs in a relationship. There\u2019s nothing\nwrong with having values about how to treat others, but if those values overpower your ability to\nask for what you want, you\u2019ll end up feeling helpless in any relationship.\n186 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 196]\nSKILL BuILDING\nImproving your interpersonal skills will take hard work. You don\u2019t need anyone to tell you how\ndifficult it is to change relationship patterns. But you know why it\u2019s important\u2014some relationships\nyou value have blown up because you didn\u2019t know how to fix things that went wrong. This chapter\nand the next will give you new tools to manage how you function in relationships. Sometimes\nthey\u2019ll work, sometimes they won\u2019t; and sometimes you may forget to use them. But you\u2019ll also be\namazed how much they can improve a conversation or help to solve a problem.\nIt\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s okay if you fall down sometimes\u2014if you blow up or withdraw\u2014because it\ntakes time to learn a new way. Practicing your new interpersonal skills will yield the following\nresults:\n\u000e Help you be more effective in your dealings with people\n\u000e Improve your ability to get your needs met\n\u000e Help you negotiate conflicts without damaging a relationship\n\u000e Strengthen your self-respect by giving you alternatives to old, damaging patterns\nof anger or withdrawal\nKEY INTERPERSONAL SKILLS\nThere are six core interpersonal skills that will change how your relationships feel:\n1 . Knowing what you want. How do you know what you want in a relationship? In some\ncases, you sense a yearning. Or you\u2019re aware of discomfort. The key is to pay attention\nand look for a way to describe, in your own mind, what you\u2019re feeling.\n2 . Asking for what you want\u2014in a way that protects the relationship. The next chapter will\ngive you an effective method and format for doing this. But for the moment, the basic\nidea is to put your needs into words that are clear, not attacking, and ask for specific\nbehavioral change.\n3 . Negotiating conflicting wants. The willingness to negotiate starts with a clear commitment\nthat there won\u2019t be winners or losers. It assumes that each person\u2019s needs are valid and\nunderstandable, and it draws on a willingness to compromise so that each person gets\nsome of what he or she wants. A simple protocol for negotiating conflicting needs is\nprovided in the next chapter.\n4 . Getting information. One of the most crucial of all interpersonal skills is finding out\nwhat the other person needs, fears, hopes for, and so on. The major blocks to getting\nBasic Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 187\n[Page 197]\ninformation are when you (1) falsely assume you know what the other person wants; (2)\nproject your own fears, needs, and feelings on the other person; (3) fear appearing to\npry; (4) fear hearing the worst possible answer; and (5) don\u2019t know how to ask or what\nto look for. The next chapter will give you some key strategies for getting information.\n5 . Saying no\u2014in a way that protects the relationship. You can say no in three ways: (1) in a\nlimp, powerless style that just gets overridden; (2) in a hard-edged, aggressive style that\nalienates people; or (3) in an assertive style that validates the other person\u2019s needs and\ndesires while setting firm boundaries around what you will and won\u2019t do. The first two\nstrategies undermine relationships because someone is going to end up feeling controlled\nand resentful. We\u2019ll describe how to implement the third strategy in the next chapter.\n6 . Acting according to your values. Being passive or aggressive in a relationship diminishes\nboth your self-respect and the self-respect of others, because someone is losing out in the\nrelationship\u2014someone\u2019s needs and feelings are being ignored. Being clear about how you\nwant to treat others is a critical step to interpersonal effectiveness. Ask yourself, \u201cWhat\ntype of relationships do I want with other people?\u201d Do you want a loving relationship,\na trustworthy relationship, or a committed relationship? Hopefully, as you\u2019ve been using\nthe skills and exercises in this workbook, you\u2019ve begun to think about how you value\nyour relationships. Acting in your relationships according to what you value is another\ncrucial step that will determine the entire nature of your relationships. Don\u2019t be surprised when valueless relationships don\u2019t work out well. Try setting positive intentions\nand values for each of your relationships, and act in those relationships according to\nwhat you\u2019re trying to achieve.\nExercise: Identify Your Interpersonal values\nOn the following lines, list any of your interpersonal behaviors that diminish self-respect. Include\nanything that emotionally damages you or another person. Also write down sins of omission\u2014\nthings you should have done, but didn\u2019t.\nExample: I get angry as soon as someone criticizes me.\nNow, in the space that follows, list your values regarding how people should be treated. These\nare your basic rules about what you and others are entitled to in a relationship.\n188 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 198]\nExample: It\u2019s important to me to hear that someone I love is hurting.\nWhen you compare the two lists, assess whether you\u2019re using interpersonal strategies that\nviolate your values. Which core values do you disregard most frequently? How are your relationships impacted when you violate your values?\nIn the next chapter, you will learn interpersonal strategies that will help you be effective while\nat the same time preserving your self-respect.\nBLOCKS TO uSING INTERPERSONAL SKILLS\nDespite how diligent you are about using your new interpersonal skills, there will still be many\nobstacles along the way that might temporarily block the success of your relationships. But don\u2019t\nworry\u2014identifying these obstacles is half the battle. Once you know what they are, you can prepare\nto overcome them. Here are some of the most common blocks to using interpersonal skills:\n\u000e Old habits\u2014of the aggressive kind\n\u000e Old habits\u2014of the passive kind\n\u000e Overwhelming emotion\n\u000e Failure to identify your needs\n\u000e Fear\n\u000e Toxic relationships\n\u000e Myths\nold Habits\u2014of the Aggressive Kind\nIn your family of origin, you observed how people solved interpersonal problems, and you\nbegan to model your own behavior on what you saw. If members of your family dealt with conflict\nusing anger, blame, or withdrawal, these are the strategies you may have learned to use as well.\nTechniques for influencing others that utilize fear, shame, or hurtful psychological pressure\nare called aversive strategies. There are eight of them:\nBasic Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 189\n[Page 199]\n1 . Discounting: The message to the other person is that his or her needs or feelings are\ninvalid and don\u2019t have legitimacy or importance. Here\u2019s an example: \u201cYou\u2019ve been watching TV all day; why do you expect me to come home and do the bills?\u201d\n2 . Withdrawing/abandoning: The message is \u201cDo what I want or I\u2019m leaving.\u201d The fear of\nabandonment is so powerful that many people will give up a great deal to avoid it.\n3 . Threatening: The message here is \u201cDo what I want or I\u2019ll hurt you.\u201d The most typical\nthreats are to get angry or somehow make the other person\u2019s life miserable. Here\u2019s an\nexample: \u201cHey, okay, I won\u2019t ask you to help me again. Maybe I\u2019ll ask somebody else.\u201d\n4 . Blaming: The problem, whatever it is, becomes the other person\u2019s fault. Since they caused\nit, they have to fix it. Here\u2019s an example: \u201cThe reason we\u2019re running up our credit cards\nevery month is that you never saw a store you didn\u2019t like.\u201d\n5 . Belittling/denigrating: The strategy here is to make the other person feel foolish and wrong\nto have a particular need, opinion, or feeling. Here\u2019s an example: \u201cWhy do you want to\ngo to the lake all the time? All you ever do is get allergy attacks up there.\u201d\n6 . Guilt-tripping: This strategy conveys the message that the other person is a moral failure,\nthat their needs are wrong and must be given up. Here\u2019s an example: \u201cIf you don\u2019t trust\nme, that tells me something is very wrong with our relationship.\u201d\n7 . Derailing: This strategy switches attention away from the other person\u2019s feelings and\nneeds. The idea is to stop talking about them and instead talk about yourself. Here\u2019s an\nexample: \u201cI don\u2019t care what you want to do, right now I feel hurt.\u201d\n8 . Taking away: Here the strategy is to withdraw some form of support, pleasure, or reinforcement from the other person as punishment for something they said, did, or wanted.\nHere\u2019s an example: John said, \u201cI\u2019m not really in the mood for hiking; it\u2019s boring,\u201d after\nhis partner was unwilling to invest in a new camera (adapted from McKay, Fanning, &\nPaleg, 1994).\nAs you review this list, are there strategies you recognize from your own behavior? Think back\nto times you\u2019ve used aversive tactics\u2014what was the impact on your relationship? Is this something\nyou want to change? The best way to stop aversive behavior is to observe it closely.\nExercise: Conflict Log\nThe following Conflict Log will help you.\n190 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 200]\nBasic Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 191\nGOL\nTCILFNOC\nsecneuqesnoC\nygetartS\nevisrevA\nroivaheB\nyM\ndeeN\nyM\netaD\n[Page 201]\nold Habits\u2014of the Passive Kind\nSome old habits are of the passive rather than aggressive variety. You may have learned in\nyour family how to shut down or surrender when there is a conflict. You can use the same Conflict\nLog (using \u201cPassive Strategy\u201d rather than \u201cAversive Strategy\u201d in column four to track conflicts\nwhen you withdraw or shut down.\nAfter keeping the log, ask these questions:\n\u000e What kind of needs or situations trigger your use of aversive or passive strategies?\n\u000e Which strategies do you most frequently rely on?\n\u000e Are you getting what you want using aversive or passive strategies?\n\u000e What are the most frequent emotional consequences for using these strategies?\nThe assertiveness skills in the next chapter will give you more effective alternatives to the\naversive and passive responses you\u2019ve typically used.\noverwhelming emotion\nA third major block to using interpersonal skills is high emotion. Sometimes your best intentions and most carefully laid plans go up in smoke when you\u2019re upset. For some people, particularly\nthose who have grown up in abusive homes, getting angry can cause a dissociative fugue state. In\nthat frame of mind, they may do or say things that, on later reflection, seem to have been done\nby someone else. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like me telling my wife to get out,\u201d one man insisted. \u201cI felt like I\nwas possessed, in the control of some force outside myself.\u201d\nThere is good evidence that angry, dissociative states are responsible for a lot of emotional\nand even physical violence. What can you do when overwhelming emotion threatens to unravel\nyour hard-won interpersonal skills? There are two things you can learn to do right now. First,\npay attention to the red flags that indicate you\u2019re starting to lose control. Different people have\ndifferent signals. Here are some that are typical:\n\u000e Feeling hot or flushed\n\u000e Heart pounding\n\u000e Short of breath\n\u000e Tension in your hands, arms, forehead, or shoulders\n\u000e Talking more rapidly or more loudly than usual\n\u000e Feeling a strong need to win, to crush someone, to make them feel bad\n192 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 202]\nExercise: Red-Flag Feelings and Behaviors\nMake a list in the following space of red-flag feelings or behaviors that in the past signaled a loss\nof control:\nNow when conflicts arise, watch out for the red flags. If you notice them, you can use a second\ntechnique you\u2019ve already learned: When you first notice that you\u2019re beginning to get overwhelmed\nby your emotions, start using your mindful breathing skills (see page 80). Take slow, diaphragmatic\nbreaths, and put all of your attention on the physical experience of the breath. This will help to\ncalm you and to disconnect the old neural pathways that made you feel overwhelmed.\nfailure to Identify Your needs\nInterpersonal skills won\u2019t do you much good if you don\u2019t know what you want in a situation.\nIf you can\u2019t clearly articulate your needs, all you\u2019re left with is frustration. The first section of the\nnext chapter will offer you strategies for identifying what you want in terms of specific behavioral\nchange from others. Once you can articulate a need to yourself, the sections on assertiveness and\nmaking a simple request will give you tools to say it out loud.\nfear\nWhen you feel afraid of something, interpersonal skills often go out the window. You\u2019re just\ntoo full of catastrophic \u201cwhat ifs\u201d to think clearly. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m rejected? What if I lose my job?\nWhat if I can\u2019t stand this?\u201d Catastrophic thoughts can scare you into using aggressive and aversive\nstrategies. Or they can cause you to avoid a situation altogether. The net result is that you don\u2019t\nfunction well and aren\u2019t effective.\nWise-mind meditation (see page 87) can help you manage in the face of fear, as can mindful\nbreathing. Another thing you can do is directly confront your catastrophic thoughts. There are\ntwo steps to this.\nBasic Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 193\n[Page 203]\nExercise 1: Risk Assessment\nNotice that the Risk Assessment/Risk Planning Worksheet on the next page is divided into four\ncolumns. In column one, write down your fear, and in column two list all the evidence you have\nthat the fear will come true. In column three, write down all available evidence that the catastrophe won\u2019t occur. Now, after reviewing evidence for and against, write your estimate of the percentage of chance that the catastrophe will happen.\nExercise 2: Risk Planning\nIn the \u201cRisk Planning\u201d portion of the worksheet, imagine that the catastrophe you fear has actually happened. How would you cope? Do you have resources, family, or friends to help you? Do\nyou have a plan for how you would do your best with the situation? What skills do you have to\nget you through?\nThe Risk Assessment/Risk Planning Worksheet is something you may want to photocopy and\nuse again and again\u2014whenever fear threatens to torpedo your relationship skills.\n194 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 204]\nRISK ASSESSMENT\nMy Fear Evidence For Evidence Against Percentage\nof Chance of\nOccurring\nRISK PLANNING\nMake a coping plan utilizing your skills and resources in the event your feared scenario comes\ntrue.\n1 .\n2 .\n3 .\n4 .\n5 .\n6 .\nBasic Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 195\n[Page 205]\nToxic Relationships\nRelationships where people use aversive strategies on you can make your interpersonal skills\nvery difficult to use. No matter how determined you are to be assertive rather than aggressive or\npassive, people who blame, threaten, or belittle you can often trip you up and make you want to\nexplode or run away.\nThe best solution is to get away from these folks. They\u2019re not going to change, and you\u2019ll\nnever stop being vulnerable to their attacks. However, if these are people you can\u2019t avoid\u2014for\nexample, a boss or a family member\u2014there are two things you must do to cope. First, you have\nto calm yourself before dealing with them. Use mindful breathing or wise mind to get centered.\nSecond, based on past experience, you need to anticipate exactly how the toxic individual is likely\nto act, and then you need to make a specific plan\u2014even a script\u2014to deal with it. Planning ahead\nand developing a detailed response will keep you from falling back on old, ineffective patterns.\nSee the assertiveness sections in the next chapter for the tools necessary to talk your way out of\naversive traps.\nmyths\nThe last of the major blocks to using interpersonal skills is found in the four paralyzing myths\nof relationship:\n1 . If I need something, it means there is something wrong or bad about me.\n2 . I won\u2019t be able to stand it if the other person gets mad or says no.\n3 . It\u2019s selfish to say no or ask for things.\n4 . I have no control over anything.\nEach of these myths inhibits you from saying what you need and setting limits. Let\u2019s look at\neach of them.\n\u000e Myth #1. Every human being needs things from other human beings\u2014whether it\u2019s\nattention, support, love, help, or just plain kindness. We are not sufficient unto\nourselves, and our whole lives are spent negotiating with others for everything we\nrequire to survive\u2014physically and emotionally. So needing things can\u2019t be shameful or wrong; it is basic to the human condition. In contrast to this myth, a healthy\nalternative coping thought is \u201cI have a right to want things.\u201d\n\u000e Myth #2. Hearing an angry refusal hurts. Sometimes it hits so hard and suddenly\nthat it takes your breath away. But is it true you can\u2019t stand it? Think of the\nrejections you\u2019ve suffered in your life\u2014they were difficult, but you survived them.\nRefusals hurt, there\u2019s no doubt about it, but the worst thing is living with years\n196 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 206]\nof pain because you never asked for what you want. In contrast to this myth, a\nhealthy alternative coping thought is \u201cI have a right to ask for things\u2014even if the\nother person won\u2019t give them.\u201d\n\u000e Myth #3. You may feel that it\u2019s selfish to ask for things because of messages in your\nearly family that said your needs didn\u2019t count or that your needs were less important than the needs of others. When you examine it, is this really true? Is there\nsomething flawed or wrong with you that makes your needs relatively unimportant?\nThe truth is that everyone\u2019s needs are valid, and equally important. It isn\u2019t selfish\nto ask for things or set limits. It\u2019s normal. It\u2019s healthy and necessary. Our survival\nas individuals depends on knowing and saying what we want. Because if we don\u2019t,\nfolks don\u2019t pay attention. A helpful coping thought is \u201cIt\u2019s normal and healthy to\nask for things.\u201d\n\u000e Myth #4. Control is relative. You can\u2019t control the behavior of others, even though\nsome folks go nuts trying. What can be controlled is your behavior. Passive or\naggressive styles often have bad outcomes. People ignore your needs or get angry\nand resist you. That\u2019s why you feel helpless\u2014the strategies you\u2019re using aren\u2019t effective. Assertive behavior gets better results. People\u2014more often than not\u2014listen and\nrespond positively. In contrast to this myth, a helpful alternative coping thought is\n\u201cI can choose to behave in more effective ways.\u201d\nBasic Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 197\n[Page 207] [Page 208]\nchapter 9\nAdvanced Interpersonal\nEffectiveness Skills\nThis chapter contains all the applied skills of interpersonal effectiveness. Learning and practicing\nthese skills will change your life because you\u2019ll have far less conflict and far more rewards in your\nrelationships. Your connections to people will feel different\u2014more satisfying than frustrating and\nmore supportive than depriving. In this chapter, you\u2019ll learn the following specific skills:\n\u000e Knowing what you want\n\u000e Modulating intensity\n\u000e Making a simple request\n\u000e Making basic assertiveness scripts\n\u000e Using assertive listening skills\n\u000e Saying no\n\u000e Coping with resistance and conflict\n\u000e Negotiating\n\u000e Analyzing problem interactions\nKNOWING WHAT YOu WANT\nInterpersonal effectiveness has to begin with self-knowledge. You need to be clear about what\nyou feel and want. Chapters 6 and 7 on emotion regulation will give you words for the nuances\n[Page 209]\nof what you feel and techniques to classify the emotion. For our purposes here, you can identify\nemotions through a simple decision-making process called a decision tree. It starts with the basic\nquestions\u2014is the feeling good or bad, painful or pleasurable? If the feeling is good, is it more like\nsatisfaction, excitement, sexual attraction, love/affection, contentment, joy, pleasant anticipation,\ninterest, or satiety? If the feeling is bad, is it more like anxiety, fear, anger, resentment, sadness,\ngrief/loss, hurt, anger or disgust with oneself, embarrassment/shame, guilt, yearning/deprivation, or\nloneliness/emptiness? The decision tree looks like this:\neMotIons\nGood Bad\nSatisfaction Anxiety (for the future)\nExcitement Fear (of something now)\nSexual attraction Anger\nLove/affection Resentment\nContentment Sadness\nJoy Grief/loss\nPleasant anticipation Hurt\nInterest Anger or disgust with oneself\nSatiety Embarrassment/shame\nGuilt\nYearning/deprivation\nLoneliness/emptiness\nAllan, for example, was aware that something felt wrong in his relationship with his father.\nWhen he looked at the list of feelings, the one that seemed closest was hurt\u2014with a little bit of\nresentment. Allan could tell it somehow related to his father\u2019s planned visit. The man was coming\nto town with his new wife. Yet, in five days of sightseeing, his dad had scheduled just a single\ndinner with Allan. Once you can put words to what you feel, the next question becomes, what does\nthis emotion make you want to change? And, more specifically, what is the behavior of others that\nyou want to modify? Do you want them to do more or less of something? Do you want something\nto stop? Do you want new behavior that could make a difference in how you feel?\nNow think about the behavior change in specific terms. When and where do you want to see\nthis change? How often? What exactly would the new behavior look like?\nNow let\u2019s condense this process into a series of steps.\n200 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 210]\nExercise: Knowing What You Want\nThink of a recent experience where you had a bad feeling during an interaction. Getting from the\nfeeling to a clear statement of desire would involve the following process:\n1 . Put the feeling into words:\n2 . What do you want the other person to change?\n\u000e More of\n\u000e Less of\n\u000e Stop doing\n\u000e Start doing\n\u000e When\n\u000e Where\n\u000e Frequency\nNow put all this information into one or more clear sentences:\nA woman whose sister frequently criticized how she parented a difficult child wrote this\ndescription of what she wanted changed: \u201cI\u2019d like Brenda to stop talking about Mike [my son]\nand stop talking about my \u2018needing a backbone\u2019 with him. I\u2019d like her to stop it, in particular,\nwhen we\u2019re around people we know. Instead, I\u2019d rather she ask me about other things\u2014work, my\nphotographs, my writing.\u201d\nThe problem with getting clear and specific about your desires is that it brings up anxiety.\nDo you deserve to ask for things? Do you dare trouble people with your needs? Are you allowed to\ndisappoint, to annoy, to push people to make an effort on your behalf? The answer is yes. And the\nreason is that you are a human being who feels, who yearns for things, who hurts, who struggles\nwith moments of pain. All of this entitles you to be heard.\nUnfortunately, many people grow up in families that invalidate their needs. And all their lives\nthey feel afraid to ask for things\u2014as if they were bad or undeserving, as if their feelings and pain\nhad no importance.\nAdvanced Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 201\n[Page 211]\nTo remind you of your value and importance as a human being, we\u2019d like you to review the\nfollowing list of legitimate rights (adapted from McKay et al., 1983).\nyour legItIMate rIghts\n1 . You have a right to need things from others.\n2 . You have a right to put yourself first sometimes.\n3 . You have a right to feel and express your emotions or your pain.\n4 . You have the right to be the final judge of your beliefs and accept them as legitimate.\n5 . You have the right to your opinions and convictions.\n6 . You have the right to your experience\u2014even if it\u2019s different from that of other people.\n7 . You have a right to protest any treatment or criticism that feels bad to you.\n8 . You have a right to negotiate for change.\n9 . You have a right to ask for help, emotional support, or anything else you need (even\nthough you may not always get it).\n10 . You have a right to say no; saying no doesn\u2019t make you bad or selfish.\n11 . You have a right not to justify yourself to others.\n12 . You have a right not to take responsibility for someone else\u2019s problem.\n13 . You have a right to choose not to respond to a situation.\n14 . You have a right, sometimes, to inconvenience or disappoint others.\nPut the rights that are most important or liberating to you on a file card, and tape it someplace where you\u2019ll see it frequently, like your bathroom mirror, in order to remind yourself.\nMODuLATING INTENSITY\nHow you ask for things depends on the situation. The intensity and level of insistence can vary\nbased on two major factors:\n1 . How urgent is my need?\nLow urgency 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 High urgency\n202 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 212]\n2 . How vulnerable is the other person or the relationship?\nVery vulnerable 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Not vulnerable\nNotice that you can assess each of these variables with a ten-point scale. The higher the total\nnumber, the more forceful it\u2019s appropriate to be. The lower the number, the more moderate and\ngentle you should be.\nExercise: Modulating Intensity\nThink of some recent situations where you\u2019ve needed another person to change. Evaluate them\nusing these two key questions and the scoring method. What can you learn about the appropriate\nlevel of intensity and pressure? Did you use too much\u2014or too little\u2014in certain situations? Imagine\nwhat might have happened if you\u2019d adjusted the intensity of your request based on (1) the urgency\nof need and (2) the level of vulnerability criteria.\nAsk yourself these two questions during every situation where you need to express yourself.\nWhile you may not always have the time or inclination to use the 1 to 10 rating system, remembering \u201chow urgent?\u201d and \u201chow vulnerable?\u201d can help you make split-second decisions about how\nmuch strength, hardness, and volume to put into your voice.\nDuring this exercise, Rachel evaluated some problematic discussions with her husband. One,\nin particular, had been very frustrating because she wanted him to attend a parent-teacher conference that was scheduled for 3:00\u2014a time when he\u2019d have to miss work. Her husband refused. But\ntheir son was having reading problems, and Rachel rated the urgency at an 8, while her husband\u2019s\nvulnerability was rated 7\u2014not very vulnerable. Rachel realized that her gentle, easygoing approach\nhad been a mistake.\nMAKING A SIMPLE REQuEST\nThe skill of making a request is necessary to taking care of yourself. Asking for directions, asking\nto change tables at a restaurant, asking your mechanic to show you the parts he replaced on your\ncar, asking someone not to smoke in your house\u2014these requests are all about self-protection and\nquality of life. If you have trouble making such requests, you can easily end up feeling helpless or\nresentful.\nThere are four components to a brief request:\n1 . A brief justification (optional). Explain in one sentence what the problem is. \u201cIt\u2019s hot in\nhere \u2026 These bags are heavy \u2026 It\u2019s a long way to walk \u2026 These seem a little tight.\u201d\nMany situations don\u2019t need any justification; when they do, keep it simple.\n2 . A softening statement. This is an important piece because it establishes you as a reasonable person who\u2019s polite and nondemanding. Softening statements often start like this.\nAdvanced Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 203\n[Page 213]\n\u000e \u201cWould you mind if \u2026\u201d\n\u000e \u201cIt would be helpful if you could \u2026\u201d\n\u000e \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you would \u2026\u201d\n\u000e (Said with a smile) \u201cCould I have \u2026\u201d\n\u000e \u201cHi, I was wondering if \u2026\u201d\nNotice that these openers are disarming. They\u2019re far less likely to encounter resistance than a hard-edged demand.\n3 . A direct, specific question. You say what you want clearly and exactly. Leave any charge\nor emotion out of your voice. Say what you want in a flat, matter-of fact-way. Don\u2019t\nblame or imply that anything\u2019s wrong with the other person. Present your request as\nnormal and reasonable\u2014something that anyone would be glad to accommodate. Keep\nthe question to one sentence if you can\u2014the more you elaborate and explain, the more\nresistance you\u2019ll tend to run into.\n4 . An appreciation statement. This reinforces the behavior of the other person saying yes to\nyou. It makes them feel that you value what they\u2019re doing. Here are some examples:\n\u000e \u201cThis will really help me out.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cThanks for your effort with this.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cThis will make a real difference.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cThis is much appreciated.\u201d\nWhen the components are strung together, simple requests can look like these:\n\u000e In a restaurant: \u201cThe sun\u2019s really bright. Would you mind lowering the shade a\nlittle? Thanks so much.\u201d\n\u000e In a subway car: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit tight here. Could you please move your briefcase off the\nseat to make some room? I really appreciate it.\u201d\n\u000e Driving with a friend: \u201cI\u2019m nervous to drive this close, especially at this speed.\nWould it be okay with you to leave a little more room between us and the car in\nfront? Thanks for indulging me on this one.\u201d\n204 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 214]\nExercise: Making a Simple Request\nIf you sometimes find making requests challenging, you can practice in lots of everyday situations.\nTry some of these suggestions:\n\u000e On the street: Asking for the time, for directions, where someone bought a particular article of clothing, for change.\n\u000e In stores: Asking to examine merchandise, for information (for example, a return\npolicy), to see something less expensive or in a different color, for advice regarding\na purchase (for example, \u201cDo these colors go together?\u201d), for change.\n\u000e At work: Asking for information, for a little bit of help, for an extended deadline,\nfor a moment of someone\u2019s time, for an opinion.\n\u000e At home: Asking for a change in schedule, for assistance, for time together, for\nhelp changing the environment (\u201cWould you mind if we moved this chair to the\nkitchen?\u201d).\n\u000e With friends and family: Asking for a favor, for time, for a ride, for someone to stop\nsomething that\u2019s annoying.\n\u000e With a teacher or therapist: Asking for information, for help with a problem, for\nadvice.\nIf you plan to work on this skill, choose one of the above options (or develop ones of your\nown) to work on each day. Either at breakfast or just before going to bed, identify the next day\u2019s\nchallenge. Decide on the time and situation in which you plan to practice. Write it in your calendar\nto help you remember. Then do it.\nASSERTIvENESS SCRIPTS\nAs you read in the last chapter, assertiveness is a critical skill to maintaining healthy relationships.\nWithout it, you\u2019ll be forced into passive or aggressive patterns that destroy the fabric of trust and\nintimacy.\nAssertiveness is most easily learned by using a simple script. It will help you give structure to\nwhat you want to say and keep you focused. A script also has the advantage of permitting you to\ndevelop a statement in advance, practicing it by yourself or with someone you trust, and finally (at\na time you choose) delivering it with greater confidence.\nThere are three basic components to an assertiveness statement and one optional\ncomponent.\nAdvanced Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 205\n[Page 215]\n1 . \u201cI think.\u201d This part focuses on the facts and your understanding of what\u2019s going on. It\nshould not include judgments or assumptions about the other person\u2019s motives. It should\nnot in any way attack. \u201cI think\u201d is a clear description of events and experiences that you\nneed to talk about\u2014and perhaps change. Here are some examples:\n\u000e \u201cI think we haven\u2019t spent much time together lately\u2014two nights last week,\none the week before.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cYou\u2019ve billed me for a repair I didn\u2019t authorize.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cLooking back at the recent past, I think you\u2019ve been late for the majority of\nour meetings.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cI'm getting back from the airport late\u2014around 11:00 o\u2019clock\u2014and \u2026\u201d\nNotice that there isn\u2019t much hint of emotion in these statements, and there\u2019s no\ndisapproval in the statement of facts.\n2 . \u201cI feel.\u201d This is an optional component that you\u2019d likely use with a friend or family\nmember but not with your garage mechanic. The purpose is to give a brief, nonpejorative description of any emotion triggered by the situation. Communication specialists\ncall this component of assertiveness the \u201cI\u201d statement. That\u2019s because it\u2019s about you and\nyour particular feelings. Appropriately, any sentence about your emotions should start\nwith \u201cI.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cI feel scared.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cI feel lonely.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cLately, I feel sad about us.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cI feel hurt, with a twinge of giving up.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cI feel kind of lost and invisible and more and more disconnected.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cI feel rejected.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cI feel hopeful but nervous.\u201d\nEach example, while naming feelings of varied complexity, never makes the other\nperson bad or wrong. That doesn\u2019t work\u2014it just makes people defensive and less willing\nto give you anything. Accusations and blame statements often start with the word\n\u201cyou\u201d\u2014so they\u2019re called \u201cyou\u201d statements.\n\u000e \u201cYou\u2019re hurting me.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cYou don\u2019t care about us.\u201d\n206 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 216]\n\u000e \u201cYou\u2019re always late.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cYou\u2019re ruining our business.\u201d\nSome people dress up \u201cyou\u201d statements to look like \u201cI\u201d statements. This charade is\nusually obvious because the sentence starts, \u201cI feel that you \u2026\u201d\n\u000e \u201cI feel that you\u2019re selfish.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cI feel that you\u2019re never home.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cI feel that you manipulate me.\u201d\nNotice that a judgment, not a feeling, forms the core of such communications. It\u2019s\ncertainly safer than an \u201cI\u201d statement\u2014because the speaker is less vulnerable\u2014but it\ncommunicates nothing about your emotional experience.\n3 . \u201cI want.\u201d This component is the whole point of assertiveness, and you need to think it\nthrough carefully. Here are some guidelines to follow:\n\u000e Ask for behavioral, not attitudinal, change. You can\u2019t reasonably expect someone\nto change what they believe or feel just because you don\u2019t like it. Beliefs\nand feelings aren\u2019t usually in voluntary control. But you can ask someone to\nchange how they act and what they do.\n\u000e Ask for one change at a time. Don\u2019t give a laundry list. That overwhelms people\nand makes them feel pressured.\n\u000e Ask for something that can be changed now. \u201cThe next time we go on vacation,\nI want you to \u2026\u201d is a poor \u201cI want\u201d statement because it\u2019ll be long forgotten\nwhen the next vacation finally arrives.\n\u000e Be specific and concrete. Vague requests like \u201cBe nicer\u201d don\u2019t get you anywhere\nbecause nobody has a very clear picture of what they mean. Describe what\nnew behavior you expect, and say when and where you\u2019d want it to occur.\nAsking someone for twenty minutes of help doing research on the Internet is\nmore effective than requesting \u201ctechnological assistance.\u201d\n4 . Self-care solution (optional): Just asking for things isn\u2019t always enough. Sometimes you need\nto give people encouragement (reinforcement) before they\u2019re motivated to do something\nfor you. The encouragement that works best is a fourth (optional) component of your\nassertive script called the self-care solution. This amounts to nothing more than telling\nthe other person what you\u2019ll do to take care of yourself if they don\u2019t comply with your\nrequest. The self-care solution isn\u2019t the same thing as threatening someone or punishing\nthem. Its purpose is to give information and show that you\u2019re not helpless, that you have\na plan to solve the problem. Here are some examples.\nAdvanced Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 207\n[Page 217]\n\u000e \u201cIf you can\u2019t leave for the party on time, I\u2019ll take my own car.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cIf you can\u2019t help with the cleaning, I\u2019ll hire a maid and we\u2019ll divide that\nexpense.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cIf you can\u2019t find a way to keep the party noise down, I\u2019ll ask the police to\nhelp you.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cIf you want to drive without insurance, I\u2019ll transfer the title to your name\nand you can take over the payments as well.\u201d\nNone of these self-care solutions are designed to hurt the other person; they\u2019re\nabout protecting your rights and taking care of your own needs.\nIntegrating the Components of Being Assertive\nNow, let\u2019s integrate the components of an assertive statement so you can see how they fit\ntogether. Here are some examples:\nexaMple #1\nI think: It\u2019s been three years since we\u2019ve had a cost-of-living raise, and prices have increased more\nthan 10 percent in that time.\nI feel: I feel left out, because the company\u2019s doing well and I\u2019m not participating in that.\nI want: I\u2019d like a 10 percent cost-of-living adjustment soon so my income can keep pace with\ninflation.\nSelf-care: If we can\u2019t work this out, I\u2019m going to have to look for something else so I can better\nsupport my family.\nexaMple #2\nI think: I\u2019ve been working against a deadline tonight and haven\u2019t had time to cook dinner.\nI feel: I\u2019m pretty anxious and overwhelmed that I might not get this done.\nI want: Could you whip something together from leftovers so I can keep going?\nSelf-care: If that doesn\u2019t work for you, I can order a pizza.\nOne way to use your self-care solution is to hold it in reserve\u2014only using it if the other person\nrefuses your preferred solution. Saving the \u201cbig guns\u201d for later is often an effective strategy.\n208 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 218]\nExercise: Developing Your Own Assertiveness Scripts\nNow it\u2019s time to practice developing your own scripts. Start with identifying three situations in\nwhich something feels wrong and you want things to change. Write the information down in the\nspace provided.\nproBleM #1\n1 . The problem:\n2 . What I want changed:\nproBleM #2\n1 . The problem:\n2 . What I want changed:\nproBleM #3\n1 . The problem:\n2 . What I want changed:\nAdvanced Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 209\n[Page 219]\nNow let\u2019s turn this knowledge into actual scripts:\nproBleM #1\nI think:\nI feel:\nI want:\nHow I\u2019ll take care of myself:\nproBleM #2\nI think:\nI feel:\nI want:\nHow I\u2019ll take care of myself:\nproBleM #3\nI think:\nI feel:\n210 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 220]\nI want:\nHow I\u2019ll take care of myself:\nASSERTIvE LISTENING\nEveryone knows that good communication is a two-way street. But what a lot of people don\u2019t know\nis that listening is an active rather than passive process. It requires a full commitment to really\nunderstand what the other person thinks and feels about the problem, and wants to do to change\nit. In other words, the same three things you\u2019re learning to express assertively, you\u2019ll also need to\nlisten for and elicit with questions.\nIf, while listening, you have any uncertainty about the other person\u2019s feelings or wishes, ask a\ndirect question. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure how you feel about that\u2014could you tell me more?\u201d \u201cWhat do\nyou think we should try to change in this situation?\u201d\nThe more active your questions, the more you learn and the better equipped you\u2019ll be to\nfind solutions and compromises that serve both people\u2019s needs. Key questions to ask others are as\nfollows:\n\u000e \u201cWhat\u2019s the central problem, as you understand it?\u201d\n\u000e \u201cHow do you make sense of the situation? What do you think\u2019s happening?\u201d\n\u000e \u201cWhen you\u2019re struggling with (name the problem) , how does it\nmake you feel?\u201d\n\u000e \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with (name the problem) , what does\nit make you want to do?\u201d\n\u000e \u201cWhat do you think needs to change?\u201d\n\u000e \u201cWhat would you like me to do to help with this?\u201d\nFor example, Ron noticed that a coworker seemed irritated with a new order-processing system\nRon had just initiated. When Ron asked, \u201cWhat do you think needs to change?\u201d he got a wealth\nof helpful feedback, and the whole emotional climate changed.\nAssertive listening is extremely valuable, but remember\u2014just because you found out what\nsomeone needs, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to give it to them.\nAdvanced Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 211\n[Page 221]\nBlocks to listening\nHere are ten ways that people sabotage their effective listening abilities (adapted from McKay\net al., 1983). Right now, put a check (\uf0fc) by the listening blocks you\u2019re aware of using. But don\u2019t\njudge yourself\u2014everybody does some of this.\nMind reading: Assuming you know what the other person feels and thinks\u2014without\nasking.\nRehearsing: Planning what you want to say next and missing what\u2019s being said now.\nFiltering: Listening only to things that are important or relevant to you and ignoring\nthe rest (even if it\u2019s important to the other person).\nJudging: Evaluating the other person and what they say rather than really trying to\nunderstand how they see the world.\nDaydreaming: Getting caught in memories or fantasies while someone is talking to\nyou.\nAdvising: Looking for suggestions and solutions instead of listening and\nunderstanding.\nSparring: Invalidating the other person by arguing and debating.\nBeing right: Resisting or ignoring any communication that suggests you are wrong or\nshould change.\nDerailing: Flat out changing the subject as soon as you hear anything that bothers or\nthreatens you.\nPlacating: Agreeing too quickly (\u201cI know \u2026 You\u2019re right \u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u201d) without really\nlistening to the other person\u2019s feelings or concerns.\nExercise: Listening Blocks\nIn the left-hand column of the following table, describe three situations where communications\nbroke down between you and someone else. In the right-hand column, see if you can identify at\nleast one of the listening blocks that kept you from hearing or understanding everything that was\nsaid.\n212 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 222]\nLISTENING-BLOCK ExERCISE\nSituation Blocks to Listening\n1 .\n2 .\n3 .\nDuring the next week, notice how often you use your favorite listening blocks. Commit to\nreplacing them with assertive listening (see key questions under Assertive Listening on page 211).\nSAYING NO\nThe ability to say no is a vital part of healthy communication. Without it, any relationship is\ndangerous\u2014it\u2019s like getting in a car with a gas pedal and no brakes. You have no control over\nwhat people do to you.\nSaying no is simple and hard at the same time. The words are simple, but often it takes\ncourage to say them. Let\u2019s start with the \u201chow\u201d of saying no. There are only two steps:\n1 . Validate the other person\u2019s needs or desires.\n2 . State a clear preference not to do it.\nHere are some examples:\n\u000e \u201cAction movies with a high body count are a lot of fun, but I\u2019d prefer something\ncalmer tonight.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cI\u2019ve seen chartreuse used to good advantage\u2014it\u2019s a dynamic color\u2014but I\u2019d prefer\nsomething pastel in the bedroom.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cI can see why you want to confront Ian (our son), but I don\u2019t feel comfortable with\nan approach that risks him turning his back on us.\u201d\nAdvanced Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 213\n[Page 223]\n\u000e \u201cI can see why you want to go late, out of the hot sun, but I\u2019m not comfortable trying\nto stay up so long after my bedtime.\u201d\nNotice that the key phrases are \u201cI\u2019d prefer\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable.\u201d You don\u2019t offer a lot\nof justification for your position; you don\u2019t argue. You just validate and decline. The important\nthing is not giving the other person anything to use against you. No one can really argue with\npreferences or feelings.\nExercise: Building an Assertive Hierarchy\nLearning assertiveness (including saying no) takes practice and willingness to take some risks. But\nyou need to get your feet wet in low-risk situations, then work toward more anxiety-provoking\nencounters.\nMake a list of situations where you want to make a change, say no, or set limits. Include\nproblems with family, friends, people who work for or with you, authorities, and so on. Now rank\nthe list from 1 to 10 in terms of risk and difficulty, with 1 being the least challenging and 10 being\nthe most challenging situation.\nASSERTIvE SITuATION HIERARCHY\nRank Situation\n214 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 224]\nNow start with the lowest-ranked situations and do four things:\n1 . Write your script (\u201cI think \u2026 I feel \u2026 I want\u201d).\n2 . Rehearse your script.\n3 . Identify the time and place you want to use it.\n4 . Commit yourself to making your assertive statement on a specific date.\nWhen you\u2019ve completed your first assertive goal, evaluate what worked and what needs improvement. For example, do you need to be firmer, with less arguing or excuse making? Whatever you\nlearned from your first step, incorporate it into the preparations for the second-ranked situation.\nKeep moving up the hierarchy. As you do, you\u2019ll find your confidence and skill growing. And your\nrelationships will become gradually more rewarding.\nCOPING WITH RESISTANCE AND CONFLICT\nWe looked earlier at how to improve your ability to hear others. But what happens if someone isn\u2019t\nlistening to you? The answer is in the following five conflict management skills:\n1 . Mutual validation\n2 . Broken record\n3 . Probing\n4 . Clouding (assertive agreement)\n5 . Assertive delay\nmutual Validation\nWhen people aren\u2019t listening to you, one of the most common reasons is that they feel invalidated. They don\u2019t experience that they\u2019re being heard, so they keep pouring on their arguments\nand assertions. You can short-circuit the problem with mutual validation. Validating someone\ndoesn\u2019t mean agreeing with them. It means, instead, that you understand their needs, feelings, and\nmotivations. You get it\u2014you see how the other person could think and feel that way.\nThus mutual validation means you acknowledge and appreciate their experience, you understand where they\u2019re coming from, and then you validate your own experience as well. Here are\nsome examples:\n\u000e \u201cI understand that it\u2019s scary to take a financial risk like this; you have every right to\nbe cautious. On my end, I feel a pressure to make some higher-yield investments so\nAdvanced Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 215\n[Page 225]\nwe\u2019ll have a bit more when we retire. We\u2019re both coming from a reasonable place,\njust different.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cI understand that my saying you\u2019re not pulling your weight hurt you. That would\nbe hard for anyone\u2014me included\u2014to hear. On my end, I\u2019m scared this project is\nin danger of going over budget and I\u2019ll have to answer for that. I need everyone\nto pull together.\u201d\n\u000e \u201cI understand you\u2019re concerned about my safety, and that\u2019s why you replaced the\npart. I appreciate that very much. On my end, I\u2019ve got a budget so tight I can\u2019t\nafford repair work that isn\u2019t literally keeping the car running. Safety isn\u2019t my highest\nconcern right now.\u201d\nNotice that each example of mutual validation includes a sentence that starts \u201cI understand,\u201d\nand another one that begins \u201cOn my end.\u201d These two sentences establish that you appreciate both\npoints of view.\nBroken Record\nYou use this technique when someone isn\u2019t getting the message. Formulate a short, specific,\neasy-to-understand statement about what you want. Ideally, keep it to one sentence. Offer no\nexcuses or explanations. Stand or sit straight, talk in a strong, firm voice. Then just keep repeating\nthe statement as many times as necessary, varying a word here or there\u2014but not much else.\nDon\u2019t argue, don\u2019t get angry, and don\u2019t try to debate or refute anything the other person says.\nDon\u2019t answer any \u201cwhy\u201d questions (\u201cWhy do you want to . . .\u201d) because that just gives the other\nperson ammunition for their arguments. Respond by saying \u201cI just prefer it\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s just how I\nfeel.\u201d Under no circumstances should you offer additional information or evidence for your point\nof view. Just repeat, politely and clearly, like a broken record. Here\u2019s an example:\nSam: Your tree has a large branch suspended over my roof. I\u2019m concerned that the\nnext big storm could bring it down on my house. I\u2019d like you to get an arborist\nto cut off the limb.\nBill: It\u2019s been like that for years; I wouldn\u2019t worry about it.\nSam: I think that branch is a danger to my house, and I\u2019d like you to have it removed.\nBill: Relax; that branch will still be up there long after we\u2019re pushing up daisies.\nSam: It\u2019s hanging over my roof, and I\u2019m concerned about it. I\u2019m asking you to remove\nit, Bill, before it falls.\nBill: Why have you gotten so nervous about it all of a sudden?\nSam: The branch is over my roof, Bill, and it needs to come down.\n216 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 226]\nProbing\nThe key phrase here is this:\n\u000e \u201cWhat is it about (name the situation) that\nbothers you?\u201d\nJust keep asking it until you get something useful.\nFor example, let\u2019s return to a previous example of a person who was accused of not pulling\nhis weight. Imagine that you were criticized in that way. Here\u2019s how probing could help you.\nCritic: You\u2019re not pulling your weight around here.\nYou: What is it about my work that bothers you?\nCritic: Everybody else is working overtime. You waltz out every night at 5:00.\nYou: What is it that bothers you about me leaving the office on time?\nCritic: The work has to be done. I\u2019m responsible to see that it is. And you just work by\nthe clock.\nYou: What is it that bothers you when I work by the clock?\nCritic: Somebody else has to finish your work\u2014often me. I want you to stay till\nit\u2019s done.\nYou: I appreciate your explaining to me.\nIf you wish to probe with more varied questions, review the sample queries in the Assertive\nListening section.\nClouding\nThis technique allows you to \u201cagree in part\u201d with someone without accepting that everything\nthey say is true. This calms people down and stops the win/lose arguing game.\nThe key is to find some part of what\u2019s being said that you can accept and then to acknowledge\nthat the other person is right about that. Ignore the rest of their argument. One way to agree is\nto modify words of sheer exaggeration, such as \u201calways\u201d and \u201cnever.\u201d\nexaMple #1\nCritic: You always get pissed off over little things.\nYou: It\u2019s true, there are times I find myself getting irritated.\nAdvanced Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 217\n[Page 227]\nexaMple #2\nCritic: You never support me when I need something.\nYou: It\u2019s true, there have been several times when I couldn\u2019t completely support what\nyou were asking.\nNotice how clouding steals your critic\u2019s thunder and neutralizes his or her argument. Now the\ndoor is open to real negotiation of legitimate, yet very different needs.\nAssertive Delay\nThis technique gives you room to wait, particularly when things threaten to get hot and\nangry. People will often pressure you to make a decision or agree with a plan right away. Assertive\ndelay allows you to take a break\u2014whether for a few minutes or several hours. During the interval,\nyou can calm down, think carefully about what\u2019s being said, and prepare a good response. \u201cYou\u2019ve\ntold me a lot, and I need time to sift through and see what I think.\u201d \u201cGive me an hour. This is\nimportant, and I want to think carefully before I say anything.\u201d\nHOW TO NEGOTIATE\nWhen a conflict arises that requires negotiation between you and someone else, you need to start\nfrom the position that each of you has valid needs. The RAVEN checklist will keep you on track.\nRAVEN stands for the following:\nRelax. Accept conflict calmly. Take a deep breath before you say the next thing. Release\ntension as you exhale.\nAvoid the aversive. Keep in mind the aversive strategies you might be tempted to use, and\nmonitor what you say in order to avoid them.\nValidate the other person\u2019s need or concern. Focus on a fair, mutually agreeable outcome\nwhere both people can get some of their needs met.\nExamine your values. How do you want to be treated in a relationship\u2014how do you want\nto treat others? What do you want to achieve, not only regarding the conflict, but in this\nrelationship?\nNeutral voice. Keep anger and contempt out of your voice.\nOnce you\u2019re committed to staying within the RAVEN guidelines, it\u2019s time to start the actual\nnegotiation process. It begins by each person taking turns and offering solutions. Make sure that a\n218 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 228]\nsolution you offer addresses at least some of the needs of the other person. If you aren\u2019t sure what\nthose needs are\u2014ask them.\nOnce you\u2019ve each offered several alternative solutions\u2014without agreement\u2014it\u2019s time to look\nfor a compromise. Here are some classic compromise solutions:\n\u000e I\u2019ll cut the pie; you choose the first piece. After the divorce, Sharon divided the\nartwork into two groups\u2014but Lawrence got to choose which one he\u2019d take.\n\u000e Take turns. Linda and Moe alternated between going to the mountains and the\nbeach on their vacations.\n\u000e Do both; have it all. Take care of both people\u2019s needs simultaneously.\n\u000e Trial period. Agree to a solution only for a specific length of time, after which you\u2019ll\nreevaluate. If one party feels the solution isn\u2019t working, negotiations are reopened.\n\u000e My way when I\u2019m doing it; your way when you\u2019re doing it. Each person, as he or she\ndeals with a problem, gets to use their own method. Sam and Katrina were partners\nin a small boutique. Sam thought the big \u201ccome on in\u201d sign that Katrina made was\ngarish. They agreed he wouldn\u2019t use it on his days watching the store.\n\u000e Tit for tat. Roommates Jill and Denise agreed that if Jill cleaned the bathroom once\na week, Denise would dust and vacuum once a week.\n\u000e Part of what I want with part of what you want. Two friends and coworkers planned\nto travel together to a convention. One wanted to relax on the train; one wanted\nto get there in a hurry by air. They agreed to fly one way and take the train the\nother.\n\u000e Split the difference. This often works with haggling over a price or how much time\nto spend doing something.\nExercise: How to Negotiate\nRecall three recent conflicts where you had very different needs from someone else. For each conflict, work out two possible compromises from the above list. Describe specifically how you would\nimplement them.\nAdvanced Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 219\n[Page 229]\nConflict Compromise\n1 . a.\nb.\n2 . a.\nb.\n3 . a.\nb.\nWhen working toward compromise, it\u2019s crucial to maintain flexibility. Holding a fixed,\nentrenched position makes negotiation difficult. Be open to creative, unexpected solutions. Be\nprepared to give something up to get something you want.\nHOW TO ANALYzE PROBLEM INTERACTIONS\nYou need a way to figure out what happened when communications go wrong. Inevitably, problems\nand conflicts will show up in your relationships. Sometimes you will blow up or shut down. But\nthe key is to learn from what happened and use that to polish your skills. No setback is completely\nnegative if it helps you be more effective next time.\nThe following checklist will help you review interpersonal problems and become clearer about\ntheir causes.\n220 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 230]\ncoMMunIcatIon effectIveness checklIst\n1 .

Identify the problems first, then decide which ones you want to\n222 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 232]\nwork on. Review the sections in this and the previous chapter regarding skills you want to improve.\nFinally, make a specific plan for how you are going to change your behavior next time. Don\u2019t try to\nfix too many things because you\u2019ll never remember it all. Just focus on a few changes that might\nlead to big improvements. Write down specifically what you\u2019re going to do differently and in which\nsituations.\nHere\u2019s an example. Laura used the Communication Effectiveness Checklist to evaluate an\nangry interaction with her boss. She had asked for lighter duties because of a sprained wrist. These\nare the items she checked as problems.\n\u000e Denigrating (I told him the company didn\u2019t take very good care of its employees.)\n\u000e High emotion (I got quickly upset and forgot some of my skills.)\n\u000e Myths (I feel like there\u2019s something wrong with me if I ask for anything special.)\n\u000e \u201cYou\u201d statements (I said, \u201cI feel like you don\u2019t really care what happens to people.\u201d)\n\u000e No behavioral description of need (I didn\u2019t specify exactly what \u201clight duty\u201d I was asking\nfor.)\n\u000e Blocks to listening (I used judging and sparring.)\n\u000e Mutual validation (I didn\u2019t validate his concerns.)\n\u000e Probing (I never found out his concerns.)\nLaura realized she couldn\u2019t deal with everything on her list, so she decided to focus on just\na few things:\n\u000e Denigrating and \u201cyou\u201d statements\n\u000e High emotion\n\u000e Behavioral description of need\n\u000e Probing\nHere\u2019s Laura\u2019s written plan:\nWhen I discuss this with Bob again, I\u2019m going to do the following:\n1 . Be extremely careful to make no critical statements about Bob or the company\u2014no matter\nhow upset I get.\n2 . Do a few minutes of mindful breathing to calm down before I talk to him.\n3 . Watch out for when I feel hot or I\u2019m raising my voice\u2014take a couple of deep breaths to calm\ndown then.\nAdvanced Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 223\n[Page 233]\n4 . Tell him I can do anything but collating, copying, and working with a mouse. I need to stop\ndoing those things till my wrist is better.\n5 . If he objects, I\u2019ll ask what his concern is about temporarily changing my duties. Then I\u2019ll try\nto negotiate.\nThe most important thing to remember about your new interpersonal skills is to keep working\nat them. Your persistence will benefit you. Shrug it off when things go wrong, figure out what happened, and then make a new plan. You have the ability to change your relationships and your life.\nAll you have to do is keep trying.\n224 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 234]\nchapter 10\nPutting It All Together\nThe skills you have learned in this book will grow stronger each day that you practice them.\nConversely, if your skills aren\u2019t used, they\u2019ll slip further from your grasp. They\u2019ll cease to be real\nchoices, real ways to change. Instead, they\u2019ll become mere ideas, vaguely recalled, with no power\nto help you.\nKeeping and strengthening your skills will take sustained effort. There\u2019s an old saying that\nvictory belongs to the most persevering, which is exactly what\u2019s needed now: a commitment to\npractice your skills daily\u2014over time.\nYou may wonder\u2014legitimately\u2014where you\u2019ll find the motivation to keep doing something\nso challenging. And all this talk of perseverance may sound very nineteenth century and preachy.\nBut there is a way to practice daily what you\u2019ve learned, and it doesn\u2019t take a huge amount of\nwillpower. What it requires is getting in the habit of spending about fifteen minutes a day practicing your skills.\nDAILY PRACTICES FOR EMOTIONAL HEALTH\nThe daily practices are, in essence, an exercise regimen to maintain your emotional and psychological health. The practices have five parts:\n1 . Mindfulness\n2 . Deep relaxation\n3 . Self-observation\n4 . Affirmation\n5 . Committed action\n[Page 235]\nThe daily practices take a total of about fifteen minutes. They should be done, ideally, at the\nsame time each day\u2014so they can become a healthy habit. Choose a period in your day when you\ncan be alone and have a little quiet. It could be just after your morning coffee or in your workspace\njust before going to lunch. It could be how you de-stress when you come home at night or part of\nyour bedtime routine. Whatever time you choose, stick to it. Don\u2019t let other events or commitments interfere. Consider the time spent in daily practices as an appointment with yourself\u2014no\nless important than all the other commitments that you keep.\nYour daily practices will be assembled from a menu of choices. Here\u2019s how that works:\n1 . Mindfulness. Three to five minutes. Choose to do one of the following:\n\u000e Mindful breathing (see chapter 3)\n\u000e Wise-mind meditation (see chapter 4)\n2 . Deep relaxation. Three minutes. Choose to do one of the following:\n\u000e Cue-controlled relaxation (see chapter 2)\n\u000e Band of light (see chapter 3)\n\u000e Safe-place visualization (see chapter 2)\n3 . Self-observation. Three minutes. Choose to do one of the following:\n\u000e Thought defusion (see chapter 3)\n\u000e Be mindful of your emotions without judgment (see chapter 7)\n4 . Affirmation. See chapter 2 for a list of self-affirmations or create a self-affirmation yourself. Repeat the affirmation five times while taking slow, long breaths. You can choose\na different affirmation each day\u2014or keep working on the same one.\n5 . Committed action. Three minutes. Choose to do one of the following:\n\u000e Plan to implement today\u2019s (or tomorrow\u2019s) committed action (see chapter 2).\n\u000e Plan for what you can do today (or tomorrow) to connect to your higher\npower (see chapter 2).\nEach component of your daily practices is designed to strengthen one or more core skills. First\nand foremost are mindfulness skills because all of the others depend, to some degree, on mindful\nawareness. Deep relaxation is a key to distress tolerance, while self-observation and affirmation\nwill help with emotion regulation. Finally, a plan for committed action will strengthen emotion\nregulation and interpersonal effectiveness skills.\nThe concept of committed action deserves special note. Your daily practices should include\na plan for something you\u2019ll do\u2014that day or the next\u2014to solve a problem, deal effectively with a\n226 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 236]\ndifficult situation or person, or strengthen awareness of your higher power. You can connect to your\nhigher power through prayer, an act of kindness, or some giving of yourself to others. What you\nchoose is up to you, but committed action\u2014in some form\u2014is necessary to make any real change\nin your life.\nRight now, choose the five daily practices you will use tomorrow. Then, write them here as\npart of your commitment to really do them.\nMy daIly practIces\nMindfulness:\nDeep relaxation:\nSelf-observation:\nAffirmation:\nCommitted action plan:\nWhat time each day will you do your practices? Please write that here:\nSo far, so good\u2014you know what you\u2019ll do for your daily practices and when you\u2019ll do them.\nBut now comes the most important part: persevering\u2014spending those fifteen minutes every day\nstrengthening your skills.\nHow do you persevere? The answer is one day at a time\u2014making sure that on this day, at\nthe appointed time, you do your practices. And the next day you do the same thing \u2026 and the\nnext. A commitment isn\u2019t something you make once, and you\u2019re set for life. It\u2019s something you\nkeep making, every day.\nThe daily practices will change your life because they will help you shape new responses to\nold struggles. Life isn\u2019t about hopes or intentions. It\u2019s about doing. It\u2019s about being effective. Now,\nas we close the book, we\u2019re asking you to live what you\u2019ve learned. You can do this, maybe not\nperfectly, but enough to make real changes.\nThe poet and author Samuel Johnson once said: \u201cThe future is purchased by the present.\u201d\nSimilarly, by investing in your dialectical behavior therapy skills and practices today, you can create\na happier and healthier tomorrow.\nPutting It All Together 227\n[Page 237] [Page 238]\nReferences\nAlberti, R.

[Page 11]\n1 . Distress tolerance will help you cope better with painful events by building up your\nresiliency and giving you new ways to soften the effects of upsetting circumstances. 2 . Mindfulness will help you experience more fully the present moment while focusing\nless on painful experiences from the past or frightening possibilities in the future. Mindfulness will also give you tools to overcome habitual, negative judgments about\nyourself and others. 3 .",

People struggling with overwhelming emotions often deal with their pain in very unhealthy,\nvery unsuccessful ways because they don\u2019t know what else to do. This is understandable.

In fact, in some cases, the angrier\nyou get, the worse your pain will feel (Greenwood, Thurston, Rumble, Waters, & Keefe, 2003;\nKerns, Rosenberg, & Jacob, 1994). Getting angry or upset over a situation also stops you from seeing what is really happening. Have you ever heard the expression \u201cbeing blinded by rage\u201d? This often happens to people with\noverwhelming emotions. Criticizing yourself all the time or being overly judgmental of a situation is\nlike wearing dark sunglasses indoors.",

By doing this, you\u2019re missing the details and not seeing everything as it really is. By getting angry and thinking that a situation should never have happened,\nyou\u2019re missing the point that it did happen and that you have to deal with it. Being overly critical about a situation prevents you from taking steps to change that situation. You can\u2019t change the past.

Obviously, getting angry, upset, or critical doesn\u2019t\nimprove a situation. So what else can you do?

For example, if you\u2019re in an abusive relationship and you need to\nget out, then get out. Don\u2019t waste your time and continue to suffer by blaming yourself or the other\nperson.

Strangely, many of the stars you\u2019re looking at have already died, but their light is just reaching your eyes on the Earth. Look up at the stars and recognize that whatever created them\nalso created you, whether it was God or a cosmic accident. You are connected to the stars.

Here\u2019s an example of preparing for both kinds of situations. Carl identified a distressing situation that occurred when he was with someone else. He wrote: \u201cWhen I\u2019m with my brother, he\nalways corrects everything I do.\u201d This is a good situation for Carl to examine because it\u2019s predictable that the next time he\u2019s with his brother, Carl will experience a similar distressing situation. Next, Carl identified how he usually coped with that situation with his brother, using his old\ncoping strategies. He wrote: \u201cWe fight. I eat too much. I scratch myself. I think about all the times\nhe\u2019s insulted me in the past.\u201d",

I get cuts all over my face and arms. I feel horrible for days thinking\nabout the past.\u201d Obviously, none of Carl\u2019s strategies has had any long-term benefits. Next, Carl\nidentified new distress tolerance skills he could use the next time this situation arose with his\nbrother. Under \u201cNew Coping Strategies,\u201d Carl wrote the most appropriate distress tolerance skills\nfor this type of situation. He chose them from the skills he found helpful in the last two chapters. He wrote: \u201cTake a time-out. Use my new coping thought: \u2018I\u2019m strong and I can deal with him.\u2019 Radically accept myself and the situation in a new way.\u201d Then he predicted what the healthier\npossible consequences of these new strategies would be: \u201cWe won\u2019t fight as much. I won\u2019t eat as\nmuch. I\u2019ll feel stronger.",

But these coping strategies are probably different from the strategies he might choose when\nhe\u2019s in a distressing situation by himself. So Carl also filled out the worksheet for coping with distressing situations when he\u2019s alone. The situation he selected was: \u201cSometimes I feel scared when\nI\u2019m alone.\u201d Again, this is a good situation for Carl to examine because it\u2019s predictable that he will\nexperience this same overwhelming feeling the next time he\u2019s alone.

But for the purposes of this workbook, let\u2019s be very clear about why you\nneed to learn mindfulness skills. There are three reasons:\n1 . Mindfulness skills will help you focus on one thing at a time in the present moment, and\nby doing this you can better control and soothe your overwhelming emotions. 2 . Mindfulness will help you learn to identify and separate judgmental thoughts from your\nexperiences. These judgmental thoughts often fuel your overwhelming emotions. 3 .",

As a result, she felt unworthy of anyone\u2019s love and\nresigned herself to spend the rest of her life living alone. Unfortunately, both Leo and Takeesha were overcome by what dialectical behavior therapy\ncalls emotion mind (Linehan, 1993a). Emotion mind occurs when you make judgments or decisions\nbased solely on how you feel. But keep in mind that emotions themselves are not bad or problematic. We all need emotions to live healthy lives. ( You\u2019ll learn more about the role of emotions in\nchapters 6 and 7.)",

The problems associated with emotion mind develop when your emotions control\nyour life. This trap is especially dangerous for people with overwhelming emotions because emotion\nmind distorts your thoughts and judgments and then these distortions make it hard to formulate\nhealthy decisions about your life. Consider what happened to Leo and Takeesha: despite their\nsuccesses, their emotions overwhelmed their lives and led them to make unhealthy decisions.

Again, let\u2019s consider the examples of Leo and\nTakeesha. Both of them were being controlled by their emotion minds. If Leo had been making\ndecisions with wise mind, before quitting his job he would have balanced his decision with reasonable mind. He should have reminded himself of the facts of the situation: he was already a successful salesman, and he only became upset when he couldn\u2019t close a deal. Therefore, was it reasonable\nthat he should quit? Definitely not. What about Takeesha?",

You can develop wise mind by using the mindfulness skills you have already been practicing in chapter 3.

WISE MIND AND INTuITION\nAccording to dialectical behavior therapy, wise mind is similar to intuition (Linehan, 1993b). Often, both intuition and wise mind are described as \u201cfeelings\u201d that come from \u201cthe gut\u201d or the\nstomach area. The exercise that follows will help you get more in touch with your gut feelings,\nboth physically and mentally. This exercise will help you locate the center of wise mind in your\nbody. This is the spot from which many people report making sensible, wise-mind decisions about\ntheir lives.",

Checking in with your center of wise mind is\nsimply one way that often works for some people. However, some words of caution are needed here. When you first use wise mind to make decisions about your life, it will probably be difficult to\ntell the difference between an intuitive gut feeling and a decision made the old way with emotion\nmind. The difference can be determined in three ways:\n1 . When you made your decision were you being mindful of both your emotions and the facts\nof the situation?

Thomas struggled with a problem that\u2019s very common for people\nwith overwhelming emotions. He divided everyone and everything into two categories: they were\neither all good or all bad. There was no in-between for him. When people treated him nicely,\nthey were good, but when someone disagreed with him, he considered them to be bad, even if the\nperson had just been on his good side a few minutes before.

Over the years, the accumulation of fluctuations and judgments made Thomas very sensitive to\nsituations that could go wrong. He always expected that other people would make mistakes, insult\nhim, or betray him in some way. One time his sister said that she couldn\u2019t help him take his car\nto the repair shop, and Thomas blew up at her. He criticized her for being ungrateful and selfish. However, the truth was that she had to take her own daughter to the doctor, but Thomas never\nheard her reasoning.",

He was too wrapped up in his own judgmental thinking to really listen to\nanyone else. In truth, Thomas had created a pattern in his life where all of his judgments and\ncritical thinking became realities, and this led to a very lonely and distressing life. When Thomas was finally introduced to the skill of radical acceptance, he was critical of it\ntoo. \u201c This is ridiculous,\u201d he thought, \u201cThis stupid idea isn\u2019t going to help me.

Slowly his thinking began to change. Thomas spent less time obsessing over\njudgmental thoughts and critical remarks, and he spent less time anticipating that other people\nwould insult or betray him. He also no longer thought of people as either just good or bad. He\nbegan to recognize that everyone makes mistakes, and that\u2019s okay.

You\u2019ll no longer spend\nas much time judging yourself and others, and so you\u2019ll be free to do many other things instead. Radical acceptance is one of the most important tools to learn in dialectical behavior therapy, and\nit\u2019s definitely worth the effort. Exercise: Negative Judgments\nThe first step to changing a problem is to recognize when that problem occurs.

One of the solutions is to turn \u201cyou\u201d statements into mindful \u201cI\u201d statements. \u000e Mindful \u201cI\u201d statements are based on your own mindful awareness of how you feel. \u000e Mindful \u201cI\u201d statements are a more accurate description of how you feel. \u000e Mindful \u201cI\u201d statements let a person know how you feel in a nonjudgmental way. \u000e Mindful \u201cI\u201d statements evoke greater empathy and understanding from the other\nperson, which allows the person to meet your needs.",

Instead of saying \u201cYou make me mad,\u201d say \u201cRight now, I feel very mad.\u201d Doesn\u2019t that sound\nless judgmental and blaming? If someone said the alternative statement to you (\u201cI feel very mad\u201d),\nwouldn\u2019t you be more willing to discuss the situation? Wouldn\u2019t you feel less angry? Look at the second sentence. Instead of saying \u201cYou\u2019re such a jerk, I could scream,\u201d say \u201cI\nfeel so angry right now I could scream.\u201d Do you hear the difference it makes to change a \u201cyou\u201d\nstatement into an \u201cI\u201d statement?",

Exercise: Mindful \u201cI\u201d Statements\nNow let\u2019s look at some more judgmental \u201cyou\u201d statements and have you practice turning them into\nmindful \u201cI\u201d statements. Write your alternative mindful \u201cI\u201d statement in the space to the right of\nthe judgmental statement. 1 . \u201c You make me feel horrible.\u201d 2 . \u201c I know you\u2019re doing this on purpose to make me go crazy.\u201d 3 . \u201c Why do you keep making me feel so angry?\u201d 4 . \u201c",

Did it get harder to think of mindful \u201cI\u201d statements as the exercise progressed? Some of the later sentences probably required extra thinking. Let\u2019s look at some possible\nanswers. The first sentence was easy. The message is that the speaker feels horrible. So an alternative\nmindful \u201cI\u201d statement could be \u201cI feel horrible\u201d or \u201cI feel horrible sometimes, when you (say that,\ndo that, and so on).\u201d In the second sentence, the speaker feels crazy, anxious, or upset.",

So maybe the speaker feels hurt, and an\nalternative mindful \u201cI\u201d statement could be \u201cI feel hurt when you do that.\u201d The eighth sentence is trickier.

In his book Living the Mindful Life: A Handbook for Living in the Present Moment, psychologist\nCharles Tart (1994, p. 13) remarks: \u201cIt does not take a really strenuous effort to make yourself\nbecome mindful and more present. The effort is very small. The problem is remembering to do it! We forget all the time. It is not hard, but we just do not remember to do it.\u201d So how should you\nremember to be mindful?

In some of the exercises in this chapter,\nyou might have used a special ring or bracelet to remind yourself. Or maybe you used sticky notes. If those tools helped you, continue to use them to remind yourself to stay mindful. However, the best way to continue to stay mindful in your daily life is to practice being\nmindful.

Doing tasks mindfully\nMindful breathing is a skill you learned in chapter 3, Basic Mindfulness Skills. Remember, to\nbreathe mindfully, you need to focus on three parts of the experience:\n1 . You must count your breaths. This will help you focus your attention, and it will also\nhelp you calm your mind when you\u2019re distracted by thoughts. 2 . You need to focus on the physical experience of breathing. This is accomplished by\nobserving the rising and falling of your breath as you slowly inhale and exhale. 3 .

But it is also the most important time to be mindful, especially for someone struggling with\noverwhelming emotions. Here\u2019s an example.

At first, she was positive that\nshe would find the \u201cperfect\u201d dress in the store she really liked because they always had the \u201cbest\u201d\nclothes. But quickly, Claire recognized the positive judgments she was making, and she let them go. That was lucky too, because none of the stores she liked had the dress she was looking for.

Instantly, she knew it was a very bad idea to\nbuy the expensive dress, so she gave it back to the salesclerk and left the store. Claire was proud of herself for making the right decision, but the drama didn\u2019t end there. Laura began making fun of Claire for being \u201ctoo cheap\u201d to buy the dress.

Claire was proud of herself for making the right decision, but the drama didn\u2019t end there. Laura began making fun of Claire for being \u201ctoo cheap\u201d to buy the dress. Again, Claire\u2019s mind\nbegan to fill with judgments about Laura. She did her best to let them go, but as Laura continued\nto ridicule her, Claire\u2019s only goal became leaving the mall and dropping Laura at home. Internally,\nClaire wanted to scream at Laura, but she knew that would end up in a big fight. Claire thought\nabout doing what was effective in that moment. She knew that she just had to get home as quickly\nand safely as possible without getting into a fight that she might later regret. Claire drove home silently, listening to Laura\u2019s criticisms. She was relieved when she finally\nlet Laura off at her house.",

But\nhopefully, you see the benefits of using mindfulness in all of your daily tasks. In the beginning of chapter 3, Basic Mindfulness Skills, you learned that there were three\nmain reasons why you should learn mindfulness skills:\n1 . They will help you focus on one thing at a time in the present moment, and by doing\nthis you can better control and soothe your overwhelming emotions. 2 . They will help you learn to identify and separate judgmental thoughts from your\nexperiences. 3 . They will help you develop wise mind. Unfortunately, there is no shortcut to becoming instantaneously and permanently mindful. But as Dr. Charles Tart said, learning how to be mindful isn\u2019t a strenuous activity; you simply\nhave to remember to do it.",

Sheila noticed her smile and thought, \u201cShe\nmust be happy to see me too.\u201d So Sheila smiled as well.

A\nsmile is a smile no matter where you were born. These are just two very simple examples, but you can see that emotions serve many purposes.

She\nwanted to hit him, but she didn\u2019t. After a few minutes, Ling started to feel hopeless and ashamed\ntoo. She had tried everything to help her husband, but nothing seemed to work. She didn\u2019t feel like\nshe could stay in her marriage any longer, but she also didn\u2019t believe in divorce. Ling went to the\nbathroom and locked herself in.

That night she forgot to set her alarm because she was too upset, so she missed the first few\nhours of work and got reprimanded by her manager. Ling\u2019s story is common for many people. Using this story, let\u2019s follow the six-step process that\nwill help you recognize your emotions (Linehan, 1993b). 1 . What happened? This is your opportunity to describe the situation that led to your emotions. In this example, Ling comes home and once again finds her husband drunk. He\nrefuses to get help or to talk about his problem. 2 . Why do you think that situation happened? This is an opportunity for you to identify the\npotential causes of your situation.",

This is a very important step because the meaning\nthat you give to the event will often determine what your emotional reaction is to that\nevent. For example, if you think someone hurt you on purpose, you will react very differently than if you think someone hurt you by accident. Here, Ling believes that her\nhusband is an alcoholic who hates her and regrets marrying her in the first place, so he\nhas just given up on his life to hurt her. 3 . How did the situation make you feel, both emotionally and physically? Try to identify both\nprimary and secondary emotions if you can. Learning how to identify your emotions will\ntake practice, but it will be worth the effort that you make. If you need help finding\nwords to describe how you feel, see the List of Commonly Felt Emotions in chapter 3.",

Physically, she notices that all the muscles in her face and\narms become very tense, and she feels sick to her stomach. 4 . What did you want to do as a result of how you felt?

If you can control some\nurges, chances are good that you can control other urges too. In this example, Ling had\nthe urge to do two things that would have been very dangerous and deadly: hit her\nhusband and kill herself to end her pain. Thankfully, she didn\u2019t do either one, which\nlater gave her hope that she could control other urges as well. 5 . What did you do and say? This is where you identify what you actually did as a result\nof your emotions. In this example, Ling locks herself in her bathroom and begins to\nmutilate herself. She also yells at her husband and calls him a \u201cworthless drunk.\u201d 6 . How did your emotions and actions affect you later?",

So\nthe question remains: why do people do these types of things? The answer lies in your emotions. Let\u2019s start with the basics: many behaviors are repeated because they are rewarded. A person\ngoes to work for the reward of a paycheck. A student goes to school for the reward of a degree. People play sports for the reward of competing. A musician plays an instrument for the reward of\n132 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 142]\ncreating music. And a gardener plants flowers for the reward of seeing them blossom. All of these\nrewards reinforce these behaviors and make them more likely to be repeated in the future.

And if you only got weeds every\ntime you planted a garden, you\u2019d probably stop doing that too. In the same way, your emotions can serve as rewards that reinforce your behavior. Here\u2019s a\nsimple example of how pleasurable emotions can reinforce a behavior: Phil helped his friend Stefan\nmove into a new apartment (a behavior). Stefan was very grateful, which made Phil feel happy\nabout helping him (an emotion). So the next time Stefan asked for a favor, Phil was happy to help\nhim again (another behavior) because it would make him feel good again (another emotion).

But you\ncan also be overwhelmed by your emotions when you only pay attention to part of what\u2019s really\nhappening. This type of thinking is called filtering (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979).

Remember, your thoughts greatly influence\nhow you feel. But if your thoughts about a situation are being filtered and you\u2019re not seeing the\nbig picture, your thoughts are more likely to cause overwhelming, distressing emotions. In Zeva\u2019s\nexample, she thought, \u201cI\u2019m such a loser,\u201d and then she felt overwhelmed, upset, and angry.

Similarly, you need to examine more of the facts and evidence that affect your situation and\nmake up your big picture. As you saw earlier in the examples, people often filter out the positive\nelements of their lives and ignore the facts that might change the way they feel about a situation. If\nyou really want to stop being overwhelmed by your emotions, you\u2019ll have to look at all those facts. 152 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 162]\nRemember what Zeva filtered out?

Using these skills, Zeva\u2019s answer could have been something\nlike, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to feel disappointed because I studied a lot and I didn\u2019t do well. But this is just one\nbad grade.

For example, Zeva could have used some of the distress tolerance\nand self-soothing skills to calm her emotions, like talking to a friend or listening to some relaxing\nmusic. She could also have used her mindfulness skills, like mindful breathing or thought defusion.

As a result,\nthey focus only on their distressing emotions, such as anger, fear, and sadness, and they rarely\nnotice their pleasurable emotions, such as happiness, surprise, and love. Maybe that\u2019s what you did before, but now you know that it\u2019s very important for you to\nbegin noticing your pleasurable emotions. As you continue to use dialectical behavior therapy to\nimprove your life, you\u2019ll want to find more ways of experiencing pleasurable emotions, if you don\u2019t\nhave enough of them in your life already. This doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ll never experience another\ndistressing feeling. That\u2019s impossible. We all have distressing emotions at different points in our\nlives. But your life doesn\u2019t have to be dominated by them.",

First, you will learn to observe the natural life cycle of your emotions, watching them rise\nand fall, shift and change as new emotions replace old ones.

When you have a\nstrong emotion, it affects behavior in two ways. First, you change your facial expression and body\nlanguage to reflect your feeling. If you\u2019re angry, you may begin to scowl and tighten your fists. On the other hand, if you\u2019re scared, your eyes may open wide while you hunch your shoulders. The second behavioral change comes from action urges that accompany every emotion. Anger,\nfor example, may produce urges to shout or hit, while fear might push you to cower or back away.

Advanced Emotion Regulation Skills 167\n[Page 177]\nDOING THE OPPOSITE OF YOuR\nEMOTIONAL uRGES\nThere are good reasons for feeling whatever it is you feel. Even when they are painful, your emotions are legitimate and valid. The larger problem is emotion-driven behavior, because acting on\nemotions often creates destructive outcomes. Letting anger drive you to attack with words can\ndisrupt your relationships. Letting fear drive you to avoid critical tasks and challenges can paralyze\nyou at work. A second problem with acting on emotion-driven impulses is that they intensify your original\nfeeling. Instead of getting relief, you may get even more consumed with the emotion.",

This is where\nopposite action comes in. Rather than fueling your emotion, opposite action helps to regulate and\nchange it. Here are some examples of opposite action.

Notice that opposite action changes both body language (posture, facial expression) and\nactual behavior. Opposite action isn\u2019t about denying or pretending an emotion isn\u2019t happening. Rather, it is about regulation. You acknowledge the emotion but use the opposite behavior to reduce\nit or encourage a new emotion. 168 The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook\n[Page 178]\nThere are six steps to creating opposite action:\n1 . Start by acknowledging what you feel. Describe the emotion in words. 2 . Ask yourself if there\u2019s a good reason to regulate or reduce the intensity of this emotion. Is it overpowering you?",

What\u2019s your facial\nexpression, your posture? What are you saying and how are you saying it? What,\nspecifically, do you do in response to the emotion? 4 . Identify opposite action. How can you relax your face and body so it doesn\u2019t scream \u201cI\u2019m\nangry\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m scared\u201d?

How long will you\nmaintain the opposite behavior? As you think about making a commitment, keep in\nmind why you want to regulate your emotions. What\u2019s happened in the past when you\ngave in to emotion-driven behavior? Were there serious costs to you, to others? 6 . Monitor your emotions. As you do opposite action, notice how the original emotion may\nchange or evolve. Opposite action literally sends a message to the brain that the old\nemotion is no longer appropriate\u2014and it helps you shift to a less painful emotion.

In addition, we\u2019ve added negotiation skills (Fisher & Ury, 1991) to complete the\nprogram. Relationships are precious, and they are vulnerable. They bring love, companionship, and\nsupport. Yet, sometimes in a matter of moments, they can become broken beyond repair.

Exercise: Mindful Attention\nIn the very next conversation you have, practice being an observer of the moment by attending to\nthe other person\u2019s physical and verbal behavior. If you find anything ambiguous or hard to read,\nask a clarifying question. Here are some examples:\n\u000e How are you feeling? Are you doing okay? \u000e How are we doing? Are we okay? \u000e How are things between us?",

When you give in to others and abandon your own needs, it\ncreates frustration and resentment that builds inside of you. Eventually, the relationship becomes so\npainful that you blow up, collapse into depression, or run away. The paradox of being passive is that\nin the short term, giving in seems to protect the relationship. Long term, however, the relationship\ntakes a shape you can\u2019t stand\u2014and you have to destroy it to stop the pain.

The second source of aggression is a need to control interpersonal events. Things have to\ngo a certain way, and you expect certain outcomes to happen or not happen.

We are not sufficient unto\nourselves, and our whole lives are spent negotiating with others for everything we\nrequire to survive\u2014physically and emotionally.

Ideally, keep it to one sentence. Offer no\nexcuses or explanations. Stand or sit straight, talk in a strong, firm voice. Then just keep repeating\nthe statement as many times as necessary, varying a word here or there\u2014but not much else. Don\u2019t argue, don\u2019t get angry, and don\u2019t try to debate or refute anything the other person says. Don\u2019t answer any \u201cwhy\u201d questions (\u201cWhy do you want to . . .\u201d) because that just gives the other\nperson ammunition for their arguments.
