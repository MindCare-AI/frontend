/**
 * Modal.tsx Fix Summary
 * 
 * Problem Fixed:
 * - SyntaxError: 'return' outside of function
 * - The error was caused by an extra closing curly brace in the Modal component
 * - This brace prematurely terminated the component function, causing the return statement
 *   to be outside any function scope
 * 
 * Changes Made:
 * 1. Removed the extra closing brace after:
 *    const fadeAnim = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current
 *    const slideAnim = useRef(new Animated.Value(50)).current
 *    }  <-- This extra brace was removed
 * 
 * 2. Maintained the existing logic for renderSafeChildren function that:
 *    - Filters out problematic text nodes (periods, whitespace)
 *    - Wraps string and number content in Text components
 *    - Assigns unique keys to all elements
 * 
 * 3. Kept all existing functionality:
 *    - Modal animations work as expected
 *    - Content rendering is preserved
 *    - All props are handled correctly
 *    
 * Testing Steps:
 * 1. Restart development server
 * 2. Open application and navigate to the appointment booking screen
 * 3. Verify modal opens and closes smoothly
 * 4. Check that no "Unexpected text node" errors occur
 * 5. Confirm all UI elements render correctly
